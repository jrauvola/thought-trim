  "problem": "Distinguish between structural genes, regulatory genes, promotor genes, and operator genes.\n\nA. Operator genes code for proteins, regulatory genes bind to repressor molecules, structural genes are related with RNA polymerase, and promotor genes prevent gene activity\n\nB. Regulatory genes code for RNA polymerase, operator genes code for structural proteins, promotor genes are associated with enzymes, and structural genes bind to repressor molecules.\n\nC. Structural genes code for repressor molecules, regulatory genes serve as a binding site for RNA polymerase, operator genes are associated with enzymes, and promotor genes control a group of structural genes.\n\nD. Operator genes serve as a binding site for RNA polymerase, regulatory genes control a group of structural genes, structural genes code for inhibitory proteins, and promotor genes code for repressor molecules.\n\nE. Promotor genes code for repressors, operator genes are related with RNA polymerase, regulatory genes are associated with enzymes, and structural genes control a group of genes\n\nF. Promotor genes control a group of operator genes, structural genes bind to repressor molecules, regulatory genes serve as a binding site for RNA polymerase, and operator genes code for enzymes.\n\nG. Operator genes code for structural units, structural genes serve as a binding site for RNA polymerase, regulatory genes control a group of operator genes, and promotor genes code for inhibitory proteins known as repressors.\n\nH. Regulatory genes code for enzymes, operator genes bind to repressor molecules, promotor genes code for proteins, and structural genes prevent gene activity\n\nI. Structural genes code for proteins required as enzymes or structural units, regulatory genes code for inhibitory proteins known as repressors, operator genes control a group of structural genes, and promotor genes serve as a binding site for RNA polymerase.\n\nJ. Structural genes code for RNA polymerase, regulatory genes code for structural components, operator genes serve as a binding site for repressors, and promotor genes control a group of regulatory genes.",
