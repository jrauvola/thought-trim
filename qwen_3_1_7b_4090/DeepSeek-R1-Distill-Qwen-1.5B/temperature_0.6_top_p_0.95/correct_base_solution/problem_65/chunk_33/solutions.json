Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why neurotransmitters only go from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite instead of the other way around. Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I is probably wrong. Option J says they can travel both ways. Again, contradicts the given scenario. So now I'm left with options C and G. Let me think again. If neurotransmitters are only in the axon, where do they go? They'd need a pathway through the axon to the next cell. But if they are all in the axon ends, maybe they don't leave the axon. Unless the axon somehow releases them before reaching the postsynaptic area. But typically, neurotransmitters are held in the axon and only sent when the axon reaches the cell body. So perhaps option C is correct, meaning they're only in the axon ends because they don't leave the axon. Alternatively, maybe the release process is such that once inside, they don't leave until necessary. Or perhaps the axon terminals lack the ability to release neurotransmitters, so they accumulate in the axon. Wait, but option E says axonal terminals don't release, so neurotransmitters wouldn't get into the cells. That can't be right because the question says they are transmitted. So E is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first.

But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet.

Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's not right. Option J says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter to negate. Again, that would allow bidirectional movement, which isn't the case here. So J's also incorrect. Now, looking back at the options, none seem directly related except possibly option G, but it's about passive transport rather than directionality. However, considering all the options provided, the most plausible explanation is that the action potential reaches the dendrite, which then releases the neurotransmitter. Since the question specifies that neurotransmitters are sent unidirectionally, the correct answer should align with that mechanism. Among the given options, option A talks about electrical signals from axons to dendrites, which fits because the signal propagates along the axon, reaching the postsynaptic area where neurotransmitters are released. So A seems like the best choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's probably wrong. Option J says dendrites release another neurotransmitter to negate. That also complicates things and doesn't fit the observation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why neurotransmitters only go from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite instead of the other way around. Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's probably not correct. Option J suggests both directions. Again, contradicts the given information. So the remaining options are G and H. Since the movement is unidirectional, the reason should relate to how neurotransmitters get into the postsynaptic area. Option G explains why, but it's more about the process rather than why it happens. Option H also talks about the process but again, it's about the directionality. Since the question asks why it's unidirectional, I think the best fit is H, where the structure of the dendrites pumps them back, making it impossible for them to go backward. Alternatively, G is about the actual transport mechanism. But since the question is about why it moves that way, H might be the better answer because it directly addresses the phenomenon described.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles.

They're released when the action potential triggers ion channels opening, allowing the neurotransmitter to flow into the postsynaptic neuron's membrane.

Option G says the postsynaptic area actively pumps neurotransmitters back. If that's true, then the movement is unidirectional, but the postsynaptic area can still send it back. Wait, no\u2014if the postsynaptic area can't receive, then it can't send back, but if it can, then it can. So the question says it's always moving forward, so the postsynaptic area must allow sending back. Hence, G is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first.

But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet.

If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back.

But the question is about their directionality, not their origin. So maybe A isn't the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the lack of release elsewhere leads to the correct direction. Or maybe the timing of neurotransmitter release affects where they go. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Another angle: when neurotransmitters are released, they need to bind to receptors. If all axons had receptors, neurotransmitters should flow in any direction. But since it's only one way, perhaps another factor is at play. Maybe the presence of certain ion channels or other structures ensures that neurotransmitters can only pass through specific parts of the axon. But without knowing more, it's hard to pinpoint. Alternatively, maybe the release process requires an activation signal that only propagates in one direction. For example, if neurotransmitters are only released when a voltage gradient is established upstream, which might favor the unidirectional path. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the options, I think the most plausible explanation is that the absence of a mechanism allowing neurotransmitters to form vesicles on the postsynaptic side prevents them from reaching the postsynaptic area. But none of the options directly state that. Wait, option E says axonal terminals don't release neurotransmitters, but the question is about their movement, not production. Option A talks about the release being stimulated by electrical signals. If only one direction allows the signal to propagate, that might allow neurotransmitters to be released only in that direction. Maybe when the signal reaches a certain point, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters. So perhaps A is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's not correct. Option J says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates the effect. Again, this would allow bidirectional movement, which isn't happening here. So J is out. Finally, option K is not listed, but looking back, perhaps I missed an option. Wait, the options provided don't include K, so maybe none of these are correct. But that can't be right because the question expects one answer. Maybe I overlooked something. Let me think again. The key point is that neurotransmitters travel from presynaptic axon to postsynaptic dends. Why can't they go the other way? Well, if the presynaptic area couldn't send them back, that would explain it. Looking at the options, E says axonal terminals don't release neurotransmitters. But wait, the terminals are where neurotransmitters are released, aren't they? Or does the terminal act as a gate? Alternatively, maybe the terminals themselves don't release neurotransmitters, so they just allow them to enter. But I'm getting confused. Another angle: if the release happens downstream (postsynaptic), then the axon shouldn't be releasing. So if axon terminals can't release, that stops the signal, making the movement unidirectional. So maybe E is the answer. But earlier I thought E said \"axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters.\" Wait, the term \"machinery\" refers to the ability to release them. So if the terminals can't release, then neurotransmitters can't get in, which would block the signal. That fits. So the reason is that the terminals can't release neurotransmitters, hence the signal stops. Therefore, the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Since neurotransmitters aren't stored in the axon (they usually pass through), their release must happen somehow. Option C says the neurotransmitter is present only in the axon end. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because they have to get into the cell before they can leave. Unless they're not retained, perhaps due to being degraded when they arrive.

But that's option E. However, the question is asking why they don't go the other way, so E wouldn't explain that. Instead, the lack of release machinery on the axon terminals would prevent neurotransmitters from entering the cell. But the problem says they are always moving forward, so perhaps the axon terminals don't release them because they can't form vesicles or something. Alternatively, maybe the presence of certain ions or signaling pathways inhibits their release. \n\nAlternatively, considering the structure of neurons: Neurons have two types of terminal cells\u2014axons and dendrites. The axon receives inputs via its terminals, while the dendrites receive inputs from many places. Transmitters are usually made in the cytoplasm near the axon terminals and are stored there. When a signal arrives, they are released from the axon terminals into the synaptic vesicles, which fuse with the dendrites of the next cell. If the axon terminals didn't release them, they wouldn't enter the cell, so neurotransmitters wouldn't get to the postsynaptic area. Therefore, the absence of axon-terminal release machinery would prevent neurotransmitters from traveling the path described. Looking at the options, option E says axonal terminals don't release neurotransmitters. So if E is correct, neurotransmitters wouldn't enter the cell, thus not reaching the postsynaptic area. But wait, the question says they are always moving forward, implying they do get into the cell. So perhaps my reasoning is off. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe the action potential depolarizes the membrane, making the axon terminals unable to release neurotransmitters because they can't undergo the necessary changes. Alternatively, the presence of ion channels or pumps that block the release.

Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's not correct. Option J says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter to negate the effect. Again, this would allow backward movement, which isn't what's happening here. So J is also incorrect. \n\nNow, looking back at the options, the correct reason should relate to the structure of the neurons and how neurotransmitters are released. Since neurotransmitters aren't stored in the axon (they usually pass through), their release must happen somehow. Option C says the neurotransmitter is present only in the axon end. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because they have to get into the cell before they can leave. Unless they're not retained, perhaps due to being degraded when they arrive. Alternatively, maybe the axon terminals don't release them, so they don't get into the cell. Wait, but the question implies they do get into the cell because they're transmitted. So maybe option C is suggesting they don't stay in the axon. Or perhaps option G is referring to them staying in the axon but being pumped back. But the problem states they're always moving forward. \n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the axon terminals lack the machinery to release neurotransmitters, like how the postsynaptic area does. But that's option E. However, the question is asking why they don't go the other way, so E wouldn't explain that. Instead, the lack of release machinery on the axon terminals would prevent neurotransmitters from entering the cell. But the problem says they are always moving forward, so perhaps the axon terminals don't release them because they can't form vesicles or something. Alternatively, maybe the presence of certain ions or signaling pathways inhibits their release. \n\nAlternatively, considering the structure of neurons: Neurons have two types of terminal cells\u2014axons and dendrites. The axon receives inputs via its terminals, while the dendrites receive inputs from many places. Transmitters are usually made in the cytoplasm near the axon terminals and are stored there. When a signal arrives, they are released from the axon terminals into the synaptic vesicles, which fuse with the dendrites of the next cell. If the axon terminals didn't release them, they wouldn't enter the cell, so neurotransmitters wouldn't get to the postsynaptic area. Therefore, the absence of axon-terminal release machinery would prevent neurotransmitters from traveling the path described. Looking at the options, option E says axonal terminals don't release neurotransmitters. So if E is correct, neurotransmitters wouldn't enter the cell, thus not reaching the postsynaptic area. But wait, the question says they are always moving forward, implying they do get into the cell. So perhaps my reasoning is off. \n\nAnother angle: Maybe the action potential depolarizes the membrane, making the axon terminals unable to release neurotransmitters because they can't undergo the necessary changes. Alternatively, the presence of ion channels or pumps that block the release. But none of these options seem directly listed except for E. \n\nSo putting it all together, the most plausible answer is E: Axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Option B talks about receptors on axons, but perhaps that's not the issue. Alternatively, maybe it's about the structure of neurons. Option G suggests that the movement is maintained because of passive transport or something, but the question asks why it's unidirectional. Another angle is that in unidirectional systems, the release mechanisms differ. Option E says axonal terminals don't release, which would mean neurotransmitters can't get in. But since they're always moving forward, E is incorrect. Option C might refer to the fact that axons don't keep neurotransmitters long enough, making them only in the axon terminal, thus preventing them from reaching the postsynaptic area. \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me reevaluate. The key point is that the neurotransmitters are always going from axon to postsynaptic. So why wouldn't they go back? Maybe because the axon has a natural mechanism to send them away once they're inside. For example, the postsynaptic potentials cause the release of other neurotransmitters, or the axon might have a signal that prevents them from coming back. Or perhaps the process is such that the axon sends them via ion channels or other mechanisms that ensure they leave eventually. \n\nLooking at the options again, option G refers to the postsynaptic dends having their own structures, but that doesn't directly address the directionality. Option H suggests that the postsynaptic areas pump neurotransmitters back, which would allow bidirectional communication, contradicting the observation. Option F says they degrade immediately, which isn't the case. Option C says the neurotransmitter is present only in the axonal end, meaning they can't reach the postsynaptic area. But in reality, neurotransmitters are inside the axon and leave through various channels. So maybe C isn't correct. Alternatively, the lack of receptors on the axons might prevent neurotransmitters from entering, but that's not stated in the options. \n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is G. Because in some cases, the postsynaptic dends have their own structures that pump neurotransmitters back, allowing bidirectional communication. But the question says they're always going forward, so G might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but I thought E said terminals don't release. Since the terminals can't release, neurotransmitters can't get in, which would prevent any movement. But the problem says they do move, so E is incorrect. \n\nAnother possibility is that the postsynaptic cells have certain mechanisms to ensure they receive neurotransmitters and not send them back. For example, the postsynaptic dends might have ion channels that allow them to receive neurotransmitters but block them from leaving. If the axon terminals have ion channels that send neurotransmitters, but the dends block them, that would make the movement unidirectional. Looking at the options, none mention ion channels specifically. However, option G talks about active transport, which could involve pumping. Option H is similar. \n\nBut the question asks why the movement is unidirectional, not necessarily about the mechanics behind it. So perhaps the best fit is option G, as it explains that the postsynaptic regions pump the neurotransmitters back, maintaining the directionality. But earlier reasoning suggested that G might not directly address the direction. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that contradicts the problem statement. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to recall. In many neural pathways, the action potential depolarizes the membrane, causing the release of neurotransmitters. Once inside the postsynaptic cell, they can either stay there (like GABA) or undergo ionotropic or metabotropic receptor currents, which allow them to return. If the postsynaptic cells have these pumps, the neurotransmitters can't flow back, keeping the connection unidirectional. But the question is about why the movement is always forward, not about the maintenance of it. \n\nGiven the options, I think the most plausible answer is E, but that contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, the closest is G. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the correct answer is E, but I'm confused now.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why neurotransmitters only go from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite instead of the other way around. Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. Option J says another neurotransmitter negates the effect. Again, this implies bidirectional movement, which isn't what's happening here. \n\nSo putting it all together, the correct answer should relate to why neurotransmitters aren't being released elsewhere. Option B talks about receptors on axons, but perhaps that's not the issue. Alternatively, maybe it's about the structure of neurons. Option G suggests that the movement is maintained because of passive transport or something, but the question asks why it's unidirectional. Another angle is that in unidirectional systems, the release mechanisms differ. Option E says axonal terminals don't release, which would mean neurotransmitters can't get in. But since they're always moving forward, E is incorrect. Option C might refer to the fact that axons don't keep neurotransmitters long enough, making them only in the axon terminal, thus preventing them from reaching the postsynaptic area. \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me reevaluate. The key point is that the neurotransmitters are always going from axon to postsynaptic. So why wouldn't they go back? Maybe because the axon has a natural mechanism to send them away once they're inside. For example, the postsynaptic potentials cause the release of other neurotransmitters, or the axon might have a signal that prevents them from coming back. Or perhaps the process is such that the axon sends them via ion channels or other mechanisms that ensure they leave eventually. \n\nLooking at the options again, option G refers to the postsynaptic dends having their own structures, but that doesn't directly address the directionality. Option H suggests that the postsynaptic areas pump neurotransmitters back, which would allow bidirectional communication, contradicting the observation. Option F says they degrade immediately, which isn't the case. Option C says the neurotransmitter is present only in the axonal end, meaning they can't reach the postsynaptic area. But in reality, neurotransmitters are inside the axon and leave through various channels. So maybe C isn't correct. Alternatively, the lack of receptors on the axons might prevent neurotransmitters from entering, but that's not stated in the options. \n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is G. Because in some cases, the postsynaptic dends have their own structures that pump neurotransmitters back, allowing bidirectional communication. But the question says they're always going forward, so G might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but I thought E said terminals don't release. Since the terminals can't release, neurotransmitters can't get in, which would prevent any movement. But the problem says they do move, so E is incorrect. \n\nAnother possibility is that the postsynaptic cells have certain mechanisms to ensure they receive neurotransmitters and not send them back. For example, the postsynaptic dends might have ion channels that allow them to receive neurotransmitters but block them from leaving. If the axon terminals have ion channels that send neurotransmitters, but the dends block them, that would make the movement unidirectional. Looking at the options, none mention ion channels specifically. However, option G talks about active transport, which could involve pumping. Option H is similar. \n\nBut the question asks why the movement is unidirectional, not necessarily about the mechanics behind it. So perhaps the best fit is option G, as it explains that the postsynaptic regions pump the neurotransmitters back, maintaining the directionality. But earlier reasoning suggested that G might not directly address the direction. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that contradicts the problem statement. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to recall. In many neural pathways, the action potential depolarizes the membrane, causing the release of neurotransmitters. Once inside the postsynaptic cell, they can either stay there (like GABA) or undergo ionotropic or metabotropic receptor currents, which allow them to return. If the postsynaptic cells have these pumps, the neurotransmitters can't flow back, keeping the connection unidirectional. But the question is about why the movement is always forward, not about the maintenance of it. \n\nGiven the options, I think the most plausible answer is E, but that contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the given options, the closest is G. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the correct answer is E, but I'm confused now.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Alternatively, maybe option F is incorrect because degradation isn't happening. So, considering all, the most plausible answer is that the action potential in the presynaptic axon drives the release, and the postsynaptic neurons require the presence of neurotransmitters.

Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's unlikely. Option J says neurotransmitters can travel both ways. Again, contradicts the given fact. So, looking back, I think option G is relevant because it explains the mechanism behind why they move forward, but the question is asking why it happens, not what it does. However, among the options provided, none perfectly fit except perhaps G, as it relates to the structure causing the movement. Alternatively, maybe another option captures the reason better.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why neurotransmitters only go from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite instead of the other way around. Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's probably not correct. Option J says they can go both ways. Again, contradicts the given fact. So now I'm left between options C and H. Since the movement is unidirectional, neither should happen naturally. Maybe C implies they don't accumulate as much in the axon, so they don't keep moving. Alternatively, H's explanation fits because if the movement is bidirectional, it would cause problems. So perhaps the correct answer is C because without accumulation, neurotransmitters don't continuously travel.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I can rule that out. Option J suggests that neurotransmitters can travel both ways. Again, the problem states it's only one direction, so J is incorrect. Now, looking back, the correct answer should relate to the structure of the axon terminal. Since neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first, perhaps the axonal terminal has receptors that release them. But wait, the options don't mention receptors. Instead, option C talks about the neurotransmitter being present in the axonal end. If that's the case, then why does it go forward? Because the vesicles must get into the cell first, and once in, they're part of the signal. So maybe C is the right choice because without the neurotransmitter being there, it wouldn't carry on. Alternatively, thinking about how vesicles form: they are formed in the axon depending on the activity of the axon terminals. If the axon terminals are inactive, no vesicles are formed, so neurotransmitters can't enter. So the presence of neurotransmitters in the axon end (option C) allows vesicles to form and transmit the signal. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I is unlikely. Option J says neurotransmitters can travel both ways. Again, contradicts the given information. So looking back, perhaps the correct answer is about the release process. If neurotransmitters aren't released from the axon (since they're sent to the postsynaptic area), then their release should happen elsewhere. Maybe they're released from the dendrites themselves. Wait, but the question is why they don't go back. So maybe the action potential causes a change in ion channels that allow the vesicles to exit, or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the release sites are different. Since the options are letters, I think the best fit is E, but wait, E says axonal terminals don't release. But the neurotransmitters are being sent to postsynaptic areas, so they must be released from somewhere else. If the terminals don't release, then neurotransmitters wouldn't get in, which contradicts the observation. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to the release mechanism, which is not directly addressed in the options as clearly as others. However, considering all, perhaps the most plausible is that the terminals lack the necessary machinery to release neurotransmitters, making E incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the terminals have ion channels that allow ions to flow in reverse, but I'm not certain. Given the options, the closest reasoning aligns with E, even though it's the opposite of what happens.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. Option J says neurotransmitters can go both ways. Again, this contradicts the given scenario where they only go one way. \n\nWait, let me think again. The key here is how neurotransmitters are released. In most cases, neurotransmitters are secreted by neurons into their cytoplasm, and this happens through mechanisms like voltage-gated ion channels. These release processes typically occur on the axon terminal surface, specifically at the presynaptic regions. So if the axon terminals didn't have the machinery to release neurotransmitters (option E), neurotransmitters wouldn't enter the neuron, making the observation impossible. Therefore, E must be correct because without release, neurotransmitters wouldn't enter the cell. Also, if the axon terminals didn't release them, neurotransmitters couldn't cross to the postsynaptic area. So E is the reason behind the unidirectional movement.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why neurotransmitters only go from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite instead of the other way around. Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's incorrect. Option J says they can travel both ways. As discussed earlier, this contradicts the problem statement, making J incorrect. \n\nNow, focusing back on the options, the key point is that the neurotransmitters aren't staying in the axon long enough to send them to the next cell. So looking at options C and G again, C says they're only in the axonal end, which would mean they don't last long enough. G says they're pumped back, which also affects their duration.

Another thought: sometimes neurotransmitters are stored in the axon as vesicles, which are transported to the postsynaptic area. If they can't be released, they'd never leave the axon. So E might be explaining why they aren't able to travel, but the question says they do. Therefore, perhaps none of these options directly explain why they only go one way. Wait, maybe I missed an option. Let me check again. Oh, option F says they degrade immediately, but the question states they're always being transmitted. So F is incorrect. Option G talks about pumping back, but the movement is unidirectional, so G explains why but not the mechanism. Option H is about the mechanism, but the question asks why, not what. So perhaps the best fit is E, but I'm still unsure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but I think the intended answer is E because it explains why the terminal can't release, preventing neurotransmitters from leaving the axon, hence they don't reach the postsynaptic area.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A.

Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's not correct. Option J says neurotransmitters can travel both ways. But the problem specifies they only go one way, so J is wrong. \n\nNow, looking again, the key point is that neurotransmitters aren't staying in the same cell long enough to send back. So option G's reasoning fits here because if the axon terminals can't pump them back, neurotransmitters would keep moving forward. Therefore, the correct answer should relate to the lack of pumping ability.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

If they were only in the axon, they wouldn't get into the postsynaptic area. But the issue here is that they should be moving from the presynaptic area (which includes the axon) to the postsynaptic area. So if they're only in the axon end, they wouldn't reach the postsynaptic part unless somehow they're retained, which is unlikely.

If axonal terminals can't release neurotransmitters, then neurotransmitters wouldn't enter the cell, making their transmission impossible. But the question says it happens, so E is likely incorrect.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why neurotransmitters only go from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite instead of the other way around. Let's break down each option one by one. First, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A. Option B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either. Option C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet. Option D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later. Option E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect. Option F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong. Option G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward. Option H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question. Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's not correct. Option J says neurotransmitters can go both ways. Again, contradicts the given scenario. So narrowing it down, I think options C and G are contenders. C suggests the neurotransmitter stays in the axon end, making it harder to reach the postsynaptic area. G talks about the trafficking mechanism. Since the question is about why it moves one way, perhaps G explains the reason indirectly. Alternatively, the fact that the neurotransmitter isn't maintained in the axon ends would prevent it from reaching the postsynaptic regions, hence the bidirectional movement (if it were possible) would be prevented. So maybe the correct answer is C, meaning they don't stick around long enough.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " Option J says neurotransmitters can travel both ways. Again, contradicts the given scenario. \n\nWait, let me think again. The key here is why neurotransmitters don't come back. If they could, why aren't they moving that way? Option G talks about active pumping by dendrites. That sounds plausible because if the axon terminals can't release neurotransmitters, maybe the dendrites maintain them by pumping them back. But since the movement is unidirectional as per the question, perhaps G is explaining why it doesn't go backward. Alternatively, if the question is asking why it's going one way, G could be a reason for why it's going the other way (like why it doesn't go back). Hmm, confusing.\n\nAnother angle: Synaptic transmission often involves voltage-gated ion channels that allow neurotransmitters to enter when there's a depolarization signal. If the axon terminals can't release them, perhaps the neurotransmitters accumulate and then leave through ion channels. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the movement is controlled by the presence of certain ions or proteins that facilitate the transfer. For example, if the axon terminals lack the necessary enzymes to release neurotransmitters, and the postsynaptic cells require specific ions or structures to receive them, then the neurotransmitters would only move in one direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking back, option G says the dendrites actively pump neurotransmitters back to the axon. If that were true, neurotransmitters would flow both ways, contradicting the observation. So if the movement is unidirectional, maybe the ability of the axon terminals to release neurotransmitters isn't sufficient, and the postsynaptic cells somehow maintain them without coming back. Or perhaps the postsynaptic cells pump them back, making it unidirectional. But the question is specifically about why it goes one way, not necessarily maintaining it.\n\nMaybe the correct answer is G because it explains why the movement isn't the other way, but that doesn't directly answer why it's happening. Alternatively, thinking about the function of ion channels, if the axon terminals can't release neurotransmitters, perhaps the postsynaptic cells use their own mechanisms to keep them, like pumping them back, but that doesn't fit the options.\n\nOption C: Neurons have neurotransmitters only in the axon ends. That doesn't seem right because neurotransmitters typically stay inside the cell until they're sent out. So if they're only in the axon ends, they wouldn't reach the postsynaptic area. Unless the question is about something else, like storage, but that's not the point here.\n\nOption E: Axon terminals can't release neurotransmitters. But the question says neurotransmitters are always transmitted, so if they couldn't be released, they wouldn't enter the cell, which is contradictory.\n\nSo putting it all together, the most plausible explanation is that the postsynaptic cells pump neurotransmitters back to the axon, keeping them away from the axon terminals. That would explain why neurotransmitters don't just flow back. But looking at the options, none mention this. Instead, option G talks about the postsynaptic cells pumping them back. Since the movement is unidirectional, perhaps the postsynaptic cells maintain them via this mechanism. Therefore, the correct answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",
