Problem: It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.\n\nA. Neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals traveling towards the dendrites only.\n\nB. The receptors for neurotransmitters are only found on the axonal terminals.\n\nC. The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only.\n\nD. The synaptic vesicle is present inside the dendrites of a neuron.\n\nE. The axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters.\n\nF. The neurotransmitter degrades immediately upon release and cannot travel to the axon.\n\nG. The dendrites actively pump the neurotransmitter back to the axon after it has been received.\n\nH. The neurotransmitter is present in the dendritic end of a neuron only.\n\nI. The dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates the effect of the axonal neurotransmitter.\n\nJ. The neurotransmitter can travel in both directions.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why neurotransmitters only go from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite instead of the other way around. Let's break down each option one by one.\n\nFirst, option A says that neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals moving towards the dendrites. Hmm, if that were true, then maybe neurotransmitters would be released more quickly onto the postsynaptic side. But the problem states they're always going the opposite way, so probably not A.\n\nOption B suggests receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no, because the neurotransmitters have to enter the cell first. So if there were no receptors on axons, neurotransmitters wouldn't get in. But the question says they always go from axon to dendrite, implying that the axon must have some receptors or something else that releases them. So B might not be right either.\n\nOption C claims the neurotransmitter is only in the axonal end. That doesn't make much sense because neurotransmitters usually stay within the axon until they're sent to the next cell. If they're only in the axon end, how would they reach the postsynaptic area? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. Perhaps it means they don't stick around long enough. Not sure yet.\n\nOption D says the synaptic vesicles are inside the dendrites. Wait, no, the vesicles come from the axon inside the synaptic Vesicles. So if they were inside the dendrites, that would complicate things. Maybe that's relevant later.\n\nOption E is about axonal terminals not releasing neurotransmitters. If they couldn't release them, neurotransmitters wouldn't even get into the cell, which contradicts the observation. So E seems incorrect.\n\nOption F says neurotransmitters degrade immediately. But the problem states they're always being transmitted, not degraded. So F is likely wrong.\n\nOption G mentions dendrites pumping neurotransmitters back. But the question says they move forward, so G might explain why, but isn't directly answering why it moves forward.\n\nOption H suggests dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. This makes sense if the movement was bidirectional, but the problem says it's unidirectional. So H explains why it goes forward but doesn't address the question.\n\nOption I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. If that happened, neurotransmitters could go both ways, which contradicts the observation. So I's probably incorrect.\n\nOption J says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter, which negates the effect. Again, this would allow bidirectional movement, so J is likely incorrect as well.\n\nSo narrowing it down, options C and G seem related. Option C suggests neurotransmitters aren't in the axonal end, while G talks about their movement. Since the question is about why they go from axon to dendrite, I think option C is pointing to something like \"the axon terminal doesn't release neurotransmitters,\" making them stay longer in the axon before exiting.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
