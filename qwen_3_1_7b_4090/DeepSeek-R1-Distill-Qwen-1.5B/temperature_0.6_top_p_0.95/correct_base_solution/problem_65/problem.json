  "problem": "It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.\n\nA. Neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals traveling towards the dendrites only.\n\nB. The receptors for neurotransmitters are only found on the axonal terminals.\n\nC. The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only.\n\nD. The synaptic vesicle is present inside the dendrites of a neuron.\n\nE. The axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters.\n\nF. The neurotransmitter degrades immediately upon release and cannot travel to the axon.\n\nG. The dendrites actively pump the neurotransmitter back to the axon after it has been received.\n\nH. The neurotransmitter is present in the dendritic end of a neuron only.\n\nI. The dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates the effect of the axonal neurotransmitter.\n\nJ. The neurotransmitter can travel in both directions.",
