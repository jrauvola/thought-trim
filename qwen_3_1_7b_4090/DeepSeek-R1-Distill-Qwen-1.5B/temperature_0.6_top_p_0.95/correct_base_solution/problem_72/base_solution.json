  "solution": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let's start by breaking down what each term means.\n\nMutation refers to changes in DNA that can cause variations or defects. Recombination is when genetic material is exchanged between two organisms, leading to new combinations. Both are important in immune system processes because they can introduce new proteins or modify existing ones.\n\nT-cells are part of the immune system, specifically the T-lymphocytes. They help fight infections like HIV. When a T-cell is exposed to an antigen (a foreign substance), it can either activate or deactivate. If it doesn't react, it might lead to the destruction of the entire cell or the production of more T-cells, which could be harmful if the cell isn't supposed to be there.\n\nNow, tissue graft rejection happens when a patient's body rejects a donor's tissue after\u79fb\u690d. This often relates to the immune system rejecting the foreign tissue. So, I'm thinking about how mutations and recombination affect the T-cells' ability to recognize foreign antigens.\n\nOption A says mutations and recombination only happen in B-cells, but that seems off because the question is about T-cells. Also, it doesn't mention anything about T-cell mediated rejection.\n\nOption B talks about mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds promising. The thymus is where T-cells mature, and mutations there can change their receptors. If these mutated T-cells then encounter foreign antigens, they might activate or recognize them, leading to rejection.\n\nOption C claims mutations prevent T-cells from recognizing foreign antigens. While mutations do affect T-cells, they don't prevent them from recognizing; instead, they alter their responses. So C is incorrect.\n\nOptions D through H relate to repair or other immune responses, but they don't directly address how mutations and recombination contribute to rejection.\n\nSo putting it together, the correct answer should be B because it correctly states that during T-cell maturation in the thymus, mutations and recombination lead to T-cells that recognize foreign antigens, causing T-cell mediated rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",
