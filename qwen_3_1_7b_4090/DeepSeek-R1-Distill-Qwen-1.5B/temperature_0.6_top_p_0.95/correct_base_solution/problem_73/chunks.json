Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about probability involving a deck of playing cards. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says: \"A deck of playing cards is thoroughly shuffled and a card is drawn from the deck. What is the probability that the card drawn is the ace of diamonds?\" Then there are several options provided, labeled A through J.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but they usually follow a straightforward approach once you figure out what exactly is being asked.\n\nSo, we're dealing with a standard deck of playing cards. I remember that a standard deck has 52 cards. These are divided into four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards: numbers 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. So, in total, 4 suits \u00d7 13 cards = 52 cards.\n\nNow, the deck is thoroughly shuffled, which means all the cards are mixed up randomly. When you draw one card from the shuffled deck, each card has an equal chance of being selected. That makes sense because if it wasn't shuffled perfectly, some cards might favor certain draws over others, but since it's thoroughly shuffled, each card is equally likely.\n\nThe specific card we're interested in is the ace of diamonds. Since the deck is shuffled, every card has an equal probability of being the first card drawn or any other position in the deck. So, when we draw one card, the chance of picking the ace of diamonds should be based on how many favorable outcomes there are compared to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible outcomes here. Since there are 52 unique cards in the deck, the total number of possible outcomes when drawing one card is 52. This includes all possible positions where the ace of diamonds could be found in the deck.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes\u2014those that result in our desired outcome\u2014the ace of diamonds is just one specific card. So, there's only 1 favorable outcome.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing the ace of diamonds is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes. In mathematical terms, that would be:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 1 (ace of diamonds) / 52 (total cards)\n= 1/52\n\nHmm, wait a second. Let me double-check that. Is there another way to think about this? For example, does the shuffling affect anything else besides the order of the cards? Well, no, because the shuffle ensures that every card is equally likely to be anywhere in the deck. There's no bias towards any particular card being drawn before or after another.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the fact that we're looking at a specific card, regardless of its position, the probability remains the same as long as the deck isn't changed in any way between shuffling and drawing. Since the deck is thoroughly shuffled, the initial shuffle doesn't influence the subsequent drawing\u2014it's random.\n\nAnother point to consider is whether the ace of diamonds is considered a special card or something like that. But in probability terms, even the most common or obscure card like ace of diamonds has an equal chance of being picked as any other card.\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014is the ace of diamonds the only ace in the deck? Yes, because each suit has an ace, and there are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. So, the ace of diamonds is indeed one of the four aces in the deck.\n\nBut does that matter for calculating the probability? No, because we're focusing solely on the ace of diamonds itself, not the distribution of aces across the deck. The fact that there are four aces in total doesn't change the probability of drawing any specific one, including the ace of diamonds.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the probability is 1 divided by 52, which simplifies to 1/52. Looking back at the answer choices, option H is 1/52, so that must be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me go through the options again:\n\nA. 1/53 \u2013 That would be if there were 53 cards instead of 52, maybe adding a joker or something.\nB. 3/52 \u2013 Hmm, why would there be three? Maybe considering some face cards or something?\nC. 2/51 \u2013 Wait, 2 over 51? How did that come about? If someone thought there were two aces left and 51 cards, but actually, there are four aces, so that seems off.\nD. 2/52 \u2013 That's also 1/26, similar to option I, but without the factor of 2. Why would there be a 2 in the numerator? It doesn't seem right unless someone is considering multiple aces, but in reality, there are four aces, not two.\nE. 4/52 \u2013 Which simplifies to 1/13. That would be the probability of drawing any ace, not specifically the ace of diamonds. Since there are four aces, multiplying 1/52 by 4 gives us 4/52, so E is incorrect.\nF. 1/50 \u2013 Similar reasoning to A, probably counting a joker in the deck.\nG. 1/13 \u2013 Again, thinking about four aces leading to 4/52, which reduces to 1/13, but that's the probability for any ace, not the specific ace of diamonds.\nH. 1/52 \u2013 As I calculated earlier, this is the correct probability for drawing the ace of diamonds from a 52-card deck.\nI. 1/26 \u2013 Same logic as D, perhaps dividing by 2 mistakenly.\nJ. 1/51 \u2013 This would imply there are 51 cards in the deck, possibly removing one card, but the original deck is 52 cards.\nK. F. \u2013 Probably a typo.\nL. G. \u2013 Another typo.\nM. H. \u2013 Another typo.\nN. I. \u2013 Another typo.\nO. J. \u2013 Another typo.\n\nSo, after reviewing all the options, H is clearly the correct answer. None of the other options correctly represent the probability of drawing the ace of diamonds from a standard 52-card deck.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",
