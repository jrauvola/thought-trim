    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is about -60 mV, but our starting point was +50 mV, so it's not resting anymore. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but the question isn't asking about multiple states\u2014it's about the type of change. - **G. depolarization**: That's increasing positive charge.

It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain.

So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70 mV, which is lower than resting, so it's not the resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: I'm not entirely sure about this term, but it doesn't seem directly related to the change described.\n- **G. depolarization**: This is increasing the positive charge on the membrane. The membrane potential decreased, so it's not depolarization.\n- **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, and I don't recall this being relevant here.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to the inability to fire again during a refractory period after an action potential, but we saw a significant drop, so it's not the refractory period.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards the resting potential. However, in this case, the membrane potential didn't return to resting\u2014it went further into the negatives. So, repolarization isn't accurate because it implies returning to rest.\n\nPutting it all together: The membrane potential went from a positive to a very negative value, indicating hyperpolarization.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV, but our final potential is -70 mV, which is deeper than resting. So it's not the resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potentials could imply varying states, but without more context, it's unclear. However, the question seems to focus on specific types rather than gradual changes. - **G. depolarization**: That's increasing positive charge. Our case starts high and ends lower, so not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar, but probably not relevant here.\n- **I. refractory period**: Not directly related to membrane potential changes.\n- **J. repolarization**: That's decreasing back towards the resting potential. Our case started high and ended low, so no repolarization.\n- **K. none of the above**: But since B is correct, K isn't applicable.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, hyperpolarization. Wait, but sometimes I get confused between hyperpolarization and depolarization. Depolarization increases the potential, while hyperpolarization makes it more negative. In this case, the membrane potential goes from +50 to -70, so it's definitely becoming more negative, hence hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells.

If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential.

However, since it's already gone, maybe \"departsion.\" But none of the options mention \"depolarization.\" Wait, option G is \"depolarization,\" which fits because the membrane potential moved from positive to negative. Option B is \"hyperpolarization,\" which also fits as the membrane potential became more negative. Hmm, but both could be correct depending on interpretation. Let me check the definitions again. Depolarization is increasing positive charge, leading to depolarization. Hyperpolarization is becoming more negative, i.e., moving towards a lower potential. Both could describe the same scenario but in opposite directions. However, the question is asking what the change represents, and the options include both. But wait, in the context of neuron responses, when a neuron receives a signal, it depolarizes (becomes less negative), which is a common response. But in this case, the membrane potential is changing from +50 to -70, which is a more extreme hyperpolarization. So, the best fit among the options is \"hyperpolarization.\" But I'm a bit confused because \"departsion\" isn't listed.

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is -60 mV. Our final potential is -70, which is more negative. So it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply multiple states, but the question seems to present a continuous change rather than multiple states. Maybe not. - **G. depolarization**: Yes, because the membrane potential decreased from positive to very negative.\n- **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term in this context.\n- **I. refractory period**: This is about not firing again during a period, not directly related.\n- **J. repolarization**: Repolarization is decreasing back toward resting potential. Here, it went beyond, so it's not repolarization.\n- **K. rest**: No, because it's showing a change.\n- **L. gradation**: Not matching any option.\n\nWait, but looking back, the question asks what the change represents. From +50 to -70, which is a significant drop. So, does \"hyperpolarization\" apply? Because hyperpolarization means moving further into the negative. Alternatively, \"repolarization\" would involve returning, but here it's gone. Also, \"threshold\" isn't applicable unless it reached a point where another ion starts flowing. However, since it's already gone, maybe \"departsion.\" But none of the options mention \"depolarization.\" Wait, option G is \"depolarization,\" which fits because the membrane potential moved from positive to negative. Option B is \"hyperpolarization,\" which also fits as the membrane potential became more negative. Hmm, but both could be correct depending on interpretation. Let me check the definitions again. Depolarization is increasing positive charge, leading to depolarization. Hyperpolarization is becoming more negative, i.e., moving towards a lower potential. Both could describe the same scenario but in opposite directions. However, the question is asking what the change represents, and the options include both. But wait, in the context of neuron responses, when a neuron receives a signal, it depolarizes (becomes less negative), which is a common response. But in this case, the membrane potential is changing from +50 to -70, which is a more extreme hyperpolarization. So, the best fit among the options is \"hyperpolarization.\" But I'm a bit confused because \"departsion\" isn't listed. Alternatively, \"repolarization\" would require returning, which isn't happening. So, the answer should be \"hyperpolarization.\"\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium.",

    "rollout": " - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV.

Not exactly graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in membrane potential. From +50 to -70 is a significant decrease, so this isn't depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't recall this being directly relevant here.\n- **I. refractory period**: As mentioned earlier, this relates to inability to fire once an action potential occurs.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is the decrease back towards resting potential after an action potential.

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final potential is -70, which is lower, so it's not resting anymore. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but the question seems to focus on specific transitions rather than varying states. - **G. depolarization**: No, because it's moving into the negative direction. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this; maybe it's not relevant here. - **I. refractory period**: This is a time frame during which the neuron can't fire again, but our case doesn't involve firing. - **J. repolarization**: This would be when the membrane potential returns to a higher value than its resting potential, but here it's moving into a deeper negative. - **K. none of these**: Maybe, but let's see.\n\nSo, putting it together, the membrane potential decreased from +50 to -70. That means it became more negative, which is characteristic of hyperpolarization. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70 mV, which is lower, so it's not the resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying levels, but our change isn't graded\u2014it's a specific transition. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge, which doesn't match since the membrane potential decreased. - **H. synapse potential**: Maybe referring to synaptic potential? Synaptic potential is the change in membrane potential following a neurotransmitter release. It could be either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. In this case, it's definitely becoming more negative, so maybe synapse potential is involved, but I'm not entirely sure. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire again after a certain period, not directly to membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential. We started at +50 and ended at -70, so it's not a complete return. - **K. rest**: No, because the membrane potential did change. - **L. none of the above**: Well, G, H, and others seem possible.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The starting point is +50, ending at -70. So, initial was high positive, then deep negative. So, the membrane potential went through a significant decrease. That's definitely hyperpolarization because it's moving away from rest (which is -60) into more negative values. Action potential requires a rise, so J is out. Repolarization is going back up, which is not happening here. Threshold potential is when enough ions flow to allow conduction of an action potential. But without knowing the ion gates' states, I can't say for sure whether the membrane reached that point. However, the question is asking about the term used, not whether the condition was met. Similarly, equilibrium potential implies no net flow, which isn't the case here. Graded potential just means varying levels, which also doesn't fit. Depolarization is increasing positive, which isn't the case. So, B seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV, but our initial potential was +50, so it wasn't resting. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but we started at +50 and ended at -70, which is a significant change. - **G. depolarization**: That's increasing positive charge, which doesn't fit because the potential went negative. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this one either. - **I. refractory period**: This is about time intervals where neurons can't fire, not directly related to the change in membrane potential. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential. Our case is moving away, so repolarization isn't right. - **K. repolarization** vs **L. repolarization again**: Wait, maybe K is correct? Or did I miss something else. Wait, let's go back. The membrane potential decreased from +50 to -70, so it's getting more negative, which is hyperpolarization. Option B is correct. But wait, option J is repolarization, which is decreasing back up. So why is option G, depolarization, not applicable? Because depolarization is increasing positive charge, which is not happening here. So, the answer should be B, hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them.

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV, but our initial value was +50, so it's not the resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potentials refer to varying levels of membrane potential, but without specific details on the exact values, it's too vague. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge, which doesn't fit because our potential decreased. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term. - **I. refractory period**: This is about inability to fire again, not directly related to the membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential, but in this case, it went further negative, so it's not repolarization. - **K. repolarization**: Wait, maybe I misread. No, J is correct as it's decreasing back, but since it went further, K isn't right. - **L. None of these**: Maybe, but let's see. So, B seems correct because it's moving from +50 to -70, which is becoming more negative. C is an action potential, which requires depolarization, but we have a decrease. F could be \"graded\", but without specifics, it's unclear. H is synapse potential, which I don't know. G is depolarization, which isn't applicable. E is resting, which isn't. So, B and F are possibilities. Between B and F: B is hyperpolarization, which fits the description of becoming more negative. F is a graded potential, but without knowing the exact values, it's less precise.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV, but our initial condition was +50 mV, not resting.

It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our initial value was +50, so it's not the resting potential itself. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but the question is about a specific change, not about being on different levels. - **G. depolarization**: That's increasing positive charge, so our case is decreasing, hence not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't recall anything about synapse potentials directly affecting membrane potential in this context. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire due to past firing, but again, not directly relevant here. - **J. repolarization**: Repolarization is returning to the resting potential from a depolarized state. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, so it's already been depolarized beyond the resting level, not just returning. - **K. none of the above**: Well, since B seems correct, maybe K isn't necessary.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The membrane potential starts at +50 mV and ends at -70 mV. So, it went from a positive to a very negative number. What does that signify? Hyperpolarization because it's moving away from rest. Also, considering the options, J is repolarization, which doesn't fit because it's too far. So, the answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.

    "rollout": " - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is typically around -60 mV, but our initial value was +50, which isn't exactly at rest. However, the final value is -70, which is lower than resting, indicating depolarization rather than rest. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but the question shows a clear transition to a very negative value. - **G. depolarization**: Yes, because the membrane potential decreased from +50 to -70.\n- **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall a synapse being directly involved in changing the membrane potential in this context.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire after an action potential, not the potential itself.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential recovers back towards its resting state. Our case showed a significant drop, not a recovery.\n- **K. a. Repolarization**: Wait, J and K both say repolarization, but J is more general, while K is specific. Since the membrane potential went from high positive to very negative, it's definitely repolarization.\n\nNow, looking back, B and G both seem correct. Let me check the definitions again. Hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential, which fits here. Depolarization is when it increases. Both B and G fit. But wait, the question asks which term best describes the change. Since the potential went from a positive to a much more negative value, it's a steep decrease, which is characteristic of depolarization. So maybe G is the better choice. Alternatively, hyperpolarization is also correct since it's moving away from rest. Hmm, I need to decide based on the wording. \"Considered\" implies a type of event that leads to this change. Both B and G describe events, but hyperpolarization specifically refers to becoming more negative than resting, while depolarization is increasing positivity. In this case, the membrane potential decreased significantly, which aligns with both events. But I think G is more accurate as it's about becoming more negative relative to resting potential. Alternatively, sometimes depolarization is used interchangeably with becoming less negative. Maybe I should go with G because it specifies the result of the change.\n\nWait, another thought: When a neuron is resting, its membrane potential is at a resting potential, which is around -60 mV. If the membrane potential becomes more negative, it's called hyperpolarization. So from +50 to -70 is a significant shift toward hyperpolarity.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is typically around -60 mV, but our initial value was +50, which isn't exactly at rest. However, the final value is -70, which is lower than resting, indicating depolarization rather than rest. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but the question shows a clear transition to a very negative value. - **G. depolarization**: Yes, because the membrane potential decreased from +50 to -70.\n- **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall a synapse being directly involved in changing the membrane potential in this context.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire after an action potential, not the potential itself.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential recovers back towards its resting state. Our case showed a significant drop, not a recovery.\n- **K. a. Repolarization**: Wait, J and K both say repolarization, but J is more general, while K is specific. Since the membrane potential went from high positive to very negative, it's definitely repolarization.\n\nNow, looking back, B and G both seem correct. Let me check the definitions again. Hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential, which fits here. Depolarization is when it increases. Both B and G fit. But wait, the question asks which term best describes the change. Since the potential went from a positive to a much more negative value, it's a steep decrease, which is characteristic of depolarization. So maybe G is the better choice. Alternatively, hyperpolarization is also correct since it's moving away from rest. Hmm, I need to decide based on the wording. \"Considered\" implies a type of event that leads to this change. Both B and G describe events, but hyperpolarization specifically refers to becoming more negative than resting, while depolarization is increasing positivity. In this case, the membrane potential decreased significantly, which aligns with both events. But I think G is more accurate as it's about becoming more negative relative to resting potential. Alternatively, sometimes depolarization is used interchangeably with becoming less negative. Maybe I should go with G because it specifies the result of the change.\n\nWait, another thought: When a neuron is resting, its membrane potential is at a resting potential, which is around -60 mV. If the membrane potential becomes more negative, it's called hyperpolarization. So from +50 to -70 is a significant shift toward hyperpolarity. Therefore, G is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium.",

    "rollout": " - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is -60 mV, and our final value is -70, which is deeper into the negative. So it's not resting. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but without specific events, it's unclear. - **G. depolarization**: That's increasing positive charge, which doesn't match the scenario. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this. - **I. refractory period**: This is about periods where the cell cannot fire again. Not directly related. - **J. repolarization**: That's decreasing back towards resting. Yes, since the membrane potential decreased, it's repolarization. Wait, but earlier I thought hyperpolarization was correct because it's becoming more negative. Hmm, maybe I should double-check. Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards resting, while hyperpolarization is going further into the negative. So both J and B seem possible. Wait, looking back, the initial change is from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop. So hyperpolarization is a result of this, whereas repolarization is the process returning to rest. The question asks what the change represents. It starts as +50 and ends as -70. So during the process, the membrane potential went from being less positive to more negative. At any point during this, the membrane potential is becoming more negative, hence hyperpolarization. Alternatively, when the membrane potential reaches a certain level, say -60, it would become an equilibrium potential. Wait, but the question isn't asking about the result, but what type of potential the change represents. The transition from +50 to -70 is a decrease, so the membrane potential became more negative, which is hyperpolarization. However, sometimes \"hyperpolarization\" refers to the state itself rather than the process. Maybe I should consider both possibilities. Alternatively, repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back toward resting. So depending on whether you're considering the entire process or just the end result, it could be either. But the question states the membrane potential changes from +50 to -70, which suggests it's moving towards a more negative state. So hyperpolarization is the result, while repolarization is the reversal. Therefore, the answer might be B or J. Wait, but the options don't include both. Let me check the original options again. The user provided a list up to H and I, including J. So the options are:\n\nA. threshold potential  \nB. hyperpolarization  \nC. action potential  \nD. equilibrium potential  \nE. resting potential  \nF. graded potential  \nG. depolarization  \nH. synapse potential  \nI. repolarization  \nJ. repolarization  \n\nWait, I see I made a mistake earlier. The question is about the change itself, not the result. So starting from +50 to -70, the membrane potential has gone from being low positive to very negative. So the term describing this change is the progression from high positive to more negative. Now, looking back, \"departs\" would relate to depolarization. But none of the options mention depolarization except option G. Option J is repolarization, which is the reverse. So which is it? The change is a decrease, so the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So it's moving towards hyperpolarization. Alternatively, when it reaches a certain level, it might become equilibrium. Wait, equilibrium would require no net movement, but in this case, it did move. So maybe it's hyperpolarization because it's becoming more negative than the resting potential. Or is it repolarization because it's decreasing back towards resting? The question isn't specifying the endpoint, just the change. So perhaps the best fit is repolarization because it's decreasing, but sometimes hyperpolarization is used interchangeably. Alternatively, thinking about the definitions: hyperpolarization is becoming more negative than resting, which matches our scenario. Repolarization is the reverse. So the answer depends on whether we're talking about the current state or the process. But the question is about the change itself. So the process of decreasing from +50 to -70 is called depolarization, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the state of having reached a more negative potential is hyperpolarization. But the options don't have \"more negative.\" So between B and I. Since the question is about the change, the term would be the progression, which is depolarization, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the term that describes the direction is depolarization, but it's not listed. So perhaps the closest is hyperpolarization, as the membrane potential is becoming more negative than the resting potential.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the term \"repolarization\" refers to returning to a resting membrane potential, which is the opposite of hyperpolarization. In this case, the membrane potential is becoming more negative, so it's hyperpolarization. Therefore, the answer is B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is about -60 mV, but the initial value was +50 mV, so it's not the resting potential itself.\n- **F. graded potential**: Graded might imply varying potentials, but again, the change isn't about varying; it's about moving to a more negative value. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing the positive charge, which isn't happening here since the potential decreased. - **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall synapses being directly related to these terms. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire, not membrane potential. - **J. repolarization**: Repolarization is decreasing back towards resting potential. The question didn't mention returning to rest, just going to -70. - **K. repolarization** isn't exactly correct either. So, based on this analysis, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. hyperpolarization because the membrane potential moved beyond the resting potential into a more negative state.\n\nWait, but the question starts at +50 mV, goes to -70 mV. That's a big move from positive to very negative. So, maybe it's also a decrease in potential, but does that make it hyperpolarization? Yes, because it's becoming more negative relative to the resting potential. Also, hyperpolarization often refers to becoming more negative than the resting state. So, yes, that fits option B.\n\nAnother thought: Could it be J. repolarization? No, because repolarization is about returning to rest potential, whereas this is moving away from it. So, repolarization wouldn't apply here. So, my final conclusion is B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.

In this case, since the question describes the result of a change (from +50 to -70), the specific term would be hyperpolarization because it's moving further into negativity relative to resting. Alternatively, repolarization could also apply if the potential had been higher than resting before dropping. But in the question, it's just the result of a change from a higher positive to a much more negative value. So maybe both B and J are applicable? Wait, looking back, the user provided options as single letters, implying only one correct answer. Let me check the exact wording. The question says: \"A change in a neuron membrane potential from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts is considered...\" So the change is from +50 to -70. What does this represent? It's a significant decrease in membrane potential, going from a high positive to a very low negative. So, the term for the change is hyperpolarization because it's becoming more negative than the resting potential. Therefore, option B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV, but our final potential is -70, which is more depolarized. So E isn't correct either. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but again, the membrane potential is changing, so F doesn't fit. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge, which isn't happening here. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, but the term seems unclear. Maybe irrelevant here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire due to past activity, not directly about the membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential.

Let me see the definitions again. Hyperpolarization is when you go beyond the resting potential, which is -60. So starting at +50, ending at -70, definitely hyperpolarized. Repolarization is the reverse. So both B and J seem applicable. Wait, the question asks what the change represents. From +50 to -70, so it's becoming more negative. So both B and J describe parts of the same process. But the options don't combine. So I need to pick the best fit. Since the question states \"is considered,\" it's asking what type of change it is. Repolarization is a general term for decreasing back to resting. Hyperpolarization is specifically going beyond rest. So depending on context, either could apply. However, the term used for the entire process is action potential leading to hyperpolarization followed by repolarization. So the specific change described here is hyperpolarization. Alternatively, the entire event is called an action potential, but the change itself is hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question says the change is considered, so the term should describe the change. So J, repolarization, describes the final phase.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV, and our initial value was higher (+50), so it's not resting. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but again, the question doesn't specify varying, just a change. - **G. depolarization**: That's increasing positive charge. Our case is decreasing, so no. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar enough. - **I. refractory period**: This is about inability to fire, not about potential change. - **J. repolarization**: Decreasing back towards resting potential. Yes, since it started at +50 and ended at -70, it's definitely repolarization.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases toward resting potential after an action potential. In this case, yes, it's moving towards -60 mV, so J seems correct. Also, looking at B, hyperpolarization, which also fits because the potential became very negative. Hmm, maybe both B and J fit? But the options require only one answer.

Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: No, because the membrane potential isn't returning to its resting state; it's moving away. - **F. graded potential**: Maybe, as it's a range rather than a specific value. But I'm not sure if that's the correct term. - **G. depolarization**: While the membrane potential did become more positive initially, the overall change was to a more negative value, so it's a decrease in depolarization. But the term itself applies to the general concept of becoming less positive.\n- **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall a synapse potential being a standard term in this context. Synapses are involved in communication, but I don't see how that directly relates to membrane potential changes.\n- **I. refractory period**: This is about time periods where a neuron can't fire, not about the membrane potential changing.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential recovers towards its resting state after depolarization. But in our case, it's going further negative, so it's not just recovering. It's becoming more depolarized.\n\nSo, looking again: The membrane potential starts at +50 mV and ends at -70 mV. The most accurate description is that it has become hyperpolarized because it moved beyond the resting potential (-60 mV). Therefore, option B is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. The final membrane potential is -70 mV, which is lower than resting, so it's not resting anymore. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potential implies varying states, but the question shows a clear change from positive to very negative. Not graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is moving to higher positive values. Our case moves to more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't recall a direct relation to this term here. - **I. refractory period**: This is about a cooldown period during which firing can't occur.

I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium.",

Yes, that's correct because the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, so it's moving back up towards rest. Wait, actually, no. Repolarization would mean returning to the resting potential, but in this case, the membrane potential is moving deeper into negative, away from resting. So J. repolarization isn't accurate. Alternatively, maybe J is incorrect. Wait, let me clarify: When a neuron fires, it depolarizes (goes to higher positive), which sends a signal through the axon. Then, upon receiving a signal, it becomes hyperpolarized (more negative), which resets the axon. So, in this scenario, after firing, the membrane potential becomes more negative, so it's depolarizing? No, wait, depolarization is increasing positive. So in this case, it's becoming more negative, which is depolarizing? Or is it just called a change in hyperpolarization? Hmm, perhaps my earlier thought was right that it's hyperpolarization.\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\n- Initial state: +50 mV (relative to resting?)\n\nWait, hold on. Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -60 mV. So +50 mV relative to resting would be 110 mV resting. That seems high, but possible in some cases.\n\nAfter the change, it's -70 mV, which is 20 mV less than resting.

I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV, but our initial value was +50 mV, which isn't the resting potential. However, after depolarization, it becomes -70 mV, which crosses into the action potential phase. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potentials are different levels, maybe used to describe different states. But the question is asking what type of potential, not how many grades there are. So probably not F. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge, but the membrane potential decreased, so G doesn't apply. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, but without knowing where exactly in the process, this seems vague. - **I. refractory period**: This is the time after firing when another action potential can't occur. But again, the question is about the current state rather than timing. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential. Yes, that's correct because the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, so it's moving back up towards rest. Wait, actually, no. Repolarization would mean returning to the resting potential, but in this case, the membrane potential is moving deeper into negative, away from resting. So J. repolarization isn't accurate. Alternatively, maybe J is incorrect. Wait, let me clarify: When a neuron fires, it depolarizes (goes to higher positive), which sends a signal through the axon. Then, upon receiving a signal, it becomes hyperpolarized (more negative), which resets the axon. So, in this scenario, after firing, the membrane potential becomes more negative, so it's depolarizing? No, wait, depolarization is increasing positive. So in this case, it's becoming more negative, which is depolarizing? Or is it just called a change in hyperpolarization? Hmm, perhaps my earlier thought was right that it's hyperpolarization.\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\n- Initial state: +50 mV (relative to resting?)\n\nWait, hold on. Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -60 mV. So +50 mV relative to resting would be 110 mV resting. That seems high, but possible in some cases.\n\nAfter the change, it's -70 mV, which is 20 mV less than resting. So it's getting even more negative, which is hyperpolarization.\n\nSo the answer should be B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",
