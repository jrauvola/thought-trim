    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential.",

    "rollout": " - **F. graded potential**: I'm not sure, but this could relate to different states. However, the question seems to focus on specific terms rather than a range. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge, moving away from rest. Our case is decreasing, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this one either. Synapses connect neurons, but I don't recall it being a standard term here. - **I. refractory period**: As mentioned earlier, this is about periods where neurons can't fire again, not directly related to potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is the opposite of depolarization; it's when the membrane potential decreases back toward resting. In our case, the membrane potential is becoming more negative, so it's not repolarization. - **K. none of the above**: Maybe, but since B seems correct, K might be appropriate.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The membrane potential starts at +50 and ends at -70. That's a significant decrease into the negative. Hyperpolarization is when it gets more negative than resting. So yes, B fits.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different levels, but again, the question shows a clear transition without indicating multiple grades. - **G. depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential increases. We saw a decrease, so no depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Maybe referring to something else, but I don't recall this being a standard term in this context. - **I. refractory period**: This is about the gap between action potentials, not directly applicable here. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards the resting potential. Yes, our membrane potential decreased, so this fits. - **K. rest**: No, as discussed earlier. - **L. grade**: Not familiar. \n\nSo, looking at B and J: B is hyperpolarization because the membrane potential went from a higher positive to a much lower negative. J is repolarization because the membrane potential returned to a lower positive area. Wait, but the initial change was from +50 to -70, so it's both becoming more negative and also returning to near the resting potential. However, the question asks what is the result of the entire change? It starts at +50 and ends at -70, so it's showing a significant shift toward depolarization.

But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply multiple levels, but the change is significant enough to be called something else. Maybe hyperpolarization is more precise. - **G. depolarization**: Yes, the membrane potential decreased, moving away from rest. So this fits. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't recall this being a standard term here. - **I. refractory period**: This is about not firing during a period, unrelated to the potential change. - **J. repolarization**: Repolarization is returning to the resting state after depolarization. The change went too far, so it's not repolarization. - **K. another option isn't listed**. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check. The question starts at +50 and ends at -70, so it's a big swing into negative. That's definitely hyperpolarization because it's moving further from the resting potential. Also, since it's a significant drop, it's not just a small depolarization. Action potential is wrong because it's a rise, not a fall. Resting potential is too high; our final potential is lower. Depolarization is correct, but hyperpolarization is more accurate. So B seems right.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them.

First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potential could imply different levels, but the change isn't just a gradation; it's a significant shift. - **G. depolarization**: The membrane potential decreased, moving away from resting potential, so yes, depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term. - **I. refractory period**: This is about a period where the neuron can't fire again. There's no indication of a refractory period here. - **J. repolarization**: This is the return of the membrane potential towards its resting state. Since our potential went deeper into the negative, it's not just returning; it's gone further. - **K. all others**: The remaining terms don't fit the scenario.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the correct answer should be B. hyperpolarization because the membrane potential became more negative than the resting potential.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential.",

The initial potential was +50, then it went to -70. So, starting from a high positive, it dipped quite a bit. Hyperpolarization would be when it becomes more negative than the resting potential.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply multiple states, but since the membrane potential decreased, it's a single state now\u2014it\u2019s a steep descent rather than gradual. - **G. depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential increases. Our case starts positive and ends negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall this term being used in standard neuron terminology. Synapses are connections between neurons, but the term seems specific. - **I. refractory period**: This is about a period where a neuron can\u2019t fire again, not related to the membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: Repolarization is the reverse of depolarization, moving back up.

So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potentials could refer to different states, but again, our situation isn't about varying levels\u2014it's a specific transition. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge. Our case is decreasing, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall synapses being directly related to these terms here.\n- **I. refractory period**: As mentioned earlier, this relates to inability to fire once an action potential arrives, not to the membrane potential itself.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases toward its resting state. However, in this case, it decreased further into the negative, so it's more than just repolarization.\n- **K. rest**: The question doesn't specify resting anymore, but the initial part is moving away from resting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the correct answer should be **B. hyperpolarization** because the membrane potential is becoming more negative than the resting potential.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential.

So, actually, the correct options are B and G? Wait, no, because G is depolarization, which is increasing positive, while our case is decreasing. So neither B nor G fit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.\n\nThe initial membrane potential is +50 mV, which is less negative than the resting potential of ~-60 mV. Then it goes to -70 mV, which is even more negative. So, does this represent hyperpolarization or something else?\n\nWait, hyperpolarization occurs when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. In this case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is way beyond the resting potential. That suggests it's becoming more depolarized, right? Because from +50 to -70, you're moving away from the resting potential towards higher negatives. So, that's definitely hyperpolarization. Also, since the membrane potential is changing over time, it's likely an action potential, but wait, an action potential involves depolarization, which isn't happening here\u2014it's becoming more negative. So, maybe it's not an action potential either. Alternatively, it's a depolarization event, but the term 'action' implies a wave-like change. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the membrane potential is becoming more negative, it's a type of depolarization. But the answer choices include both 'departs' and other terms. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\nA. threshold potential\nB. hyperpolarization\nC. action potential\nD. equilibrium potential\nE. resting potential\nF. graded potential\nG. depolarization\nH. synapse potential\nI. refractory period\nJ. repolarization\nK. rest potential (assuming typo)\n\nSo, the correct terms seem to be either B (hyperpolarization) or G (depolarization).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying levels, but again, it's just a single point change. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge. The membrane potential decreased, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall synapse potential being a standard term. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire once an action potential arrives. Not relevant here. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential. Again, we started at +50 and ended at -70, so it's not repolarization. - **K. rest potential**: Wait, maybe K is typoed. Resting potential should be option E. So, actually, the correct options are B and G? Wait, no, because G is depolarization, which is increasing positive, while our case is decreasing. So neither B nor G fit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.\n\nThe initial membrane potential is +50 mV, which is less negative than the resting potential of ~-60 mV. Then it goes to -70 mV, which is even more negative. So, does this represent hyperpolarization or something else?\n\nWait, hyperpolarization occurs when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. In this case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is way beyond the resting potential. That suggests it's becoming more depolarized, right? Because from +50 to -70, you're moving away from the resting potential towards higher negatives. So, that's definitely hyperpolarization. Also, since the membrane potential is changing over time, it's likely an action potential, but wait, an action potential involves depolarization, which isn't happening here\u2014it's becoming more negative. So, maybe it's not an action potential either. Alternatively, it's a depolarization event, but the term 'action' implies a wave-like change. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the membrane potential is becoming more negative, it's a type of depolarization. But the answer choices include both 'departs' and other terms. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\nA. threshold potential\nB. hyperpolarization\nC. action potential\nD. equilibrium potential\nE. resting potential\nF. graded potential\nG. depolarization\nH. synapse potential\nI. refractory period\nJ. repolarization\nK. rest potential (assuming typo)\n\nSo, the correct terms seem to be either B (hyperpolarization) or G (depolarization). But in reality, the process is depolarization leading to action potential formation. However, the question doesn't ask about the mechanism but rather the outcome. So, the membrane potential changes from +50 to -70 mV, indicating it's becoming more depolarized, which is called depolarization. But also, it's becoming more negative, which is hyperpolarization. So, both terms apply.\n\nLooking at the options, B and G are possible. But which is more accurate? Hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential.

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potentials vary between resting and depolarization states. While the process involves moving through these states, the specific change from +50 to -70 suggests it's more about hyperpolarization rather than a graded potential. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge. We started high positive and ended up more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall this being a standard term. Synapses are connections between neurons, involving neurotransmitters, but I'm not sure about \"synapse potential.\" - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire again after a brief period. Doesn't fit because we saw a significant drop. - **J. repolarization**: This is returning to a higher potential after depolarization. Our case starts high and ends even lower, so not repolarization. - **K. none of the above**: Well, B seems correct, but let me double-check.\n\nSo, starting at +50 mV, ending at -70 mV. That means the membrane potential decreased significantly. From a resting-like state (around -60 mV) to a very negative value. In terms of terminology, hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential moves beyond the resting potential, becoming more negative. So yes, option B fits.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: I'm unsure about this, but I don't recall it being a standard term in this context.\n- **G. depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential increases. Our case starts high positive but ends up negative, so it's not depolarization.\n- **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term, probably irrelevant.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire after a certain period, not directly about membrane potential changes.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back toward its resting state. Here, the membrane potential went negative, so it's not just decreasing back up\u2014it's gone far beyond the resting level.\n\nSo, putting it together: The membrane potential started at +50 mV and ended at -70 mV. That indicates a significant decrease in membrane potential, moving well into the negative territory. Among the options, B is hyperpolarization, which fits because the potential became more negative than its resting state. Other options either describe opposite events or unrelated phenomena. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Yes, because it started at +50 and ended at -70, showing a significant drop.\n- **K. rest**: No, as discussed earlier.\n\nSo the most accurate answer seems to be B. hyperpolarization, because the membrane potential moved from a high positive to a much higher negative value, exceeding the resting potential.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential.",

Yes, because it went from +50 to -70, which is significant depolarization followed by significant repolarization. Wait, actually, since it's going directly from +50 to -70, that's a large change, possibly beyond just repolarizing. Hmm, maybe J isn't correct. - **K. repolarization**: As per the options, K is repolarization, which fits because it's returning towards the resting potential. So, both B and J seem possible. But looking back, the membrane potential first increases to +50, then drops to -70. Repolarization implies returning to rest, so yes, that's correct. Also, hyperpolarization is the process leading to more depolarization, but the exact term used here is \"repolarization.\" However, sometimes \"hyperpolarization\" is used interchangeably, but strictly speaking, hyperpolarization is a result. Maybe B is the better answer. Alternatively, considering that the entire change is from +50 to -70, which includes both depolarization and hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question asks what the change represents. So, starting at +50 and ending at -70, the membrane potential has become more negative, which is hyperpolarization. Therefore, B is correct.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potentials could imply different states, but I don't think that's the right term here. It's probably referring to different ranges rather than specific terms. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge, moving away from resting. The membrane potential decreased, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: I'm not familiar with this term, so maybe it's not correct. - **I. refractory period**: As mentioned earlier, this is about periods during which a neuron can't fire.

The membrane potential went beyond resting, so this doesn't fit. - **K. rest**: No, because the membrane potential is changing. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the best answer seems to be B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: I'm not sure if this applies here. Graded potentials could refer to different states, but without more context, I don't think it's correct. - **G. depolarization**: As I thought earlier, this is increasing positive charge. Our final membrane potential is more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this either. Synapses involve neurotransmitters and ion exchange, but I don't think that's the right term here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire again due to previous action potential, not directly about changing membrane potential. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential. Our case doesn't show this; instead, it's a significant drop to more negative. - **K. rest**: No, because the membrane potential isn't at rest; it's actively changing. - **L. no option matches?** Wait, all the options seem to cover possible scenarios except maybe G. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, the initial state is +50 mV, which is a high positive potential. Then it drops to -70, which is very negative. So, the membrane potential became more depolarized. In the options, B is hyperpolarization, which fits because it moved further into the negative direction beyond resting potential (-60). Also, C is action potential, which requires depolarization, but since the membrane potential didn't increase, it's not an action potential. D is equilibrium, which wouldn't happen unless there's no change. E is resting, which wasn't reached. F is graded, which isn't standard terminology here. G is depolarization, which isn't the case. H is synapse potential, which isn't applicable. J is repolarization, which is decreasing back up. K is rest, which isn't correct. L is none of the above, but wait, the options go up to I, J, etc., so maybe I missed something. Alternatively, thinking again: The membrane potential is moving from +50 to -70, which is a big change, possibly indicating a depolarization event. However, the question asks what type of potential this represents. The change itself is called depolarization, but the process causing this change is hyperpolarization. So, the question is about the result of the change, not the cause. So, from +50 to -70, the membrane potential becomes more negative, which is hyperpolarization. So, the answer should be B. Hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential.

So maybe it's not rest. - **L. graded**: As before, it's not graded. - **M. depolarization**: No, as discussed earlier.\n\nWait, another thought: When the membrane potential moves from +50 to -70, does it go below resting potential (-60)? Yes, because -70 is less than -60. So, it's moving away from the resting potential into hyperpolarity. Therefore, option B is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential.",

Not directly applicable here. - **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards resting. In our case, it went deeper into negative, so maybe it's repolarization? Wait, but the initial part was +50, then to -70. So, starting from a positive, decreasing. So, whether it's repolarization depends on where you start. Repolarization would go back up, whereas depolarization moves higher. Since the membrane potential moved from positive to more negative, it's definitely depolarization. Hmm, but earlier I thought B was correct because it's hyperpolarization. Let me clarify. The term \"hyperpolarization\" refers to becoming more negative than resting. So, if someone's resting potential is -60, and their membrane potential goes to -70, that's hyperpolarization. So option B seems correct. Alternatively, action potential requires depolarization, which starts when the membrane potential rises. But in this case, it's moving further down, so it's depolarization. However, depending on interpretation, sometimes \"hyperpolarization\" is used interchangeably with depolarization, especially when considering how it affects the membrane potential relative to resting.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded potential could imply different levels, but the question doesn't specify any progression. Instead, it's a specific change. So F isn't correct either. - **G. depolarization**: While the membrane potential decreased, it's still a form of depolarization because it's moving towards higher positive charges. However, the term \"departs\" or \"becomes depolarized\" is sometimes used. But in this case, since it's moving away from rest, G might not be the best choice.

It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply multiple states, but again, the question seems to focus on a transition rather than multiple levels. - **G. depolarization**: That's increasing positivity. We started at +50, ended at -70, so definitely depolarization. However, the question asks about the overall change, which includes becoming hyperpolarized. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this term. Synapses involve connections between neurons, but the question doesn't mention anything about synapses. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to the neuron's inability to fire immediately after an action potential. Doesn't fit the scenario. - **J. repolarization**: Decreasing back towards resting potential. Yes, because it starts at +50 and ends at -70, so it did decrease. - **K. none of the above**: Maybe, but let's check against the other options.\n\nWait, the question says \"a change from +50 to -70.\" So, starting at a positive, ending at a more negative. So, first, it's depolarized, and then it becomes hyperpolarized. The question isn't asking about the individual phases but the overall result. So, what does that correspond to? The options are:\n\n- B. hyperpolarization: Yes.\n- J. repolarization: No, because it didn't go back up.\n- G. depolarization: Part of it, but the question is about the overall change from +50 to -70, which is a combination of depolarization and hyperpolarization. So, maybe both B and J are correct, but looking at the answer options, I need to choose a single letter. Alternatively, perhaps the correct term is hyperpolarization because it's the overall shift to the negative side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B because it's a significant drop into the negative range, making it hyperpolarization. Repolarization is the opposite direction. So, considering all, the best answer is B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Also, since it's becoming more negative, it's depolarizing as well. However, looking at the answer choices, option B is hyperpolarization, which fits perfectly. Option C is action potential, which doesn't fit because the membrane potential is changing, not stabilizing. Option F is graded, which is more general but not specific. Option G is depolarization, which is increasing positive charge, so it's not applicable here. Option D is equilibrium, which isn't happening here. So, the best answer seems to be B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different levels, but the term isn't standard enough for this context. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge, but our case is decreasing, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term, probably not relevant. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire immediately upon receiving a signal, not directly about membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential, but we started high and ended lower, so it's not just repolarizing. - **K. none of the above**: None of these fit because B is correct.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. The starting point was +50 mV, which is less than resting (-60 mV). Then it drops to -70 mV, which is even more negative, so definitely hyperpolarization. So option B seems right.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but again, our membrane potential changes quite a bit. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge. Our potential decreased, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure, but probably not relevant here.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire due to electrical activity, not membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential. Our membrane potential started high and dipped, but didn't fully return to resting\u2014it went all the way to -70, so maybe not repolarization. Wait, repolarization typically refers to returning to rest, but sometimes it's used interchangeably. However, in this case, it's more extreme. - **K. repulsion**: No, this doesn't make sense. - **L. none of the above**: Maybe, since none of the other options fit.\n\nWait, the initial state was +50 mV, then it became -70. So, the membrane potential went from a positive to a very negative value. What does that indicate? It's definitely becoming hyperpolarized because hyperpolarization is moving away from resting potential into more negative states. Also, this is a significant depolarization, which is characteristic of action potentials. But wait, the question is asking what type of potential change it represents. The options include \"hyperpolarization,\" which is B. Alternatively, if it's a change from a positive to a negative, it's a depolarization. But the answer choices don't directly ask for whether it's depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. Instead, looking at the options:\n\nA. threshold: Probably not, as we haven't reached the threshold yet.\n\nB. hyperpolarization: Yes, because we moved far into the negative range beyond resting potential.\n\nC. action potential: Doesn't apply because it's a decrease, not increase.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory.

If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: This could relate to different states of membrane potential, maybe different regions having varying potentials. It's a possibility, but it doesn't directly describe the transition. - **G. depolarization**: While the membrane potential decreased from positive to negative, the initial part was depolarization. However, the entire process isn't just depolarization because it includes hyperpolarization as well. - **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall what synapse potential refers to in this context. Maybe it's something else entirely, but it's unlikely to be correct. - **I. refractory period**: This is about periods where a neuron can't fire again, not related to the membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential increases back towards resting potential. Our case is decreasing, so it's not repolarization. - **K. repolarization** [Wait, maybe K is another typo? Probably J]. - **L. rest** [Not listed]. So, considering all these, the most accurate answer seems to be B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply varying potentials, but again, we saw a significant drop, not just gradual. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in membrane potential. We see a decrease, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar enough to assess.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire due to electrical activity, not directly about the membrane potential change.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back toward resting potential after an action potential. Again, our case is a complete reversal, so it's not repolarization.\n- **K. rest**: No, because the membrane potential isn't returning to rest.\n- **L. gradations**: As before, not matching.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the correct answer should relate to the membrane potential decreasing beyond the resting potential. Therefore, \"hyperpolarization\" seems right because it indicates the potential becoming more negative than the resting value. Wait, but sometimes \"hyperpolarization\" can also refer to being more negative than resting, while \"degenerative potential\" might be another term. However, in standard terminology, \"hyperpolarization\" is commonly used to describe becoming more negative than resting. So, option B is likely the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: I'm unsure about this. Graded potentials could imply different states, maybe depending on other factors like ion concentrations, but the question doesn't provide enough context. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge. Our case is decreasing, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall anything about synapses being related to membrane potential changes here.\n- **I. refractory period**: This is about inability to fire, not directly related to the change in membrane potential.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back toward its resting state. Here, it went too far into the negative, so it's not just repolarization but also indicates something else happened.\n\nSo, putting it together, the membrane potential decreased significantly from +50 to -70. That's characteristic of hyperpolarization because it's moving away from rest (which is typically around -60 mV). Therefore, the correct answer should be B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon.

No indication of such behavior here. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back towards resting potential. However, our membrane potential went beyond resting potential, so it's not repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, the question is about changing membrane potential. - **L. synapse potential**: Probably not. So, putting it all together, the most accurate description is **hyperpolarization**, because the membrane potential moved towards more negative values.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential.",
    "chunk_resampled": "- **F. graded potential**: I don't recall this being a standard term.",
    "rollout": " - **F. graded potential**: I don't recall this being a standard term. It might be a less common way to describe different membrane potentials. - **G. depolarization**: This is increasing positive charge.

Wait, no\u2014it's moving away from positive towards negative, which could be seen as depolarizing, but the terminology might vary. Some sources say depolarization is when the potential increases positively, while others consider it as decreasing from a baseline. So depending on interpretation, G might still apply. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't see how this relates directly. - **I. refractory period**: This is about periods where neurons can't fire, not about membrane potential changes. - **J. repolarization**: Repolarization is returning to the resting state after depolarization. Here, it's going deeper into negative, so it's not repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, the question isn't about being at rest. - **L. synapse**: Again, unrelated. \n\nSo, the most accurate term seems to be B. hyperpolarization because the membrane potential moved from a higher to a much lower value, indicating decreased hyperpolarity.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",
