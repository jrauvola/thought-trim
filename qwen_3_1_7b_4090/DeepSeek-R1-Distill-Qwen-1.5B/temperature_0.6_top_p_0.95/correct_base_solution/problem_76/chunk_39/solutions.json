    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge.",

Option F is graded potential, but our change doesn't fit either. Let me double-check. When the membrane potential becomes more negative than its resting state, it's called hyperpolarization.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory.

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. The membrane potential went from +50 to -70, so it's actually becoming more negative, which is depolarization? Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Depolarization increases positivity. So moving from +50 to -70 would involve both increasing negativity and decreasing overall positive charge. Maybe it's best to stick with hyperpolarization as B. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term. Probably not relevant here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire, not directly about changing membrane potential. - **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back toward resting. In our case, it went to -70, which is more depolarized, so it's not repolarization. - **K. repolarization**: Same as J, but more precise. - **L. refractory period**: As above. - **M. grating potential**: Not sure. \n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be B. hyperpolarization because the membrane potential moved from a higher positive to a much more negative value.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.

So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. Our case is a decrease, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses involve connections between neurons, but the question doesn't mention any connection. - **I. refractory period**: This is about periods where a neuron can't fire again. There's no indication of this happening here.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back toward the resting state. From +50 to -70, it's gone past the resting potential, so it's not repolarization.\n- **K. refractory period**: As before, no indication here.\n- **L. Another thought:** Maybe \"decrease\" isn't listed, but none of the options seem to fit except B.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the correct answer should be B. hyperpolarization because the membrane potential became more negative than the resting potential.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain.

It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. Our case is a decrease, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this one. Synapses involve the release of neurotransmitters, which affects the potential. Maybe it's related, but not directly applicable here.\n- **I. refractory period**: This is about a period during which a neuron cannot fire again, typically after an action potential. It doesn't fit our scenario because we're dealing with a change over time, not a blocked firing.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back toward its resting state. In our case, it went below resting potential, so it's a repolarization. But wait, sometimes \"repolarization\" is used interchangeably with \"departs,\" which is similar to depolarization. However, in this context, since the membrane potential decreased, it's more accurate to call it a repolarization.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the correct answer should be either B or J. Wait, but looking back, when the membrane potential becomes more negative, it's called hyperpolarization. Repolarization implies returning to a higher potential, which isn't the case here\u2014it's decreasing further. Therefore, the correct term is B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge.",
    "chunk_resampled": "We saw a decrease, so not depolarization.",
    "rollout": " We saw a decrease, so not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term. - **I. refractory period**: Relates to inability to fire again due to past activity. Doesn't fit the scenario. - **J. repolarization**: Decrease in membrane potential back toward resting. Yes, because it started at +50 and went to -70. Repolarization makes sense. - **K. hyperpolarization**: As discussed earlier, correct. - **L. resting potential**: No, as the potential went beyond resting. - **M. graded potential**: Maybe, but less likely than hyperpolarization. \n\nSo, considering all options, both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization) seem plausible. However, repolarization specifically refers to returning towards the resting potential, while hyperpolarization is moving further negative. In the question, the membrane potential decreased from +50 to -70, indicating a significant drop into the negative range. Both terms describe a change in membrane potential, but repolarization is the process of decreasing back towards resting, whereas hyperpolarization is becoming more negative.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. The membrane potential decreased, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: I don't recall synapse potential being a standard term here. Maybe it's not applicable. - **I. refractory period**: As mentioned earlier, this is a period during which a neuron cannot fire. No indication here of a refractory period. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential back toward resting. The question shows an increase, so it's not repolarization. - **K. rest**: Resting potential is -60 mV, as I thought before. The membrane potential went further negative, so it's not rest. - **L. none of these**: Well, based on previous reasoning, B seems correct.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From +50 to -70: initial state is high positive, then very negative. That fits with hyperpolarization because it's moving away from resting (which is around -60). So yes, B should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Therefore, the correct description is \"hyperpolarization\" because the membrane potential moved beyond the resting potential, becoming more negative.\n\nSo the answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow.

Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge.",

Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't recall a direct term for \"synapse potential.\" Maybe it's not applicable here.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire again quickly after a signal. Doesn't fit because the membrane potential is changing.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential back towards resting. So, if you go from +50 to -70, you'd have both depolarization and repolarization happening. Wait, but the question says the membrane potential changes from +50 to -70, which includes both a decrease in depolarization and a significant increase in repolarization. So J isn't the correct answer either.\n\nWait, let me reevaluate. When the membrane potential goes from +50 to -70, it's moving from a high positive to a very negative value. So, starting from +50, it's depolarizing until it reaches the resting potential (-60), and then it becomes more depolarized into -70.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is more negative, so it's actually hyperpolarization, not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this one. Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't recall a direct term for \"synapse potential.\" Maybe it's not applicable here.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire again quickly after a signal. Doesn't fit because the membrane potential is changing.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential back towards resting. So, if you go from +50 to -70, you'd have both depolarization and repolarization happening. Wait, but the question says the membrane potential changes from +50 to -70, which includes both a decrease in depolarization and a significant increase in repolarization. So J isn't the correct answer either.\n\nWait, let me reevaluate. When the membrane potential goes from +50 to -70, it's moving from a high positive to a very negative value. So, starting from +50, it's depolarizing until it reaches the resting potential (-60), and then it becomes more depolarized into -70. Alternatively, thinking about hyperpolarization as a broader term, where any decrease below resting is considered hyperpolarization. So B is correct.\n\nAlso, looking at the other options, C is action potential, which requires depolarization followed by rest, so doesn't apply here. Similarly, E is resting potential, which our final value isn't. F is graded, which is less precise than hyperpolarization. G is depolarization, which isn't the case since it's more negative. H is synapse potential, which isn't directly relevant here. I and J are about periods or movements, not the overall change.\n\nSo the correct answer should be B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. We're seeing a decrease, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are connections between neurons, and potential refers to membrane potential, so maybe not. - **I. refractory period**: As discussed earlier, this is about a neuron's inability to fire again quickly, not directly related to the membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards resting. In our case, the potential decreased, so it's not repolarization. - **K. rest potential**: Wait, I think K was missing in my initial list. Resting potential is the natural resting state, typically -60 mV. The final membrane potential is -70, which is even more depolarized, so it's not resting. - **L. Another thought:** Maybe 'degeneration' isn't listed, but none of the options seem to fit except B.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the membrane potential changed from +50 to -70, which indicates a significant drop into the negative range, making it hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

J (repolarization) also sounds right as it's about returning to the resting state. Wait, the question asks for a single answer, so maybe both B and J fit, but looking again, the change from +50 to -70 suggests significant depolarization followed by repolarization. Alternatively, perhaps the first part is hyperpolarization, and the second is repolarization.\n\nWait, actually, the entire process\u2014the initial decrease is not necessarily called hyperpolarization until it reaches a point where it starts moving toward rest. So, starting at +50, the membrane potential becomes hyperpolarizing (-70) and then eventually returns to resting. Therefore, the first phase is hyperpolarization, and the return is repolarization. So, the overall change is from normal resting potential (-60) to a more depolarized state, hence hyperpolarization, and then back to resting, which is repolarization.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking about the change from +50 to -70. So, the initial part is hyperpolarization (from resting to more depolarized), and then the final part is repolarization (back to resting). So, depending on whether the entire change counts as either, but the question is about the type during this change. So, the first part is hyperpolarization, and the return is repolarization. But the question is phrased as \"is considered\" in the options. So, the membrane potential changing from +50 to -70 is a hyperpolarization followed by repolarization. But none of the options combine these. Alternatively, perhaps the entire transition includes both aspects, making the answer hyperpolarization.\n\nWait, the question says \"is considered,\" implying the whole process. But the options are singular letters, so perhaps the entire change from resting to very depolarized is called hyperpolarization, and the reverse is repolarization. So, the answer would be B and J, but since we need a single letter, perhaps the correct answer is B, as the entire change represents hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. Our membrane potential decreased, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term. Maybe it's referring to something else, like the potential at a synapse, but I don't think that's standard terminology. - **I. refractory period**: This is a time when the neuron can't respond, so it's related to firing. The question doesn't mention timing, just the change in membrane potential. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning it towards resting. Yes, that fits because our membrane potential went from +50 to -70, so it returned to near resting. - **K. Aa bit confused on F. graded potential.** - **L. Synapse potential? Not sure.**\n\nSo, considering all options, B (hyperpolarization) seems correct because the membrane potential became more negative. J (repolarization) also sounds right as it's about returning to the resting state. Wait, the question asks for a single answer, so maybe both B and J fit, but looking again, the change from +50 to -70 suggests significant depolarization followed by repolarization. Alternatively, perhaps the first part is hyperpolarization, and the second is repolarization.\n\nWait, actually, the entire process\u2014the initial decrease is not necessarily called hyperpolarization until it reaches a point where it starts moving toward rest. So, starting at +50, the membrane potential becomes hyperpolarizing (-70) and then eventually returns to resting. Therefore, the first phase is hyperpolarization, and the return is repolarization. So, the overall change is from normal resting potential (-60) to a more depolarized state, hence hyperpolarization, and then back to resting, which is repolarization.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking about the change from +50 to -70. So, the initial part is hyperpolarization (from resting to more depolarized), and then the final part is repolarization (back to resting). So, depending on whether the entire change counts as either, but the question is about the type during this change. So, the first part is hyperpolarization, and the return is repolarization. But the question is phrased as \"is considered\" in the options. So, the membrane potential changing from +50 to -70 is a hyperpolarization followed by repolarization. But none of the options combine these. Alternatively, perhaps the entire transition includes both aspects, making the answer hyperpolarization.\n\nWait, the question says \"is considered,\" implying the whole process. But the options are singular letters, so perhaps the entire change from resting to very depolarized is called hyperpolarization, and the reverse is repolarization. So, the answer would be B and J, but since we need a single letter, perhaps the correct answer is B, as the entire change represents hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them.

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain.

Assuming J is correct, it's not repolarization. - **L. I'm missing something**: Maybe G. Or perhaps F. Graded Potential isn't right because it's not multiple states, but rather a specific type. Alternatively, maybe H. Synapse Potential is intended, but I don't recall exactly. Alternatively, C. Action Potential is incorrect, B. Hyperpolarization seems correct. Alternatively, E.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge.",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. We saw a decrease, so not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar enough to assess. - **I. refractory period**: Not directly related to the membrane potential change.\n- **J. repolarization**: Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards resting potential after an action potential. In our case, the membrane potential went beyond rest, so it's not repolarization.\n- **K. repolarization** again doesn't fit because it's the reverse process.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the membrane potential decreased from +50 to -70 mV, indicating it became more negative, moving away from resting potential (-60 mV). This fits the definition of **hyperpolarization**, where the potential moves deeper into the negative range relative to resting.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. We're seeing a decrease, so not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Maybe, but I don't recall this term being used here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire after a stimulus. No indication of such here.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards resting. Here, it went deeper, so it's not a simple repolarization\u2014it became more depolarized.\n- **K. rest**: No, the question isn't about resting.\n- **L. synapse**: Not applicable.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the correct answer should be **B. hyperpolarization** because the membrane potential moved from a positive to a more negative value, exceeding the resting potential.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. The membrane potential decreased, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Probably not relevant here. - **I. refractory period**: As discussed earlier, this relates to inability to fire, not membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is decreasing back toward resting potential. Since our final membrane potential is more negative, it's not repolarization. - **K. a. Repetition? No, probably irrelevant.** - **L. another thought:** Maybe \"equilibrium\" isn't correct because the membrane potential is changing, not stabilizing. \"Depolarization\" is increasing, which doesn't fit. \"Hyperpolarization\" is getting even more negative, which fits perfectly. \"Repolarization\" is decreasing but not as extreme as hyperpolarization. So, putting it all together, the answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't recall a direct term for \"synapse potential.\" - **I. refractory period**: As mentioned earlier, this is when a neuron can't fire again because of the elapsed charge. Doesn't fit here. - **J. repolarization**: Repolarization is the return of membrane potential to its resting state after depolarization. Since our final value is lower than resting, it's not repolarization. - **K. a.** Wait, maybe the options were cut off? Earlier, I thought it was G. depolarization, but looking back, option K isn't listed. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Option J is repolarization, which is returning to the resting state. Option B is hyperpolarization, which is moving further into the negatives. Option F is graded, which is uncertain. Option C is action potential, which is depolarization leading to wave motion. So, the correct answer should be B. hyperpolarization because the membrane potential moved from +50 to -70, indicating a significant shift towards negative.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. We started at +50 and ended at -70, so it's actually becoming more depolarized. Wait, but option C is action potential, which is depolarization leading to depolarization, whereas G is just depolarization. Hmm, maybe G isn't correct because it doesn't account for the full reversal. Or perhaps I got confused. Let me double-check. No, action potential is specifically the result of depolarization followed by repolarization, which brings it back up. So, G is incorrect because it doesn't mention the return to resting potential. - **H. synapse potential**: Not familiar with this term in this context.\n- **I. refractory period**: This is a time when a neuron cannot fire again, not directly related to the membrane potential change.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back toward resting potential. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, so it's not a repolarization\u2014it's becoming more depolarized.\n\nPutting it all together, the membrane potential went from a moderate positive to a very negative value, indicating significant depolarization. This is a form of hyperpolarization because it's more negative than the resting potential. So the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential.

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. We're seeing a decrease, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Not sure about this term. Synapses are connections between neurons, but I don't recall this being directly related here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire again, not membrane potential change. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in positive charge. From +50 to -70, yes, it's a significant decrease, so repolarization fits. - **K. none of the above**: Probably not, as B seems correct. \n\nWait, but looking again, the change is from +50 to -70, which definitely indicates hyperpolarization because it's moving further into the negative range relative to the resting potential. Also, repolarization is a decrease in potential. So both J and G? Wait, no\u2014the options are singular letters, so either J or G. Let me check the options again. Option G is \"depolarization,\" which isn't right because it's a decrease. Option J is \"repolarization.\" So the answer should be J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. We started at +50 and ended at -70, so it's actually becoming depolarized. But the term \"depolarization\" typically refers to increasing, while \"hyperpolarization\" is decreasing. So G might not apply here because it's moving in the opposite direction.\n- **H. synapse potential**: Maybe referring to something else, but I don't recall this being a standard term.\n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to inability to fire again after a period, not directly about potential changes.\n- **J. repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back toward resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which suggests depolarization, not repolarization. Repolarization is when you go back up, but here it went all the way down.\n- **K. repulsion**: Not sure about this either.\n\nSo, putting it together: The membrane potential decreased from +50 to -70 mV. That indicates a significant shift towards depolarization, which is the reverse of hyperpolarization. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. hyperpolarization.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",
