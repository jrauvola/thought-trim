Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells.\n\nFirst, let's break down what each term means:\n\n- **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed).\n  \n- **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell.\n  \n- **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range.\n  \n- **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission.\n  \n- **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance.\n  \n- **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV.\n  \n- **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization.\n  \n- **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization.\n  \n- **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here.\n  \n- **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body.\n  \n- **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain.\n\nNow, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet.\n  \n- **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense.\n  \n- **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential.\n  \n- **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium.\n  \n- **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential.\n  \n- **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded.\n  \n- **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization.\n  \n- **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here.\n  \n- **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit.\n  \n- **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization.\n  \n- **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest.\n  \n- **L. synapse potential**: Same as above.\n  \nSo, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization.\n\nWait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting.\n\nIn our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.\n\nBut the options also include E (resting potential), which is incorrect because -70 is not the resting potential (-60).\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B (hyperpolarization) or maybe F (graded potential) depending on interpretation. However, since the question is about the change rather than the type, and considering the options, the most accurate description is hyperpolarization, which is option B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought J (repolarization) was correct because it's a decrease, but now I'm reconsidering because the question didn't specify whether it's a return to rest or just a decrease. The question only gives the initial and final potentials, so it's a decrease, which is repolarization.\n\nHmm, I need to clarify: the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, so it's more negative, meaning hyperpolarization. Alternatively, it's a decrease, meaning repolarization.\n\nWait, but \"hyperpolarization\" specifically refers to becoming more negative than resting, whereas \"repolarization\" is when it returns to resting, even if it's less negative.\n\nGiven that, the correct term is hyperpolarization because it's moving away from resting. But sometimes, people use repolarization interchangeably with hyperpolarization in the context of very negative potentials.\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, hyperpolarization implies moving toward the extreme negative relative to resting, while repolarization implies moving towards zero.\n\nIn the options provided, B is hyperpolarization, and J is repolarization.\n\nSince the question starts at +50 and ends at -70, it's a significant decrease, which is repolarization. So, J is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is referring to the overall shift regardless of direction, it's hyperpolarization. But in this case, starting at +50 and ending at -70 is a total decrease, so repolarization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",
