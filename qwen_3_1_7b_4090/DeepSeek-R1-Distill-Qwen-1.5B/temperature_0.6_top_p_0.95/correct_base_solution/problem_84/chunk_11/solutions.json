The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right. But let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them. Cytokines (F) are involved in immune responses and cell proliferation. So yeah, E definitely fits because pheromones are what release chemicals to affect others.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out which answer is correct for the question about chemical substances released by organisms that cause a response in others. The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right. But let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them. Cikines (F) are related to inflammation. Antigen receptors (G) might be a part of how the immune system detects things, but not directly causing response. Proteins (I) are enzymes' byproducts, so not the direct substance causing the effect. Antibodies (H) would recognize the protein. \n\nSo yeah, pheromones definitely fit here because they're responsible for signaling between organisms. I don't think any of the other terms fit as well. Pheromones work through chemicals that bind to each other, influencing behavior or physical traits in other species.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
