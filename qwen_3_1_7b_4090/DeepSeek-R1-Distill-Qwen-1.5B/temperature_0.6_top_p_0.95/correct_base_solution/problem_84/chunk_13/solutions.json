Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them.

Problem: Chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species are known as\n\nA. auxins\n\nB. neurotransmitters\n\nC. enzymes\n\nD. hormones\n\nE. pheromones\n\nF. cytokines\n\nG. antigens\n\nH. proteins\n\nI. antibodies\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out which answer is correct for the question about chemical substances released by organisms that cause a response in others. The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right. But let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them. Cytokines (F) are signaling molecules involved in immune responses and cell proliferation. So none of these fit except E, pheromones. That makes sense because pheromones are what causes the release and affect others.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out which answer is correct for the question about chemical substances released by organisms that cause a response in others. The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right. But let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them. Cytokines (F) are signaling molecules involved in immune responses and cell proliferation. So none of these fit except E, pheromones. \n\nWait, but sometimes I get confused between pheromones and other similar-sounding terms. For example, pheromones are also used in insects to coordinate behaviors, so maybe there's another term? No, pheromones definitely refers to those chemical substances.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out which answer is correct for the question about chemical substances released by organisms that cause a response in others. The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right. But let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them. Cytokines (F) are signaling molecules involved in immune responses and cell proliferation. So none of these fit except E, pheromones. That makes sense because pheromones are specifically for attracting or communicating with others, especially in animals.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
