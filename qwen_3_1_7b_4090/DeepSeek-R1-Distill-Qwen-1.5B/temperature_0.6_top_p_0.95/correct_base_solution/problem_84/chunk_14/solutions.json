Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them.

The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right.

Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them. Cytokines (F) are signaling molecules involved in immune responses and cell proliferation. So none of these fit except E, pheromones.

Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them. Cytokines (F) are signaling molecules involved in immune responses and cell proliferation. So none of these fit except E, pheromones.

Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them.
