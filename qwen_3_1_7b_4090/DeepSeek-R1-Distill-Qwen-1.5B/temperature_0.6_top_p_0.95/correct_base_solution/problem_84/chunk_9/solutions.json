The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right. But let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate body functions through chemical release. Antigens (G) are parts of viruses that help them stick to cells. Proteins (H) are large biomolecules made of amino acids. Antibodies (I) are proteins that recognize specific substances. Cytokines (F) are signaling molecules involved in immune responses. So yeah, pheromones definitely fit because they're what causes the response in others.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right. But let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate body functions through chemical release. Antigens (G) are proteins that help pathogen recognize each other. Proteins (H) are made from enzymes. Antibodies (I) are a type of protein that recognizes specific proteins. Cytokines (F) are produced by immune cells to signal other cells. \n\nSo putting it all together, pheromones (E) are definitely the one because they directly cause a response in another member of the same species. Other options are either signaling mechanisms (like hormones) or indirect effects (like pheromones).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions. Antigens (G) are part of the immune system; they recognize pathogens. Antibodies (H) are proteins that recognize antigens. Cytokines (F) are signaling molecules produced by immune cells. Proteins (I) are the building blocks of everything, including many hormones.

The options are A to H. First, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right. But let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate body functions, but they don't typically release substances themselves; instead, they act upon what's already there. Cytokines (F) are a type of hormone that regulate immune responses. Antigens (G) are proteins that recognize each other, used in diseases like HIV. Proteins (H) are large biomolecules, not chemicals. Antibodies (I) are proteins that recognize specific proteins. So yes, E is definitely the right answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
