  "source_text": "<|im_start|>user\nAnswer this question step by step with only a single letter. Problem: Chemical substances released by organisms that elicit a physiological or behavioral response in other members of the same species are known as\n\nA. auxins\n\nB. neurotransmitters\n\nC. enzymes\n\nD. hormones\n\nE. pheromones\n\nF. cytokines\n\nG. antigens\n\nH. proteins\n\nI. antibodies\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out which answer is correct for the question about chemical substances released by organisms that cause a response in others. The options are A to H.\n\nFirst, I remember that when an organism releases chemicals to affect others, it's called a pheromone. Pheromones are chemicals that can influence behavior and physical traits in animals. So looking at the options, E is pheromones, which seems right.\n\nBut let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Auxins (A) are involved in plant responses, like growth and development. Transmitters (B) are usually biological signals, but they're more often used in plants and fungi than animals. Enzymes (C) break down food into useful molecules without changing their structure. Hormones (D) regulate internal bodily functions based on hormone levels. Antigens (G) are parts of the immune system, and antibodies (H) neutralize them. Cytokines (F) are signaling molecules involved in immune responses and cell proliferation. \n\nSo none of these fit except E, pheromones. They release these chemicals to attract or influence others, much like how ants use pheromones. That makes sense because pheromones are widely recognized in biology.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
