  "problem": "Partial diploids can be produced in the bacterium E. coli for thelacoperon. As a consequence, some mutations can be bypassedin terms of their disruption of theoperonby productionof the partial diploids with wild-type alleles at the sitesof mutation. In each case the wild-type allele is dominant to its mutant homologue. Determine for each of the following partial diploids whetherenzyme production will result constitutively or inducibly(normally) when the inducer molecule is introduced: (a)i^+o^+z^-y^-a^- i^+o^cz^+y^+a^+ (b)i^-o^+z^+y^+a^+ i^+o^+z^+y^-a^- (c)i^+o^cz^+y^-a^- i^-o^+z^-y^-a^-\n\nA.
