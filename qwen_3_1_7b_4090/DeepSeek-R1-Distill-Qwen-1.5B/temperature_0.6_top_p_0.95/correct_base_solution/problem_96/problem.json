  "problem": "Can complete equilibrium in a gene pool exist in real situations?\n\nA. Genetic equilibrium can be achieved only through selective breeding\n\nB. Gene pool equilibrium is maintained exclusively by mutation\n\nC. Gene pool equilibrium is disrupted only by natural selection\n\nD. Only large populations can achieve genetic equilibrium\n\nE. Complete equilibrium in a gene pool is not expected\n\nF. Complete equilibrium in a gene pool can always be achieved\n\nG. Equilibrium can be achieved when there is no gene flow\n\nH. Equilibrium is guaranteed when there is a high mutation rate\n\nI. Complete equilibrium is possible if the population is isolated\n\nJ. Random reproduction is common in real situations",
