We're told that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues, which means they have the recessive phenotype.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with dominant-recessive traits, the phenotypic ratio helps us figure out the genotypes. Since it's a dominant trait, having at least one dominant allele (heterozygous or homozygous dominant) will result in the trait being expressed. Only individuals who are homozygous recessive (both alleles are recessive) won't show the trait.\n\nThe key here is understanding how the percentage of people without the trait relates to the possible genotypes. In this case, since 16% can't roll their tongues, these must be the homozygous recessive individuals. Let's denote the dominant allele as 'A' and the recessive as 'a'. So, the genotype for someone who can't roll their tongue would be 'aa'.\n\nNow, if we assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which is often used in such problems, the frequencies of the genotypes can be calculated using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (A) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (a). Here, q\u00b2 represents the proportion of people who can't roll their tongues.\n\nGiven that q\u00b2 = 16%, we need to find q first. Taking the square root of 16% gives us 0.4. So, q = 0.4. This means the frequency of the dominant allele (p) would be 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNext, we want to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which have the genotype Aa. The formula for the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq. Plugging in the values we have:\n\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%. However, another thought comes to mind\u2014the question might be asking about the percentage of heterozygous individuals relative to those who don't have the trait.

Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, which means if you have at least one copy of that gene, you can roll your tongue. On the other hand, the recessive allele doesn't work, so people without the dominant trait aren't able to roll their tongue.\n\nNow, they tell me that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. So those who can't are the ones with two recessive alleles, right? Because if both genes are recessive, they don't show the dominant trait.\n\nSo, let's break down the possible genotypes based on the information provided:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (homozygous): Both alleles are dominant.\n- Heterozygous (heterozygous): One dominant and one recessive allele.\n- Homozygous recessive: Both alleles are recessive.\n\nGiven that 16% cannot roll their tongues, these must be the homozygous recessive individuals. So, the frequency of this genotype is 16%.\n\nIn Mendelian genetics, the Hardy-Weinberg principle applies here because we're assuming certain conditions like no mutation, random mating, etc., unless stated otherwise. So, the formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince the students with 16% unable to roll their tongues are homozygous recessive (q\u00b2), we know that q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which gives us q = 0.4.\n\nBecause the sum of all allele frequencies equals 1 (p + q = 1), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 0.6.\n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygotes have one dominant and one recessive allele, so their genotype is pq. Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq.\n\nLet's calculate that: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 2 * 0.24 = 0.48 or 48%.

If 16% are homozygous recessive, then the remaining 84% are either heterozygous or homozygous dominant. But according to the Hardy-Weinberg, the proportions should add up correctly. Let me verify the calculations again.\n\nYes, p = 0.6, q = 0.4. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16 (correct). The heterozygote frequency is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.

That means if someone has at least one dominant allele (let's say 'R'), they can roll their tongue. But the recessive allele ('r') doesn't work, meaning you can't roll your tongue unless both alleles are 'R'. \n\nNow, the problem states that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Wait, can't roll means they have two recessive alleles, right? So those students must be homozygous recessive (rr). \n\nSo, if 16% are rr, then how many are RR or Rr? Since the total population isn't given, but we're dealing with percentages, I think I can assume 100% of the students for simplicity. That way, the math will be easier.\n\nLet me represent the percentage as numbers. Total = 100%.\n\nStudents who can't roll (rr) = 16%. So, the remaining percentage must be either RR or Rr. That would be 100% - 16% = 84%.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (RR). Heterozygotes are those who have one dominant and one recessive allele. How do I find out how much of the remaining 84% is RR?\n\nIn Mendelian genetics, when there are two alleles (dominant and recessive), the distribution follows a simple ratio based on the number of genotypes. For a locus with two alleles where one is recessive and the other is dominant, the expected ratios are:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (AA): 25%\n- Heterozygous (Aa): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (aa): 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, AA is homozygous dominant, Aa is heterozygous, and aa is homozygous recessive. So, in this case, since the dominant trait is rolling the tongue, let's correct that.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the presence of the dominant allele allows rolling the tongue, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- RR: Can roll\n- Rr: Can roll\n- rr: Cannot roll\n\nSo, the 16% who can't roll are all rr. Then the remaining 84% must be either RR or Rr.\n\nSince the problem gives us that 16% can't roll, which corresponds to 16% being homozygous recessive (rr), we need to figure out the proportion of heterozygotes (RR) among the remaining 84%.\n\nAssuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which applies here because there's no mention of selection, mutation, migration, genetic drift, or non-random mating. So, the genotype frequencies should follow the expected proportions.\n\nThe formula for the frequency of each genotype under Hardy-Weinberg is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 100%, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r).\n\nGiven that the students who can't roll (rr) make up 16%, that's q\u00b2 = 16%. So, q = sqrt(16%) = 4%.\n\nOnce we know q is 4%, we can find p by subtracting q from 100% because p + q = 100%. So, p = 100% - 4% = 96%.\n\nNow, the frequency of heterozygotes (RR) is 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\np = 96% = 0.96\nq = 4% = 0.04\n\nSo, 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = ?\n\nCalculating that: 2 * 0.96 = 1.92; 1.92 * 0.04 = 0.0768, which is 7.68%.\n\nWait, but none of the options match 7.68%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms. The question asks for heterozygotes, not homozygotes. And 2pq gives the frequency of heterozygotes.\n\nWait another thing\u2014maybe I didn't account correctly for the fact that 16% can't roll. Let me re-examine.\n\nTotal students: 100%\n\nCannot roll (rr): 16% \u2192 q\u00b2 = 16% \u2192 q = 4%\n\nThus, p = 1 - q = 96% \u2192 p = 0.96\n\nHeterozygotes (RR) = 2pq = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 0.0768 \u2192 7.68%\n\nBut the answer choices don't include 7.68%. The closest option is F. 48%, which seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 16% are homozygous recessives, so the remaining 84% are either heterozygotes or homozygous dominants. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the proportions should add up to 100%.\n\nIf heterozygotes were 50% and homozygous dominants 25%, adding up to 75%, leaving 25% unaccounted. That doesn't fit. Maybe I misapplied the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects an approximate value. 7.68% is approximately 8%, which isn't an option. Wait, looking back at the options, F is 48%, which is much higher. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating 2pq.\n\nWait, 2pq = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 0.0768 \u2248 7.68%. None of the options match this exactly, but perhaps I need to reconsider my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that the 16% cannot roll, which includes both homozygous recessive and heterozygous individuals. No, that doesn't make sense because heterozygotes can also roll the tongue. Only homozygous recessives cannot.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, \"the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene,\" meaning that having at least one dominant allele allows them to roll. So, any student with at least one dominant allele can roll, regardless of whether they have one dominant and one recessive or two dominant alleles.\n\nTherefore, the 16% who cannot roll are those who are homozygous recessive (rr). So, the rest, 84%, consist of RR and Rr.\n\nUnder Hardy-Weinberg, the expected genotype frequencies are:\n\n- RR: p\u00b2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216 \u2192 92.16%\n- Rr: 2pq = 2*0.96*0.04 = 0.0768 \u2192 7.68%\n- rr: q\u00b2 = 0.0016 \u2192 0.16%\n\nAdding these together: 92.16% + 7.68% + 0.16% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Rr) is 7.68%, which is approximately 8%. Looking back at the options, the closest is E. 64%, which is way off. Wait, did I miscalculate something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and it refers to the percentage of students who are carriers (heterozygous) relative to those who can roll. In that case, the carrier rate would be 7.68/84, which is about 9.2%. Still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's denote:\n\nLet x be the frequency of the dominant allele (R). Then, the frequency of the recessive allele (r) is 1 - x.\n\nThe proportion of students who cannot roll (rr) is (1 - x)^2 = 0.16.\n\nTaking square roots: 1 - x = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 \u2192 x = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nSo, x = 0.6, meaning 60% of the alleles are dominant, and 40% are recessive.\n\nThen, the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr) is 2x(1 - x) = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 \u2192 48%.\n\nAh, so that makes sense. So, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, q = sqrt(16%) = 4%.\n\nOnce we know q is 4%, we can find p by subtracting q from 100% because p + q = 100%. So, p = 100% - 4% = 96%.\n\nNow, the frequency of heterozygotes (RR) is 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\np = 96% = 0.96\nq = 4% = 0.04\n\nSo, 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = ?\n\nCalculating that: 2 * 0.96 = 1.92; 1.92 * 0.04 = 0.0768, which is 7.68%.\n\nWait, but none of the options match 7.68%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms. The question asks for heterozygotes, not homozygotes. And 2pq gives the frequency of heterozygotes.\n\nWait another thing\u2014maybe I didn't account correctly for the fact that 16% can't roll. Let me re-examine.\n\nTotal students: 100%\n\nCannot roll (rr): 16% \u2192 q\u00b2 = 16% \u2192 q = 4%\n\nThus, p = 1 - q = 96% \u2192 p = 0.96\n\nHeterozygotes (RR) = 2pq = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 0.0768 \u2192 7.68%\n\nBut the answer choices don't include 7.68%. The closest option is F. 48%, which seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 16% are homozygous recessives, so the remaining 84% are either heterozygotes or homozygous dominants. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the proportions should add up to 100%.\n\nIf heterozygotes were 50% and homozygous dominants 25%, adding up to 75%, leaving 25% unaccounted. That doesn't fit. Maybe I misapplied the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects an approximate value. 7.68% is approximately 8%, which isn't an option. Wait, looking back at the options, F is 48%, which is much higher. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating 2pq.\n\nWait, 2pq = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 0.0768 \u2248 7.68%. None of the options match this exactly, but perhaps I need to reconsider my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that the 16% cannot roll, which includes both homozygous recessive and heterozygous individuals. No, that doesn't make sense because heterozygotes can also roll the tongue. Only homozygous recessives cannot.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, \"the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene,\" meaning that having at least one dominant allele allows them to roll. So, any student with at least one dominant allele can roll, regardless of whether they have one dominant and one recessive or two dominant alleles.\n\nTherefore, the 16% who cannot roll are those who are homozygous recessive (rr). So, the rest, 84%, consist of RR and Rr.\n\nUnder Hardy-Weinberg, the expected genotype frequencies are:\n\n- RR: p\u00b2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216 \u2192 92.16%\n- Rr: 2pq = 2*0.96*0.04 = 0.0768 \u2192 7.68%\n- rr: q\u00b2 = 0.0016 \u2192 0.16%\n\nAdding these together: 92.16% + 7.68% + 0.16% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Rr) is 7.68%, which is approximately 8%. Looking back at the options, the closest is E. 64%, which is way off. Wait, did I miscalculate something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and it refers to the percentage of students who are carriers (heterozygous) relative to those who can roll. In that case, the carrier rate would be 7.68/84, which is about 9.2%. Still not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's denote:\n\nLet x be the frequency of the dominant allele (R). Then, the frequency of the recessive allele (r) is 1 - x.\n\nThe proportion of students who cannot roll (rr) is (1 - x)^2 = 0.16.\n\nTaking square roots: 1 - x = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 \u2192 x = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nSo, x = 0.6, meaning 60% of the alleles are dominant, and 40% are recessive.\n\nThen, the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr) is 2x(1 - x) = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 \u2192 48%.\n\nAh, so that makes sense. So, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "rollout": "Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about tongue rolling ability and student percentages. Let me try to figure it out.\n\nFirst, the question says that the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene. That means if a student has at least one copy of this gene (either one or two), they can roll their tongue. The recessive allele doesn't give them the ability, so they can't. \n\nIt also mentions that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when you have two recessive alleles, those 16% must be homozygous recessives\u2014meaning both alleles are the same and not dominant.\n\nNow, we're asked to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means having one dominant allele and one recessive allele. In terms of Punnett squares, the possible genotypes for parents would determine the likelihood of each outcome.\n\nLet's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. So, the possible genotypes for an individual are TT (homozygous dominant) or Tt (heterozygous). The probability of each genotype depends on how many copies of the alleles each parent contributes during reproduction.\n\nAssuming both parents are heterozygotes (Tt), the Punnett square looks like this:\n\n- Parent 1: T t\n- Parent 2: T t\n\nWhen they cross, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n- TT (25%)\n- Tt (50%)\n- tt (25%)\n\nSince 16% can't roll their tongue, that corresponds to the tt genotype, which is 25%. But wait, the given data shows that 16% can't roll their tongue, but our calculation based on assuming parents are Tt leads to 25% tt. Hmm, maybe my assumption about the parents' genotypes is incorrect.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question doesn't specify whether the parents are heterozygous or not.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this genetics problem here about tongue rolling ability and student percentages. Let me try to figure it out.\n\nFirst, the question says that the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene. That means if a student has at least one copy of this gene (either one or two), they can roll their tongue. The recessive allele doesn't give them the ability, so they can't. \n\nIt also mentions that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when you have two recessive alleles, those 16% must be homozygous recessives\u2014meaning both alleles are the same and not dominant.\n\nNow, we're asked to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means having one dominant allele and one recessive allele. In terms of Punnett squares, the possible genotypes for parents would determine the likelihood of each outcome.\n\nLet's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. So, the possible genotypes for an individual are TT (homozygous dominant) or Tt (heterozygous). The probability of each genotype depends on how many copies of the alleles each parent contributes during reproduction.\n\nAssuming both parents are heterozygotes (Tt), the Punnett square looks like this:\n\n- Parent 1: T t\n- Parent 2: T t\n\nWhen they cross, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n- TT (25%)\n- Tt (50%)\n- tt (25%)\n\nSince 16% can't roll their tongue, that corresponds to the tt genotype, which is 25%. But wait, the given data shows that 16% can't roll their tongue, but our calculation based on assuming parents are Tt leads to 25% tt. Hmm, maybe my assumption about the parents' genotypes is incorrect.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question doesn't specify whether the parents are heterozygous or not. It just states that some students cannot roll their tongues because they have two recessive alleles. So perhaps the parents are such that the chance of producing a tt child is 16%.\n\nBut actually, without knowing the parents' genotype, it's hard to apply the Hardy-Weinberg principle directly. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the Hardy-Weinberg equation: p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t).\n\nHere, q\u00b2 represents the proportion of students who cannot roll their tongue (tt), which is given as 16%, so q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, take the square root of 0.16, which gives q = 0.4.\n\nSince p + q = 1 (the sum of allele frequencies equals 1), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nNow, the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt) is 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nSo looking at the options provided, F is 48%, which should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says that rolling your tongue is controlled by a dominant gene. That means if you have at least one copy of this gene (the dominant allele), you can roll your tongue. On the other hand, the recessive allele doesn't work and makes you unable to roll your tongue. \n\nNow, 16% of the students in the school can't roll their tongues. So those students must have the recessive allele because they don't show any trait when homozygous recessive. Let's denote the dominant allele as 'A' and the recessive as 'a'. Therefore, the genotype for someone who can't roll their tongue would be aa.\n\nSince 16% are aa, that tells us how many people have the recessive trait. But we're asked about the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygotes have both alleles, so their genotype is Aa.\n\nIn a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of these genotypes are determined by the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (A) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (a). Since the recessive phenotype is aa, which corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16, we can solve for q first.\n\nq\u00b2 = 0.16  \nTaking the square root of both sides gives q = \u221a0.16 = 0.4\n\nSo the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.4 or 40%. Now, since p + q = 1, we can find p:\n\np = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6\n\nWhich means the dominant allele has a frequency of 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNext, we need to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Aa). Using the formula 2pq:\n\nNumber of heterozygotes = 2 * p * q  \n= 2 * 0.6 * 0.4  \n= 2 * 0.24  \n= 0.48\n\nConverting that back to a percentage, 0.48 * 100% = 48%\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't mix anything up. So, q squared being 16% makes sense because 0.4 times 0.4 is 0.16. Then p is 0.6, correct. Multiplying them together gives 0.24, then doubling that gives 0.48, which is 48%. Hmm, but looking at the options provided, there isn't an option for 48%, wait no, actually, the user listed options from F to J, with F being 48% and G being 68%. Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through it again more carefully. Maybe I got confused between heterozygote frequency and something else. The total population is 100%, right? So if 16% are aa, that leaves 84% (since 100% - 16% = 84%) who are either AA or Aa. In the Hardy-Weinberg model, the proportions of AA and Aa are given by p\u00b2 and 2pq respectively.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the sum of all three genotypes is 100%. We know aa is 16%, so the remaining 84% is split between AA and Aa. However, without additional information like the frequency of AA or Aa, we can't directly determine the proportion of heterozygotes. Unless we assume some other condition, like equal distribution among the phenotypes, but that might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use another approach, such as assuming that the frequency of the recessive phenotype is q\u00b2, and thus q is sqrt(0.16)=0.4, making p=0.6. Then, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%, which matches what I calculated before. So why am I questioning this now?\n\nLooking back at the options, F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The recessive allele, which we'll call 'r', doesn't give you the ability. Now, they tell us that 16% of the students in the school cannot roll their tongues. So, these students must be homozygous recessive because they don't show the trait when both alleles are present.\n\nSince 16% are homozygous recessive (rr), that means 84% of the students are either heterozygous (Rr) or dominant (RR).

That means if someone has at least one copy of the dominant allele (let's call it 'A'), they can roll their tongue. On the other hand, the recessive allele ('a') doesn't make them able to roll their tongue because both alleles need to be present for that trait.\n\nThe problem states that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues. Since those students don't have the dominant allele, they must be homozygous recessive (aa). \n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Aa). Heterozygotes can roll their tongue because they have one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nTo find out how many are heterozygous, I'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Here, since 16% are aa (q\u00b2), we can take the square root of 0.16 to find q. \n\n\u221a0.16 = 0.4, so q is 0.4. That makes p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, the frequency of heterozygotes (Aa) is 2pq.

If 16% are aa, then q\u00b2=0.16 => q=0.4. So p=0.6. Then Aa would be 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%, but looking at the options, F is 48%. However, the answer choices include G as 68%, which might correspond to the total of heterozygotes plus the ones who are AA.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the Hardy-Weinberg equation.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the frequency of carriers (heterozygotes) can be calculated using the percentage without aa. Since aa is 16%, the remaining 84% includes AA and Aa. Assuming equal distribution between AA and Aa, each would be 42%, making heterozygotes 42%. But that doesn't fit either. Wait, no\u2014if the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the proportions are p\u00b2 (AA), 2pq (Aa), and q\u00b2 (aa). So if 16% are aa, then the number of heterozygotes would be 2pq.

    "rollout": "Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about tongue rolling ability and dominance alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the ability to roll the tongue is inherited as a dominant trait. That means if you have at least one copy of the dominant allele (let's say 'R'), you can roll your tongue. The other allele, which is recessive ('r'), doesn't work; you just can't roll your tongue. So the genotype would be RR or Rr for someone who can roll their tongue, and rr for someone who can't.\n\nNow, the question tells me that 16% of the students in the school cannot roll their tongues. Since those are the ones with the recessive allele, their genotype must be rr. So 16% are homozygous recessives.\n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one R and one r. Heterozygotes are carriers but don't show the dominant trait themselves.\n\nTo solve this, I think I should use the Hardy-Weinberg principle because it deals with allele frequencies and genotype distributions in populations. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r).\n\nSince 16% of the population is homozygous recessive (rr), that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which gives me q = 0.4. \n\nKnowing that p + q = 1 (since all alleles sum up to 100%), I can find p by subtracting q from 1. So p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. This means the frequency of the dominant allele is 60%.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr), I use the formula 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but let me double-check. Oh no, wait a second! Because the total percentage should add up to 100%, right? So p\u00b2 (dominant) is 0.36, 2pq is 0.48, and q\u00b2 is 0.16. Adding them together: 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. So that checks out correctly.\n\nBut hold on, the options given include B. 32% and C. 24%. Did I do something wrong? Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the heterozygote frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual number of people rather than percentages directly. But that shouldn't affect the proportions since the Hardy-Weinberg equations account for the ratios.\n\nWait another thought\u2014maybe I'm supposed to calculate the actual number based on the percentage. If 16% are rr, then the remaining 84% are either RR or Rr. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the ratio of RR to Rr is approximately 3:1. So 75% would be RR and 25% Rr. But 16% is already the rr group, so the rest would be RR (84% - 16% = 68%) and Rr (16% + 25% = 41%). Hmm, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests I might have applied the wrong approach. Perhaps instead of using the Hardy-Weinberg formula, I should consider that the proportion of heterozygotes is 2pq, which in this case would be 2*(0.6)*(0.4)=0.48 or 48%. However, none of the answer choices include 48%, except option F. Wait, looking back at the options, F is 48%.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the options are A through J, with F being 48%. So according to my initial calculation, the percentage of heterozygotes should be 48%, which is option F. However, I initially thought there was an error because I considered the actual distribution leading to 25% Rr, but that wasn't correct under Hardy-Weinberg.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me recalculate:\n\nGiven q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q=0.4 \u2192 p=0.6.\n\nThen, heterozygotes = 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 \u2192 48%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this genetics problem here about tongue rolling ability and dominance alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the ability to roll the tongue is inherited as a dominant trait. That means if you have at least one copy of the dominant allele (let's say 'R'), you can roll your tongue. The other allele, which is recessive ('r'), doesn't work; you just can't roll your tongue. So the genotype would be RR or Rr for someone who can roll their tongue, and rr for someone who can't.\n\nNow, the question tells me that 16% of the students in the school cannot roll their tongues. Since those are the ones with the recessive allele, their genotype must be rr. So 16% are homozygous recessives.\n\nNext, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one R and one r. Heterozygotes are carriers but don't show the dominant trait themselves.\n\nTo solve this, I think I should use the Hardy-Weinberg principle because it deals with allele frequencies and genotype distributions in populations. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r).\n\nSince 16% of the population is homozygous recessive (rr), that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which gives me q = 0.4. \n\nKnowing that p + q = 1 (since all alleles sum up to 100%), I can find p by subtracting q from 1. So p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. This means the frequency of the dominant allele is 60%.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr), I use the formula 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but let me double-check. Oh no, wait a second! Because the total percentage should add up to 100%, right? So p\u00b2 (dominant) is 0.36, 2pq is 0.48, and q\u00b2 is 0.16. Adding them together: 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. So that checks out correctly.\n\nBut hold on, the options given include B. 32% and C. 24%. Did I do something wrong? Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the heterozygote frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual number of people rather than percentages directly. But that shouldn't affect the proportions since the Hardy-Weinberg equations account for the ratios.\n\nWait another thought\u2014maybe I'm supposed to calculate the actual number based on the percentage. If 16% are rr, then the remaining 84% are either RR or Rr. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the ratio of RR to Rr is approximately 3:1. So 75% would be RR and 25% Rr. But 16% is already the rr group, so the rest would be RR (84% - 16% = 68%) and Rr (16% + 25% = 41%). Hmm, that doesn't match my earlier calculation.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests I might have applied the wrong approach. Perhaps instead of using the Hardy-Weinberg formula, I should consider that the proportion of heterozygotes is 2pq, which in this case would be 2*(0.6)*(0.4)=0.48 or 48%. However, none of the answer choices include 48%, except option F. Wait, looking back at the options, F is 48%.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the options are A through J, with F being 48%. So according to my initial calculation, the percentage of heterozygotes should be 48%, which is option F. However, I initially thought there was an error because I considered the actual distribution leading to 25% Rr, but that wasn't correct under Hardy-Weinberg.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me recalculate:\n\nGiven q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q=0.4 \u2192 p=0.6.\n\nThen, heterozygotes = 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 \u2192 48%.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The recessive allele doesn't work, so people without the dominant trait don't show it. \n\nNow, 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive allele isn't functional, these students must be homozygous for the recessive trait. In other words, both alleles they have are the same and non-functional. So, if we're using a Punnett square approach, those students would look like aa, where 'a' represents the recessive allele.\n\nNext, the question asks what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant allele and one recessive allele, like Aa. To find out how many are Aa, I'll need to use some basic probability concepts from population genetics.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of the dominant allele as p and the recessive as q. We know that p + q = 1 because all alleles add up to 100%. Also, since the recessive phenotype is expressed when an individual is homozygous recessive (aa), the frequency of aa is q\u00b2. According to the problem, q\u00b2 equals 16%, which is 0.16.\n\nSo, solving for q:\nq\u00b2 = 0.16  \nTaking the square root of both sides gives q = 0.4.\n\nSince p + q = 1, then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nNow, the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa) is given by 2pq.

But wait, no\u2014the total is 100%, so 16% are aa, leaving 84% who are either Aa or AA. However, the formula for heterozygotes is indeed 2pq, which in this case is 48%.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is controlled by a dominant gene, and if you can't (the recessive allele), then it's not possible. \n\nThey tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait doesn't show when the dominant one is present, those who can't must have two copies of the recessive allele. In genetics terms, that means they're homozygous recessive (aa). \n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygous (Aa). Heterozygotes can roll their tongue because they carry both alleles, so at least one dominant allele.\n\nI remember that in Mendelian inheritance, the probability for traits like this follows a certain pattern based on the number of generations. For a dominant-recessive relationship where 100% can express the dominant trait, all individuals would be either AA or Aa. But here, since only 16% are aa, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate the frequencies.\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since the recessive phenotype is aa, which is given as 16%, q\u00b2 equals 0.16.

If 16% are aa, then the remaining 84% (which is 100% - 16%) are Aa and AA. Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation again, the sum should equal 1. Let's see:\n\np\u00b2 + 2pq = 1 - q\u00b2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. Then, solving for the actual values: \nq\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = 0.4\np = 0.6\nSo, p\u00b2 = 0.36, 2pq = 0.48, and q\u00b2 = 0.16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this genetics problem. So, we're dealing with tongue rolling ability and genes. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is controlled by a dominant gene, and if you can't (the recessive allele), then it's not possible. \n\nThey tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait doesn't show when the dominant one is present, those who can't must have two copies of the recessive allele. In genetics terms, that means they're homozygous recessive (aa). \n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygous (Aa). Heterozygotes can roll their tongue because they carry both alleles, so at least one dominant allele.\n\nI remember that in Mendelian inheritance, the probability for traits like this follows a certain pattern based on the number of generations. For a dominant-recessive relationship where 100% can express the dominant trait, all individuals would be either AA or Aa. But here, since only 16% are aa, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate the frequencies.\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since the recessive phenotype is aa, which is given as 16%, q\u00b2 equals 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. \n\nThen, p, the frequency of the dominant allele, is 1 - q, so that's 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Aa), we use the formula 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If 16% are aa, then the remaining 84% (which is 100% - 16%) are Aa and AA. Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation again, the sum should equal 1. Let's see:\n\np\u00b2 + 2pq = 1 - q\u00b2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. Then, solving for the actual values: \nq\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = 0.4\np = 0.6\nSo, p\u00b2 = 0.36, 2pq = 0.48, and q\u00b2 = 0.16. Adding them up: 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. That checks out.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of heterozygous students is 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So that means the trait is dominant-recessive. \n\nNow, 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since those who can't roll are homozygous recessive (because they can't show the dominant trait), we're looking at the homozygous recessive genotype.\n\nIn a diploid organism like humans, each person has two copies of each gene\u2014one from each parent. So for tongue rolling, it's a dominant-recessive locus. Let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. So the genotypes would be TT (homozygous dominant), Tt (heterozygous), or tt (homozygous recessive).\n\nGiven that 16% of students can't roll their tongues, that means they all have the tt genotype.

The recessive allele (let's call it a) doesn't give them the ability, so they can't roll their tongue. \n\nNow, 16% of the students in the school cannot roll their tongues. Since these are the ones with the recessive allele, that tells me something about the frequency of the recessive genotype. In Mendelian genetics, when you're dealing with two alleles for a trait, like tongue rolling, the possible genotypes are AA (homozygous dominant) and aa (homozygous recessive). The aa individuals don't show the trait, which fits because they can't roll their tongue.\n\nSo, the percentage of aa students is 16%, which corresponds to q\u00b2 where q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Therefore, q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 or 40%. Wait, no, hold on. If q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q would be sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. So, q is 40%, meaning the frequency of the recessive allele is 40%.\n\nNext, I need to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygotes are those who have one dominant and one recessive allele (Aa). To find the frequency of Aa, I can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one.\n\nSince p + q = 1, p must be 1 - q. Here, q is 0.4, so p is 0.6. Now, let's plug into the equation:\n\np\u00b2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36 \u2192 36%\n2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48 \u2192 48%\nq\u00b2 = (0.4)^2 = 0.16 \u2192 16%\n\nAdding these up: 36% + 48% + 16% = 100%, which checks out.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the total number differently. Another approach could involve calculating the proportion of heterozygotes based on the phenotypic ratio.\n\nIn a class with two alleles (dominant and recessive), the possible phenotypic ratios are 3:1 (if the disease were dominant, but here it's recessive, so actually the ratio would be different). Wait, no\u2014if the recessive phenotype is not expressed unless homozygous, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1, but that's not applicable here since the recessive phenotype is non-functional. Actually, the phenotypic expression would depend on dominance.

Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the question says that being able to roll your tongue is linked to a dominant gene. That means if you have at least one copy of that dominant allele, you can roll your tongue. On the other hand, the recessive allele doesn't do anything\u2014so if both alleles are recessive, you can't roll your tongue.\n\nNow, they tell me that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait (can't roll) is when both alleles are recessive, those students must be homozygous recessive. So, let's call the dominant allele 'T' and the recessive allele 't'. Therefore, the genotype for students who can't roll is tt.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes are TT or Tt, but since TT would also show the dominant trait, we're focusing on the Tt individuals who carry the trait but don't express it fully.\n\nThis seems like a Hardy-Weinberg problem because we're dealing with allele frequencies and expected genotype ratios under equilibrium conditions. In Hardy-Weinberg, the equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t).\n\nSince we know that 16% of the population is tt (q\u00b2 = 0.16), we can solve for q first. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4. That makes sense because each student has two alleles, so the probability of having two recessive alleles is q squared.\n\nKnowing that q is 0.4, we can find p by subtracting q from 1 (since p + q = 1).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling ability and the students' genotypes. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the question says that being able to roll your tongue is linked to a dominant gene. That means if you have at least one copy of that dominant allele, you can roll your tongue. On the other hand, the recessive allele doesn't do anything\u2014so if both alleles are recessive, you can't roll your tongue.\n\nNow, they tell me that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait (can't roll) is when both alleles are recessive, those students must be homozygous recessive. So, let's call the dominant allele 'T' and the recessive allele 't'. Therefore, the genotype for students who can't roll is tt.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes are TT or Tt, but since TT would also show the dominant trait, we're focusing on the Tt individuals who carry the trait but don't express it fully.\n\nThis seems like a Hardy-Weinberg problem because we're dealing with allele frequencies and expected genotype ratios under equilibrium conditions. In Hardy-Weinberg, the equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t).\n\nSince we know that 16% of the population is tt (q\u00b2 = 0.16), we can solve for q first. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4. That makes sense because each student has two alleles, so the probability of having two recessive alleles is q squared.\n\nKnowing that q is 0.4, we can find p by subtracting q from 1 (since p + q = 1). So p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. This tells us that 60% of the students have at least one dominant allele.\n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (TT or Tt).

That means if you have one copy of the dominant allele (let's say 'R'), you can roll your tongue. The recessive allele ('r') doesn't allow that. So, the presence of at least one 'R' allele makes you able to roll your tongue.\n\nNow, the problem states that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues. Since those who can't roll don't have the dominant allele, they must have two recessive alleles. So, 16% corresponds to the homozygous recessive genotype (rr).\n\nIn Mendelian genetics, when dealing with dominant-recessive traits and assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to find the frequencies of each genotype. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince 16% are homozygous recessive (q\u00b2), let's solve for q first. Taking the square root of 16%, which is 4%. So, q = 0.04.\n\nBecause p + q = 1 (the sum of allele frequencies equals 1), p would be 1 - q = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nNow, we're asked about the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Rr). Heterozygotes have two different alleles, so their frequency is given by 2pq.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 2 * 0.0384 = 0.0768, which is 7.68%.\n\nBut wait, none of the options match exactly. The closest option is F, which is 48%. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check my calculations again. Maybe I misapplied the Hardy-Weinberg principle here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the recessive phenotype could also be due to other factors, but the question seems straightforward.\n\nWait, another approach: Since 16% are rr, then the total percentage accounted for by these genotypes is 16%. The remaining 84% (100% - 16%) includes the heterozygotes (Rr) and the dominant ones (RR). Assuming Hardy-Weinberg proportions, the ratio between RR, Rr, and rr is approximately 25:50:25, but since some people might not express the trait (like if the disease is autosomal recessive and not visible in the affected class), maybe the actual distribution isn't exactly 25:50:25.\n\nHowever, in this case, the question specifies that 16% cannot roll their tongue, meaning all the rr individuals (which is 16%) contribute to the recessive phenotype. But without more information on whether the dominant trait is expressed or not, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the dominance follows a certain pattern where the heterozygote has a higher chance than the homozygote. But usually, in Hardy-Weinberg, the heterozygote is considered as having an average fitness, but in terms of phenotypic ratios, it's still 25:50:25.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial calculation was correct. But 7.68% isn't among the choices. This suggests either I made a mistake or there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a scenario where only 16% are unable to roll their tongue, implying that the rest (84%) can. Among these, the heterozygotes (Rr) are twice as likely to show the dominant trait compared to the homozygotes. However, without knowing the exact probabilities, it's hard to apply the formula directly.\n\nMaybe I should assume that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and calculate based on the given data. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = 0.4 \u2192 p = 0.6.\n\nThen, the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr) is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. That matches option F.\n\nAh, so I see now. My initial calculation gave me 7.68%, which doesn't match any option except F, which is 48%. Therefore, the correct answer must be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, 16% corresponds to the homozygous recessive genotype (rr).\n\nIn Mendelian genetics, when dealing with dominant-recessive traits and assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to find the frequencies of each genotype. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince 16% are homozygous recessive (q\u00b2), let's solve for q first. Taking the square root of 16%, which is 4%. So, q = 0.04.\n\nBecause p + q = 1 (the sum of allele frequencies equals 1), p would be 1 - q = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\n\nNow, we're asked about the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Rr). Heterozygotes have two different alleles, so their frequency is given by 2pq.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 2 * 0.0384 = 0.0768, which is 7.68%.\n\nBut wait, none of the options match exactly. The closest option is F, which is 48%. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check my calculations again. Maybe I misapplied the Hardy-Weinberg principle here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the recessive phenotype could also be due to other factors, but the question seems straightforward.\n\nWait, another approach: Since 16% are rr, then the total percentage accounted for by these genotypes is 16%. The remaining 84% (100% - 16%) includes the heterozygotes (Rr) and the dominant ones (RR). Assuming Hardy-Weinberg proportions, the ratio between RR, Rr, and rr is approximately 25:50:25, but since some people might not express the trait (like if the disease is autosomal recessive and not visible in the affected class), maybe the actual distribution isn't exactly 25:50:25.\n\nHowever, in this case, the question specifies that 16% cannot roll their tongue, meaning all the rr individuals (which is 16%) contribute to the recessive phenotype. But without more information on whether the dominant trait is expressed or not, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the dominance follows a certain pattern where the heterozygote has a higher chance than the homozygote. But usually, in Hardy-Weinberg, the heterozygote is considered as having an average fitness, but in terms of phenotypic ratios, it's still 25:50:25.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial calculation was correct. But 7.68% isn't among the choices. This suggests either I made a mistake or there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a scenario where only 16% are unable to roll their tongue, implying that the rest (84%) can. Among these, the heterozygotes (Rr) are twice as likely to show the dominant trait compared to the homozygotes. However, without knowing the exact probabilities, it's hard to apply the formula directly.\n\nMaybe I should assume that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and calculate based on the given data. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = 0.4 \u2192 p = 0.6.\n\nThen, the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr) is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. That matches option F.\n\nAh, so I see now. My initial calculation gave me 7.68%, which doesn't match any option except F, which is 48%. Therefore, the correct answer must be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So first, I need to remember some basic Mendelian genetics. Since the trait is dominant-recessive, the possible genotypes for each student would be either homozygous dominant (homozygous) or homozygous recessive.\n\nLet's denote the dominant allele as \"T\" and the recessive as \"t\".

We know that q\u00b2 equals 16%, which is 0.16 in decimal form. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which gives us q = 0.4.\n\nOnce we have q, we can find p by subtracting q from 1 (since p + q = 1).

The other allele, let's say 'a', might be the recessive one and would mean you can't roll your tongue.

Since the question gives us the number of non-recessive (homozygous recessive) individuals as 16%, and using the Hardy-Weinberg formula, we've already calculated q\u00b2=0.16, leading to q=0.4 and p=0.6.

We're told that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. We need to find out what percentage are heterozygous.\n\nHmm, so first, I remember that when dealing with Mendelian inheritance, if we have two alleles (let's say A for dominant and a for recessive), the possible genotypes are AA (homozygous dominant) and Aa (heterozygous).

That means if someone has at least one copy of this gene (either one or two), they can roll their tongue. The other allele, which is recessive, doesn't work and makes them unable to roll their tongue. So, if we're talking about a student's genotype, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the possible genotypes for a student would be TT, Tt, or tt.

Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene. So if someone has at least one dominant allele (let's say 'R'), they can roll their tongue. But if they have two recessive alleles (like 'r'), then they can't. That makes sense because usually, having one dominant trait means you can express it.\n\nNow, the key point is that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since those without the dominant trait have two recessive alleles, that means 16% of the class is homozygous recessive (rr). \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Rr). Heterozygotes can roll their tongue because they have one dominant allele and one recessive one. \n\nSo, let's think about how often each genotype appears in a population when dealing with dominant traits. For a simple case where there are only two alleles (R and r), the frequencies of the genotypes follow certain rules based on the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. \n\nIn this scenario, since the trait is dominant, we don't expect any cases where both parents contribute a recessive allele because the dominant trait is already present. However, we do know the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (rr) is 16%, which translates to 0.16 in decimal.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg equation, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r). Here, q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q would be the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, p must be 1 - q, so p = 0.6.\n\nNow, the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Rr) is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that gives 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Maybe I made a mistake here. Because sometimes, in problems involving dominance ratios, especially when considering incomplete dominance or other factors, the actual number might change slightly. But in this case, the problem states that the dominant allele allows rolling the tongue, and the recessive doesn't. It also mentions that the inability is due to the recessive allele failing to convey the ability, implying complete dominance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculation should consider the ratio between the heterozygotes and the total population. Let me double-check the math:\n\nq\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 \u2192 p = 0.6\nThen, heterozygotes = 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 \u2192 48%\n\nBut wait, the options include F as 48%, which seems correct. However, another approach could involve considering the possible carriers.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling ability and blood groups or something like that. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene. So if someone has at least one dominant allele (let's say 'R'), they can roll their tongue. But if they have two recessive alleles (like 'r'), then they can't. That makes sense because usually, having one dominant trait means you can express it.\n\nNow, the key point is that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since those without the dominant trait have two recessive alleles, that means 16% of the class is homozygous recessive (rr). \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Rr). Heterozygotes can roll their tongue because they have one dominant allele and one recessive one. \n\nSo, let's think about how often each genotype appears in a population when dealing with dominant traits. For a simple case where there are only two alleles (R and r), the frequencies of the genotypes follow certain rules based on the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. \n\nIn this scenario, since the trait is dominant, we don't expect any cases where both parents contribute a recessive allele because the dominant trait is already present. However, we do know the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (rr) is 16%, which translates to 0.16 in decimal.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg equation, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r). Here, q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q would be the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, p must be 1 - q, so p = 0.6.\n\nNow, the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Rr) is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that gives 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Maybe I made a mistake here. Because sometimes, in problems involving dominance ratios, especially when considering incomplete dominance or other factors, the actual number might change slightly. But in this case, the problem states that the dominant allele allows rolling the tongue, and the recessive doesn't. It also mentions that the inability is due to the recessive allele failing to convey the ability, implying complete dominance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculation should consider the ratio between the heterozygotes and the total population. Let me double-check the math:\n\nq\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 \u2192 p = 0.6\nThen, heterozygotes = 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 \u2192 48%\n\nBut wait, the options include F as 48%, which seems correct. However, another approach could involve considering the possible carriers. If 16% cannot roll their tongue, meaning 84% can, and among these, some are heterozygotes and some are dominant homozygotes.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the majority are dominant homozygotes (RR), so 84% of the population is either RR or Rr. Among these, the proportion of Rr would depend on the Hardy-Weinberg probabilities. Using p\u00b2 + 2pq = 0.84.\n\nGiven that p = 0.6 and q = 0.4,\n\np\u00b2 = 0.36,\n2pq = 0.48,\nq\u00b2 = 0.16.\n\nAdding p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1.0, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me see if I can figure it out.\n\nThe question says that the ability to roll the tongue is inherited as a dominant trait. That means if you have at least one dominant allele (let's say 'R'), you'll be able to roll your tongue. The other allele, which is recessive ('r'), won't let you roll your tongue. So, the genotype for someone who can roll their tongue would be either RR or Rr, and the person who can't would be rr.\n\nNow, it's given that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since those are the people with the recessive genotype, that tells us that the frequency of the recessive allele (q) squared equals 16%. In equation form, q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4.\n\nSince there are two alleles in a gene pair (R and r), the total frequency of all alleles is 1 (or 100%). We already know the frequency of the dominant allele (p) because p + q = 1. So, p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Therefore, p = 0.6.\n\nNext, we need to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele). The formula for the frequency of heterozygotes (hetero) is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. \n\nLet's calculate that: 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, then multiplied by 2 gives 0.48.

Now, 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. I need to find out what percentage of them are heterozygous.\n\nHmm, right. So let's break this down. In Mendelian genetics, when dealing with dominant and recessive traits, we use a Punnett square. But wait, since we're given the frequency of homozygous recessives (the ones who can't roll their tongue), maybe I don't need to draw the entire Punnett square.\n\nLet me recall the Hardy-Weinberg principle because that should apply here assuming no selection, mutation, or migration\u2014so the frequencies remain constant from generation to generation. The formula for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the recessive allele, and p\u00b2, 2pq, q\u00b2 are the frequencies of the respective genotypes.\n\nIn this case, the students who can't roll their tongue must be homozygous recessives, which would be q\u00b2.

Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If q is 0.4, then p is 0.6. So the genotype frequencies would be:\n- Homozygous dominant (homo) : p\u00b2 = 0.36 \u2192 36%\n- Heterozygous : 2pq = 0.48 \u2192 48%\n- Homozygous recessive (homo) : q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 16%\n\nAdding those up: 36 + 48 + 16 = 100%.

The recessive allele, let's call it 'r', doesn't give the ability to roll the tongue. So, the presence of the dominant allele allows the trait to express, while the recessive allele masks it.\n\nNow, the key information given is that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive (so, the genotype would be 'rr'), these 16% must be the ones who are homozygous recessives.

To find this out, I'll need to use some basic principles of Mendelian inheritance. \n\nLet's denote the frequency of the dominant allele as p and the recessive allele as q. In a population at equilibrium, p + q = 1 because all alleles add up to 100%. Also, since the dominant allele is dominant, the frequency of the dominant phenotype (the tongue-rolling trait) will be p^2 + 2pq, where p^2 is the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals, and 2pq is the frequency of heterozygotes.\n\nGiven that 16% are homozygous recessive ('rr'), we know that q^2 = 0.16.

Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele is 60%.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr), we calculate 2pq.

But without knowing how many are homozygous dominant, we can't directly determine heterozygotes from just that.

In terms of probability, the chance of being aa is q\u00b2, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16, which implies q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele 'A' would be p = 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many students are heterozygous, meaning they have one 'A' and one 'a' allele. The formula for the frequency of heterozygotes (Aa) is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%.\n\nSo, among the students, 48% are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

On the other hand, the recessive allele doesn't work, so people who have two of these genes (homozygous recessive) can't roll their tongue.\n\nNow, the scenario given is that 16% of the students in a school cannot roll their tongues.

In such cases, the frequency of heterozygotes can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The formula for the frequency of heterozygotes (Aa) is 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nBut first, let's determine q from the affected individuals.

Another way is knowing that the total population is AA + Aa + aa. We know aa is 16%. The remaining 84% (100% - 16%) are AA and Aa combined.

So the key point is that having one dominant allele gives you the trait.\n\nNow, the problem states that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since those who can't roll their tongue don't have the dominant trait, they must be homozygous recessive. In other words, they have two copies of the recessive allele. \n\nLet me denote the dominant allele as 'A' and the recessive allele as 'a'. So, the genotype for someone who can't roll their tongue would be aa because both alleles are recessive.\n\nSince 16% have aa, that means the frequency of the recessive allele (a) is sqrt(0.16). Because in a Hardy-Weinberg population, the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (aa) is p squared, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele A. So, solving for p, we get p = sqrt(0.16) which equals 0.4 or 40%. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (A) is 1 - p = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNext, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant allele and one recessive allele, so their genotype is Aa. The frequency of the heterozygous genotype is calculated using the formula 2pq, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, pq is 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24. Then, multiplying by 2 gives us 0.48 or 48%. Wait, but I thought the answer was something else earlier. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, no. Actually, since the total percentage is 100%, subtracting the percentages accounted for by AA (4%) and aa (16%) should give us the remaining, which is 80% (AA + Aa + aa = 100%). But wait, AA is 4%, aa is 16%, so Aa would be 80% minus 4% minus 16%, which is 52%. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation: p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We know p\u00b2 = 0.16, so p = 0.4. Then q = 1 - p = 0.6. So 2pq = 2*0.4*0.6 = 0.48, which is 48%. But wait, another approach gave me 52%. There's inconsistency here.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the calculation. Let's clarify:\n\nTotal percentage:\n\n- AA: 16% (as given)\n- Aa: ?\n- aa: 16%\n\nSo adding up AA and aa gives 32%. Therefore, the remaining 68% must be Aa. So the percentage of heterozygotes is 68%. But according to the Hardy-Weinberg, 2pq = 48%. Which is correct?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the Hardy-Weinberg correctly. Let me recalculate:\n\nGiven that 16% (0.16) are aa, so p\u00b2=0.16 \u2192 p=0.4. Therefore, q=0.6. Then 2pq = 2*0.4*0.6 = 0.48, which is 48%. So why does the first method suggest 68%? It seems conflicting.\n\nWait, actually, when calculating the sum of all genotypes, AA + Aa + aa = 100%. If AA is 16% and aa is 16%, then Aa must be 68%. Therefore, the heterozygotes are 68%. But according to the Hardy-Weinberg, 2pq is 48%, which suggests that the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%. This discrepancy indicates an error in my understanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the Hardy-Weinberg principle accurately models the distribution under certain assumptions. So if the student's school follows Hardy-Weinberg, then 2pq should equal 48%. However, the initial data shows that aa is 16%, suggesting p=0.4, leading to 2pq=48%. Thus, the heterozygote percentage should indeed be 48%. Therefore, the correct answer is G. 68 percent? No, wait, 2pq is 48%, which is the percentage of heterozygotes. So the correct answer should be 48%, which corresponds to option H. 16 percent? No, that can't be right. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA.36\nB.32\nC.24\nD.40\nE.20\nF.48\nG.68\nH.16\nI.64\nJ.52\nK. etc.\n\nSo, the correct answer based on calculations is 48%, which is F. 48 percent.\n\nBut wait, initially, I thought the correct answer might be 48%, so I need to confirm.\n\nYes, according to the Hardy-Weinberg equations, with 16% aa (p=0.4), the heterozygote percentage is 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says that being able to roll your tongue is passed on by a dominant gene, and the recessive allele doesn't let you roll it. So if someone has at least one dominant allele, they can roll their tongue. Otherwise, they can't.\n\nNow, it's given that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait (can't roll) is expressed when both alleles are recessive, those students must have two recessive alleles. Let me represent this as:\n\n- R = dominant allele (can roll)\n- r = recessive allele (cannot roll)\n\nSo, the genotype for students who can't roll is rr. \n\nNext, I need to find out how many students are heterozygous (Rr). Heterozygotes can roll their tongue because they have one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nSince 16% are homozygous recessive (rr), the remaining percentage must be heterozygotes plus homozygous dominant (RR). Wait, actually, since each student can either be RR, Rr, or rr, these categories add up to 100%. So, the number of students who can roll their tongue is 100% minus 16%, which is 84%.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because in Mendelian inheritance, the total population isn't divided into just RR and Rr; instead, it's all possible genotypes. However, the key point is that 16% are homozygous recessives, so the rest are either heterozygotes or homozygous dominants. But since the question asks specifically about heterozygotes, I need to calculate how much of the non-homozygous individuals are heterozygotes.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of probabilities using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. In a large population, assuming random mating and no other evolutionary forces, the frequencies of genotypes can be calculated as p\u00b2, 2pq, and q\u00b2, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r).\n\nGiven that 16% have the rr genotype, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives q = 0.4. Therefore, p = 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNow, the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr) is 2pq.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this genetics problem here about tongue rolling ability and dominance traits. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says that being able to roll your tongue is passed on by a dominant gene, and the recessive allele doesn't let you roll it. So if someone has at least one dominant allele, they can roll their tongue. Otherwise, they can't.\n\nNow, it's given that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait (can't roll) is expressed when both alleles are recessive, those students must have two recessive alleles. Let me represent this as:\n\n- R = dominant allele (can roll)\n- r = recessive allele (cannot roll)\n\nSo, the genotype for students who can't roll is rr. \n\nNext, I need to find out how many students are heterozygous (Rr). Heterozygotes can roll their tongue because they have one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nSince 16% are homozygous recessive (rr), the remaining percentage must be heterozygotes plus homozygous dominant (RR). Wait, actually, since each student can either be RR, Rr, or rr, these categories add up to 100%. So, the number of students who can roll their tongue is 100% minus 16%, which is 84%.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because in Mendelian inheritance, the total population isn't divided into just RR and Rr; instead, it's all possible genotypes. However, the key point is that 16% are homozygous recessives, so the rest are either heterozygotes or homozygous dominants. But since the question asks specifically about heterozygotes, I need to calculate how much of the non-homozygous individuals are heterozygotes.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of probabilities using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. In a large population, assuming random mating and no other evolutionary forces, the frequencies of genotypes can be calculated as p\u00b2, 2pq, and q\u00b2, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r).\n\nGiven that 16% have the rr genotype, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives q = 0.4. Therefore, p = 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNow, the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr) is 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nSo, 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So, the question says that being able to roll your tongue is a dominant trait, meaning if you have at least one dominant allele (let's say 'T'), you can roll your tongue. The recessive allele (probably 't') doesn't allow you to do that.\n\nNow, it's given that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues. Since those without the dominant trait must be homozygous recessive (tt), right? Because if they had even one T, they could roll it. So, the number of tt individuals is 16%.\n\nWait, but wait. In Mendelian genetics, when you have a dominant trait, the frequency of the genotype isn't necessarily the square of the dominance ratio unless it's a simple case. But in this problem, we're told directly that 16% are tt, so maybe it's easier than applying Hardy-Weinberg equations.\n\nSo, if 16% are tt, then how many are TT or Tt? Well, total is 100%, so 100% -16% =84%. That would be either TT or Tt. Now, since the dominant allele is 'T', the possible genotypes for the students who can roll their tongue are TT and Tt.\n\nThe next thing to figure out is the percentage of heterozygotes (Tt) among those who can roll their tongue. To find that, I think I need to know the frequencies of TT and Tt in the population. \n\nBut wait, the question doesn't give me any information about the other alleles beyond the dominance. It just tells me the percentage of tt, which is 16%. Let me think. If 16% are tt, that means the proportion of heterozygotes plus the proportion of TT equals 84%. \n\nIn a diploid organism where the dominant allele is present, the probability of being TT is (1-p)^2, where p is the frequency of the recessive allele. Similarly, the probability of being Tt is 2p(1-p). And the probability of being tt is p^2.\n\nGiven that p^2 = 0.16 (since 16% is tt), solving for p gives p=0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (T) is 1 - p = 0.6.\n\nNow, using these values:\n\n- Frequency of TT = (0.6)^2 = 0.36 or 36%\n- Frequency of Tt = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%\n\nAdding them up: 36% + 48% = 84%, which matches our earlier calculation (100% -16%=84%). \n\nSince the question asks specifically for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), the answer should be 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Since those without the ability have the recessive genotype aa, that means 16% of the class is aa. \n\nNext, I remember that when calculating probabilities in a Hardy-Weinberg population, we use the formula p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. In this case, since 16% are aa, that corresponds to q\u00b2. \n\nSo, q\u00b2 = 0.16. Taking the square root of both sides gives q = \u221a0.16 = 0.4. This means the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 40%.\n\nSince the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%. \n\nNow, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Aa), which occurs when one dominant allele and one recessive allele are present, I use the formula 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\n2 * p * q = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to mix up the formulas. Another way to think about it is that the total percentage of non-heterozygotes (those who can roll their tongue) should add up correctly. Non-heterozygotes are AA and Aa. AA is p\u00b2, and Aa is 2pq.\n\nSo, AA is 0.6\u00b2 = 0.36 or 36%, Aa is 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 or 48%, and aa is 0.16. Adding these together: 36 + 48 + 16 = 100%, which checks out. Therefore, the heterozygote percentage is indeed 48%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, F is 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

For a simple recessive trait with two alleles, the frequency of the recessive homozygote (aa) is q\u00b2. Here, q\u00b2 equals 16%, because 16% of the students don't roll their tongues. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q is 0.4, meaning the frequency of the dominant allele (A) would be 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNow, for the heterozygous individuals (Aa), the frequency is calculated using the formula 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: p is 0.6, q is 0.4. So, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, which is 48%. \n\nLet me check the options provided:\n\nA. 36%\n\nB. 32%\n\nC. 24%\n\nD. 40%\n\nE. 20%\n\nF. 48%\n\nG. 68%\n\nH. 16%\n\nI. 64%\n\nJ. 52%\n\nSo, F is 48%, which matches my calculation. Therefore, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The recessive allele doesn't work, so people who are homozygous for the recessive gene (both copies) can't roll their tongue.\n\nThey tell me that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since those are the ones who can't, they must be homozygous for the recessive allele. So let's call the dominant allele 'D' and the recessive 'd'. The genotype for those who can't roll their tongue would be dd.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Dd). Heterozygotes can roll their tongue because they have both dominant alleles.\n\nTo solve this, I think we'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince 16% are homozygous recessive (dd), that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16.

Hmm, maybe that's a red herring because the question isn't directly about blood types or blood groups.\n\nThe question says that the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene, which means if you have at least one dominant allele (let's say 'R'), you can roll your tongue. And the recessive allele doesn't do anything; that would be 'r' and makes you unable to roll your tongue. So, it's a simple Mendelian trait.\n\nNow, they told me that 16% of the students in the school cannot roll their tongues. Since the recessive allele doesn't work, these students must have two recessive alleles: 'rr'. So, the frequency of 'rr' is 16%.\n\nI remember from Punnett squares that the probability of an individual having a certain genotype depends on how many possible combinations there are for the parents. But in this case, since we're dealing with the proportion in the population, we don't need to consider specific parent combinations. Instead, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that in a large population at equilibrium, the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remain constant from generation to generation.\n\nLet me denote p as the frequency of the dominant allele ('R') and q as the frequency of the recessive allele ('r'). According to Hardy-Weinberg:\n\np\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nHere, p\u00b2 represents the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals (RR), 2pq represents heterozygotes (Rr), and q\u00b2 represents homozygous recessives (rr).\n\nSince the students who cannot roll their tongue are all homozygous recessives (rr), their frequency is q\u00b2. They gave us that q\u00b2 = 16%, which is 0.16 in decimal form.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = 0.16 => q = sqrt(0.16) => q = 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele 'r' is 40%.\n\nBut the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous means having one dominant and one recessive allele (Rr). The frequency of heterozygotes is given by 2pq.\n\nTo find 2pq, I first need to find p. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of allele frequencies equals 1), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6 and q = 0.4.\n\nNow, plugging into 2pq:\n\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 2 * 0.24 = 0.48\n\nConverting 0.48 to a percentage gives 48%. Therefore, 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that rolling the tongue is controlled by a dominant gene, which means if you have at least one copy of that gene (like having one or two), you can roll your tongue. But the recessive allele doesn't do anything, so if both copies are the recessive one, you can't roll your tongue.\n\nNow, the problem states that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since those students can't roll their tongues, they must be homozygous for the recessive allele. That means each student has two recessive alleles.\n\nSo, the frequency of the recessive phenotype is 16%, right? Because 1 - 0.16 = 0.84, which is the proportion of people who can roll their tongues.\n\nIn terms of genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we know that the genotype frequencies are p\u00b2 for homozygous dominant, 2pq for heterozygotes, and q\u00b2 for homozygous recessive.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the basics. Rolling your tongue is linked to a gene. The presence of at least one dominant allele (let's say 'T') means you can roll your tongue. If both alleles are recessive ('t'), then you can't roll them. So, the genotype for rolling is TT or Tt, and not rolling is tt.\n\nThe problem says that 16% of students don't roll their tongue, which means they're tt.
