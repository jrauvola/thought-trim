The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues.

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since the recessive phenotype is 16%, which corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16, we can solve for q first. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives q = 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, we can calculate the percentage of heterozygotes using 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. Yes, 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, multiplied by 2 gives 0.48. So, 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. We know that q\u00b2 equals the proportion of students who can't roll their tongue, which is 16%. So, q squared is 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 40%, or 0.4. Now, since the total sum of p and q is 1 (100%), p must be 60%, or 0.6. With p known, we can calculate the frequency of the heterozygous genotype using the formula 2pq.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since q\u00b2 = 0.16 (because 16% of students can't roll their tongue), we can solve for q first. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives q = 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (which is 2pq), we plug in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. We know that q\u00b2 equals the percentage of students who can't roll their tongue, which is 16%. To find q, we take the square root of 16%, which is 0.4. That means q = 0.4, and since p + q = 1 (as all alleles sum up to one), p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (2pq), we plug in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48% as an answer? Let me check again. Oh wait, no, looking back at the options provided, F is 48%. So, that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since q\u00b2 equals the proportion of students who can't roll their tongue, which is 16%, or 0.16, we can solve for q. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4.

But since the question states that 16% can't roll their tongue due to the recessive allele, it implies that 16% is q\u00b2. So my initial approach seems correct. Hmm, looking at the options, B is 32%, which might come from 4pq instead of 2pq. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the calculation. Maybe I should consider that 16% are tt, so q\u00b2=16%, hence q=4%, then p=96%. So, the heterozygous frequency is 2pq = 2*96%*4% = 7.68%, which isn't an option. Perhaps there's another way. Maybe the 16% includes all individuals not expressing the trait, regardless of whether they're homozygous or heterozygous. No, the question specifies that 16% cannot roll their tongue, which would include both the homozygous and heterozygous cases. Wait, no\u2014the homozygous recessive (tt) don't show the trait, so 16% is just q\u00b2. So, going back, the heterozygous percentage is 2pq = 7.68%, but since that's not an option, maybe I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the 16% refers to the actual number of people who can't roll their tongue, not the percentage. But the question says \"what percentage of students are heterozygous,\" so percentages apply to the entire student body. Alternatively, maybe I need to re-express everything differently. Let's see: If q\u00b2 = 16%, then q = 0.4, so p = 0.6. The heterozygote frequency is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. That matches option F. So, perhaps I was overcomplicating earlier. The correct answer is 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% (q\u00b2) of the students are homozygous recessives, we can solve for q first. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which is 2pq, we plug in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%. Wait, but let me double-check. If 16% is q\u00b2, then q is sqrt(0.16)=0.4, so yes, p=0.6. Then 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. Looking at the options provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. We know that q\u00b2 equals 16%, which means q is the square root of 0.16. Calculating that, sqrt(0.16) is 0.4. So, q is 0.4, meaning the frequency of the recessive allele is 40%. Since p + q = 1, p is 1 - q, which is 0.6 or 60%. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes, which is 2pq, we plug in p and q. That becomes 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Multiplying 0.6 and 0.4 first gives 0.24, then multiplying by 2 gives 0.48, which is 48%. So, 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. We know that q\u00b2 equals the percentage of people who can't roll their tongue, which is 16%. So, q squared is 0.16, which means q is the square root of 0.16. Calculating that, sqrt(0.16) is 0.4. Therefore, q is 0.4, or 40%. Since p + q = 1, p must be 0.6, or 60%. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes, we calculate 2pq. Substituting the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 2 * 0.24, which is 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on a second\u2014the question asks specifically for heterozygotes who can roll their tongue. But according to our calculation, 48% of the students are heterozygotes. However, since all heterozygotes can roll their tongues, this number represents the proportion of students who can either roll or not based on their alleles. But wait, no\u2014actually, the question is asking how many students are heterozygous, regardless of whether they can roll their tongue or not.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% are homozygous recessive, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Then, p is 1 - q, so p = 0.6. Now, the percentage of heterozygous individuals is 2pq.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since the recessive phenotype is represented by 16%, which is q\u00b2, we can solve for q first. Taking the square root of 16% gives us q = 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1 (because all alleles sum up to 100%), p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes, we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. So, among the students, 48% are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, q = 0.4, meaning the frequency of the recessive allele is 40%. Since p + q = 1 (as these are the only two alleles), p = 1 - q = 0.6 or 60%. Now, the percentage of heterozygotes is calculated as 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since the recessive phenotype is 16%, which corresponds to q\u00b2 = 16%. To find q, we take the square root of 16%, which is 40%. Wait, no\u2014sqrt(16%) is actually sqrt(0.16), which is approximately 0.4 or 40%. So q = 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - q = 0.6 or 60%.

Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes, we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, 2 * 60% * 40% equals 48%. Wait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake there. Let me check again. Oh no, wait! Actually, the correct formula should be 2pq, where p is the proportion of the dominant allele and q is the recessive.

The options are A through J, with E being 20%, D being 40%, etc., up to G being 68% and H being 16%. So, 48% isn't listed explicitly except as option F. Wait, but I'm a bit confused now because I initially thought it was 48%, but another approach might give a different result. Maybe I should consider the total number of students and how many are in each category. For example, if 16% can't roll their tongue (tt), then the remaining 84% do roll their tongue (either TT or Tt). Among these 84%, some are homozygous dominant (TT) and others are heterozygous (Tt). To find the exact percentage of heterozygotes, we'd use the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Since q\u00b2 is 16%, q is 0.4, so p is 0.6. Then, 2pq is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. However, none of the options list 48% directly except as option F. But wait, looking back, the options include H as 16%, which matches the tt group, and E as 20%, which could correspond to something else. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me verify once more: in Hardy-Weinberg, the percentage of heterozygotes is indeed 2pq. Since q\u00b2 is 16%, q is sqrt(0.16)=0.4, so p=0.6. Thus, 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. But in the options, F is 48%, so that should be the answer. However, I recall that sometimes questions might present the answer as twice the heterozygote frequency over 100%, which aligns with 48%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. We know that q\u00b2 equals 16%, which means q is the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4 or 40%. So, the frequency of the recessive allele is 40%. Then, since p + q = 100%, p is 60%. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes, we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, 2 * 60% * 40% equals 48%. Wait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake there. Let me check again. Oh no, wait! Actually, the correct formula should be 2pq, where p is the proportion of the dominant allele and q is the recessive. But since we're dealing with percentages, maybe I should convert them into decimal form first. So, q is 0.4, p is 0.6. Then 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, which is 48%. But looking at the options provided, there's an option F which is 48%. Hmm, but wait, earlier I thought the answer might be 48%, but sometimes these problems might present it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of actual counts without percentages. Let me see the options again. The options are A through J, with E being 20%, D being 40%, etc., up to G being 68% and H being 16%. So, 48% isn't listed explicitly except as option F. Wait, but I'm a bit confused now because I initially thought it was 48%, but another approach might give a different result. Maybe I should consider the total number of students and how many are in each category. For example, if 16% can't roll their tongue (tt), then the remaining 84% do roll their tongue (either TT or Tt). Among these 84%, some are homozygous dominant (TT) and others are heterozygous (Tt). To find the exact percentage of heterozygotes, we'd use the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Since q\u00b2 is 16%, q is 0.4, so p is 0.6. Then, 2pq is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. However, none of the options list 48% directly except as option F. But wait, looking back, the options include H as 16%, which matches the tt group, and E as 20%, which could correspond to something else. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me verify once more: in Hardy-Weinberg, the percentage of heterozygotes is indeed 2pq. Since q\u00b2 is 16%, q is sqrt(0.16)=0.4, so p=0.6. Thus, 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. But in the options, F is 48%, so that should be the answer. However, I recall that sometimes questions might present the answer as twice the heterozygote frequency over 100%, which aligns with 48%. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the percentage of heterozygotes relative to the total population, which would still be 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.",

    "rollout": " Since q\u00b2 equals the proportion of non-recessive (non-tongling) individuals, which is 16%, q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Then, p is 1 - q, so p = 0.6. Now, the percentage of heterozygotes is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but looking at the options provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the answer. However, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the fact that 16% can't roll their tongue means q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q=0.4. Then p=0.6. Calculating 2pq: 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, yes that seems correct.
