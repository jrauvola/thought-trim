The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16.",

It says 16% cannot roll their tongues, which is the recessive phenotype. That corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then, p = 0.6. The heterozygote frequency is 2pq, which is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, or 48%. But the options provided are A to J, with F being 48%. Wait, but earlier I thought the answer might be 48%, but the correct approach leads to that conclusion. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the data. Perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of heterozygotes among all students, including those who can roll their tongue. Since 48% are heterozygotes and 16% are homozygous recessives, that accounts for 64% of the students, leaving 36% as either TT or Tt. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 48% + 16% = 64%, so the remaining 36% would be 2pq and q\u00b2? Wait, no, that's not how it works. Actually, the total is 100%, so if q\u00b2 is 16%, then the remaining 84% are TT and Tt. Since heterozygotes are Tt, the percentage of Tt would be 2pq, which is 48%. So yes, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That tells us that the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.4 or 40%. Then, since p + q = 1 (because all alleles are accounted for), p must be 0.6 or 60%. Now, the percentage of heterozygous individuals is given by 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, which is 48%. So, among the students, 48% are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1 (the sum of allele frequencies equals 1), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), we use 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. That converts to 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't have 48% listed.

To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That tells me the frequency of the recessive allele 't' is 40%. Then, since the sum of p and q equals 1 (because they're the only two possible alleles), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, or 60%. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (Tt), I use the formula 2pq.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1, p must be 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, the percentage of heterozygotes (pq) is calculated as 2 * p * q. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Multiplying these together gives 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014let me double-check my calculations. If q is 0.4, then p is indeed 0.6. Then pq is 0.6*0.4=0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48, which is 48%. But wait, none of the options provided include 48%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe the 16% refers to the number of affected students, not the homozygous recessives. Let me think again. If 16% can't roll their tongue, that could mean they're all homozygous recessive, making q\u00b2=0.16, so q=0.4, p=0.6. Then heterozygotes are 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%, but that's not an option. Looking back at the options, F is 48%, so maybe that's the answer. But why am I confused? Oh, maybe I should check the math again. 0.4 squared is 0.16, correct. p is 0.6, so 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, multiplied by 2 is 0.48. Yeah, that seems right. So despite the options including 48%, it might actually be that. Or perhaps there's another approach. Maybe using the fact that the total population is 100%, so the percentage of heterozygotes is 2pq=2*(0.6)*(0.4)=0.48, which is 48%. So yes, F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

But wait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check. If 16% are tt, then q\u00b2=0.16, so q=0.4. Then p=0.6. Calculating heterozygotes as 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%. Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, the percentage of heterozygotes (2pq) is calculated as 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%.

To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That tells us that the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.4 or 40%. Then, since p + q = 1, p must be 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygous individuals (2pq), we plug in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but let me double-check my math. 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, multiplied by 2 gives 0.48. Hmm, but earlier I thought the answer might be 48%, which is option F. But wait, no\u2014the question asks for the percentage of heterozygotes, not the percentage expressing the trait. However, all heterozygotes will express the dominant trait, so the number of heterozygotes should be equal to the number of people who can roll their tongue minus those who can't (the homozygotes). But actually, since we're calculating the percentage directly from the Hardy-Weinberg formula, 2pq should give us the proportion of heterozygotes. So, 2pq is 48%, which matches option F. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since 16% are homozygous recessives, the remaining 84% (which includes the heterozygotes and the homozygous dominant) must be either heterozygotes or dominant homozygotes. But without knowing the exact distribution between these two categories, we can't determine the exact percentage of heterozygotes individually. However, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation allows us to calculate 2pq accurately based on the known value of q\u00b2. So, the correct answer should be 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1 (as allele frequencies sum up to 100%), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48%, let me check the options again. Oh, option F is 48 percent. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again. q\u00b2 = 0.16 => q = 0.4. p = 0.6. 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But looking back at my initial thought process, I think I might have confused the question initially. The question asks for heterozygotes, not dominant or recessive. Yeah, so that should be correct. But wait, the answer choices don't include 48%, unless I misread them. Let me check: A is 36, B 32, C 24, D 40, E 20, F 48, G 68, H 16, I 64, J 52, K 64, L 52, M 68, N 16, O 64. So yes, F is 48%. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Perhaps using the fact that the total percentage is 100%, and if 16% are non-heterozygous, then 84% are either dominant or heterozygous. But without more information, that alone isn't enough to determine the exact percentage of heterozygotes. However, under Hardy-Weinberg, if 16% are homozygous recessive, then the rest (84%) are either dominant or heterozygous. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the calculation remains as before: q\u00b2=0.16 => q=0.4; p=0.6; heterozygotes=2pq=0.48=48%. So, despite the options having 48%, it seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Now, using these values, we can calculate the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt). The formula for heterozygotes is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That tells us that q = 0.4, or 40%. Knowing that the sum of p and q equals 1, we can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, which is 60%. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (pq), we multiply p and q together. That's 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24, which converts to 24%. So, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 24%. Looking back at the options provided, option C is 24%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since the sum of p and q equals 1 (because they're the only two alleles), p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygous individuals, we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but the options don't include 48%, let me check again.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 40%. Because p + q = 1 (since these are the only two alleles), p must be 0.6 or 60%.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Now, since p + q = 1 (because these are the only two alleles), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48% immediately. Let me check the options again: A.36%, B.32%, C.24%, D.40%, E.20%, F.48%, G.68%, H.16%, I.64%, J.52%, K. Something missing? Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again quickly. If 16% are tt, then q\u00b2=0.16, so q=0.4. Then p=0.6. Calculating 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. But looking at the options, F is 48%. However, sometimes people might confuse heterozygosity with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, like considering the percentage of carriers (heterozygotes) directly without calculating it from p and q. Wait, another way to think about it could involve knowing that in a diploid organism, the percentage of individuals carrying the dominant phenotype is p\u00b2 + 2pq. Since 16% can't roll their tongue, that's q\u00b2=0.16, so q=0.4. Then, the percentage of students who can roll their tongue is p\u00b2 + 2pq = (0.6)^2 + 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.36 + 0.48 = 0.84 or 84%. Therefore, the percentage of students who are heterozygous would be 2pq = 48%, which matches option F. So I think that's correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
