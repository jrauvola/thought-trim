The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16.

Assuming Hardy-Weinberg applies, the ratio of TT:Tt should be approximately 3:1, so TT would be 75% and Tt would be 25%, making sense. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, 48% are Tt, which fits into a 3:1 ratio. So, that makes sense. Alternatively, using the formula, since q\u00b2 = 0.16, q=0.4, p=0.6, then 2pq=0.48, so 48% heterozygotes. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, so that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, we need to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (which are 2pq), we multiply 2 * p * q. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 2 * 0.24 = 0.48, or 48%.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Wait, but hold on\u2014since the question asks specifically for heterozygotes, not the proportion of carriers. But in this case, since the recessive trait isn't expressed, the heterozygotes would actually show the dominant trait. However, the question might be asking about the actual presence or absence of the recessive allele. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about how many students actually carry the recessive allele, which would be heterozygotes, as they can't roll their tongue. Wait, no\u2014the question states that 16% can't roll, which is homozygous recessive. So, the remaining students must either be heterozygotes (who can roll their tongue) or homozygous dominant (who can also roll their tongue). But wait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, in a diploid organism, the presence of at least one dominant allele means the trait is expressed. So, any student who has at least one T allele can roll their tongue. Therefore, the number of students who are heterozygous would be the ones carrying at least one t allele, which includes both heterozygotes and homozygous dominant. But the question seems to ask for heterozygotes, which would be the count of individuals who have two different alleles. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"heterozygous,\" which refers to having one dominant and one recessive allele. So, if someone is heterozygous, they can't roll their tongue because both alleles are recessive. Therefore, the 16% who can't roll are homozygous recessive. The rest of the students, which would be 84%, either have at least one dominant allele (and thus can roll their tongue) or are homozygous dominant. Wait, no\u2014it's a bit more nuanced. The total population is 100%, so 16% are tt, meaning 84% are either TT or Tt. Out of these 84%, some are TT (homozygous dominant, can roll) and some are Tt (heterozygous, can roll). To find the percentage of heterozygotes, we need to know how many of the 84% are Tt. Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We know q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6. So, p\u00b2 = 0.36 (TT), 2pq = 0.48 (Tt), and q\u00b2 = 0.16 (tt). Adding them up: 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. So, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48% (2pq).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (pq), we multiply p and q together: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24, which is 24%. Wait, but hold on\u2014since the question asks specifically for heterozygotes, not the proportion of carriers. But in this case, since the recessive trait isn't expressed, the heterozygotes would actually show the dominant trait. However, the question might be asking about the actual presence or absence of the recessive allele. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about how many students actually carry the recessive allele, which would be heterozygotes, as they can't roll their tongue. Wait, no\u2014the question states that 16% can't roll, which is homozygous recessive. So, the remaining students must either be heterozygotes (who can roll their tongue) or homozygous dominant (who can also roll their tongue). But wait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, in a diploid organism, the presence of at least one dominant allele means the trait is expressed. So, any student who has at least one T allele can roll their tongue. Therefore, the number of students who are heterozygous would be the ones carrying at least one t allele, which includes both heterozygotes and homozygous dominant. But the question seems to ask for heterozygotes, which would be the count of individuals who have two different alleles. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"heterozygous,\" which refers to having one dominant and one recessive allele. So, if someone is heterozygous, they can't roll their tongue because both alleles are recessive. Therefore, the 16% who can't roll are homozygous recessive. The rest of the students, which would be 84%, either have at least one dominant allele (and thus can roll their tongue) or are homozygous dominant. Wait, no\u2014it's a bit more nuanced. The total population is 100%, so 16% are tt, meaning 84% are either TT or Tt. Out of these 84%, some are TT (homozygous dominant, can roll) and some are Tt (heterozygous, can roll). To find the percentage of heterozygotes, we need to know how many of the 84% are Tt. Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We know q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6. So, p\u00b2 = 0.36 (TT), 2pq = 0.48 (Tt), and q\u00b2 = 0.16 (tt). Adding them up: 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. So, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48% (2pq). Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 24%, but now I'm getting 48%. Let me check again. Yes, 2pq is indeed 0.48, which is 48%. So, the correct answer should be F. 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Perhaps the question is phrased differently, or there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the total number of students as fixed, and using allele counts instead of genotype percentages. Let's see: If 16% can't roll (q\u00b2=0.16), then q=0.4. Each person has two alleles, so the number of recessive alleles in the population would be 0.16*2=0.32. The remaining 0.68 would be either T or t. But since T is dominant, those without recessive alleles (i.e., TT and Tt) can roll. The heterozygotes (Tt) would be 0.68 - 0.32 (TT) = 0.36, which is 36% as per option A. But wait, no\u2014wait, that approach doesn't directly give the heterozygote count. Actually, the correct way is to calculate 2pq, which in this case is 0.48 or 48%. So unless there's a miscalculation on my part, the correct answer should be 48%, which is option F. But the initial calculation suggests that. Unless the question uses a different model, such as considering the proportion of each allele separately. Let me consider allele frequencies. Total alleles = 2N, where N is the number of students. The number of recessive alleles (q) is 0.16*N*2 = 0.32N. The number of dominant alleles (p) is 0.68N. The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.32N / 0.68N \u2248 0.47, which rounds to 0.47 or 47%, which aligns with our previous q=0.4. Similarly, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is approximately 0.53. Now, the frequency of heterozygotes is calculated as 2*(frequency of T)*(frequency of t) = 2*0.53*0.47 \u2248 0.49, which is roughly 49%, close enough to 48%.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, we can calculate the frequency of heterozygotes, which is 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Multiplying these together gives 0.48, or 48%.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, we want to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), which corresponds to 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but the options don't include 48%, though option F is 48%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. Oh, wait! No, actually, no, the calculation seems correct. But looking back at the options, F is indeed 48%. However, sometimes people confuse heterozygote frequency with another measure, but according to Hardy-Weinberg, 48% should be the right answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, the percentage of heterozygotes is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not the percentage expressing the trait.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, we're looking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), which corresponds to 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but let me double-check. 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48. So, 48% of the students are heterozygous. Looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, the rest should be either dominant or heterozygous. Wait, no\u2014hold on again. If 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% (since 100% - 16% = 84%) are either TT or Tt. But according to the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the proportion of heterozygotes is 2pq, which in this case is 48%, so 48% of the students are heterozygous, and 48% can roll their tongue (either TT or Tt). That seems correct. So, among the options, F is 48%. But wait, earlier I thought the answer might be B (32%) based on another approach. Maybe I'm confusing something. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a diploid organism, the total percentage of individuals with the dominant trait is p\u00b2 + 2pq, which would be 1 - q\u00b2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84, so 84% can roll their tongue. Then, the percentage of heterozygotes would be 2pq = 0.84 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/2. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, since 2pq is the percentage of heterozygotes, which is equal to 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48 or 48%. So, yes, 48% should be the correct answer.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, we want to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), which corresponds to 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014the options don't include 48%, unless I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check my calculations. q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = 0.4 \u2192 p = 0.6 \u2192 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 \u2192 48%. Hmm, looking back at the options provided, F is 48%. But wait, maybe I misread the question. It asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not the percentage expressing the trait. But no, since heterozygotes are exactly the ones who can roll their tongue, right? Because the question said that 16% can't roll their tongue, implying they're homozygous recessive. So, the rest should be either dominant or heterozygous. Wait, no\u2014hold on again. If 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% (since 100% - 16% = 84%) are either TT or Tt. But according to the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the proportion of heterozygotes is 2pq, which in this case is 48%, so 48% of the students are heterozygous, and 48% can roll their tongue (either TT or Tt). That seems correct. So, among the options, F is 48%. But wait, earlier I thought the answer might be B (32%) based on another approach. Maybe I'm confusing something. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a diploid organism, the total percentage of individuals with the dominant trait is p\u00b2 + 2pq, which would be 1 - q\u00b2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84, so 84% can roll their tongue. Then, the percentage of heterozygotes would be 2pq = 0.84 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/2. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, since 2pq is the percentage of heterozygotes, which is equal to 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48 or 48%. So, yes, 48% should be the correct answer. Looking back at the options, F is 48%, so the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, we need to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48% except option F. But wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. If 16% are tt, then q\u00b2=0.16 => q=0.4.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygous individuals (pq), we multiply p and q together: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24, or 24%. That makes sense because in a diploid organism, each parent contributes one allele, so half the chance of getting the dominant allele from each parent leads to a 25% chance of being homozygous dominant, 50% heterozygous, and 25% recessive homozygous. But wait, since we're dealing with a population, not just parents producing offspring, the percentages add up correctly. So, 25% dominant dominant, 50% heterozygous, and 25% recessive recessive. Given that 24% corresponds to heterozygotes, option C should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (2pq), we multiply p and q together and then double it. So, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, we get 48%. Looking back at the options provided: A.36%, B.32%, C.24%, D.40%, E.20%, F.48%, G.68%, H.16%, I.64%, J.52%, K. So, option F is 48%, which matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), we use the formula 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48%. Let me check again. Oh, wait, no\u2014the options do include F. 48 percent. So, the correct answer should be F. 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
