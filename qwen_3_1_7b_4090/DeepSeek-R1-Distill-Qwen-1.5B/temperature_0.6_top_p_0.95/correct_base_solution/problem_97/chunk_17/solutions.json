The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, the question asks for the percentage of heterozygotes. Using the formula 2pq, we substitute p = 0.6 and q = 0.4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, 0.48 * 100 = 48%. Wait, but none of the options directly say 48%, though option F is 48%. However, looking back at the options provided, option G is 68%, which seems higher than my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. If q\u00b2 is 0.16, then q is indeed 0.4, making p 0.6. Then 2pq is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%. But why is there an option F with 48%? Oh, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. Yes, option F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, the question asks for the percentage of heterozygous individuals. Using the formula 2pq, we substitute p and q. That gives us 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that, 2 times 0.6 is 1.2, multiplied by 0.4 is 0.48. So, 0.48 corresponds to 48%. Therefore, 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt). Using the equation 2pq, we substitute p and q. That would be 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let's calculate that: 2 * 0.6 is 1.2, multiplied by 0.4 gives 0.48. So, 0.48 corresponds to 48%. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, we want to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, it's 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014let me double-check that calculation. Multiplying 0.6 and 0.4 gives 0.24, and doubling that gives 0.48. Yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, another way to approach this is to consider the total number of students. Suppose there are 100 students; 16 are tt (cannot roll), so 84 are either TT or Tt. Since TT individuals would also be able to roll their tongue, and the rest are Tt. Assuming the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the ratio of TT:Tt:tt is 25:50:16, which adds up to 100.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it was 48%, which contradicts this. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me clarify. The Hardy-Weinberg principle assumes random mating, no selection against the recessive phenotype, etc. So, in reality, if the recessive trait (tt) isn't expressed, the proportion of tt individuals shouldn't affect the allele frequencies directly unless there's selection against them. However, the question states that the recessive allele fails to confer the ability, implying that the presence of even one t allele would allow the student to roll their tongue, so selection isn't an issue here.

But wait, let me double-check my math. 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48, which is correct. So, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%. That makes sense because in a diploid organism, the heterozygote should be more common than either homozygote when the dominant allele is present at a higher frequency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, we're looking for the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that gives 2 * 0.24 = 0.48, or 48%. But wait, let me double-check that. If 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. Since it's a 3:1 ratio between heterozygotes and homozygotes when p > q, but actually, the exact calculation should give 48% heterozygotes. Wait no, maybe not exactly. Let me think again. The total percentage of individuals is 100%, so 16% are tt. That leaves 84% as TT and/or Tt. Using the formula, since p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So, the answer should be 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, we want to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt). Using the formula 2pq, we substitute p = 0.6 and q = 0.4. Calculating that gives 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on a second\u2014does that make sense?

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes, we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014let me double-check that math. 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48. But wait, none of the options include 48% except option F. However, looking back at the options provided, option C is 24%, which seems off because my calculation shows 48%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through again.\n\nWait, no\u2014the equation should be correct. The total population is 100%, and the percentages add up correctly. If 16% are tt (q\u00b2=0.16 \u2192 q=0.4), then p=0.6. Then 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. But the options don't have 48%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question asks for heterozygotes, not the percentage expressing the trait. So yes, 48% should be the answer. Looking back at the options, F is 48%, so that should be the right choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, we want to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), which corresponds to the 2pq term. Plugging in the values, we get 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014let me double-check that. If q is 0.4, then p is 0.6, so 2pq is indeed 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48% of the students. Looking back at the options provided, F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The recessive phenotype occurs when an individual has two recessive alleles, so in this case, tt. Since 16% are tt, that's q\u00b2=0.16, leading to q=0.4. Then p=0.6. The heterozygous frequency is 2pq, which is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, sometimes people use another approach where if 16% are non-recessive (tt), then 100% - 16% = 84% are either heterozygous or dominant. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, which states that the proportion of each genotype is p\u00b2 : 2pq : q\u00b2, and since 16% are tt, the remaining 84% would be split between the other two genotypes. But in reality, without additional information, we can assume that the rest are either dominant or heterozygous. However, using the formula 2pq = 1 - q\u00b2 - p\u00b2.

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, we need to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), which is 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that back to a percentage, 0.48 * 100 = 48%. Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check that math. 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48, which is 48%. Hmm, but looking at the answer choices, option F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer. But wait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me think again. The recessive phenotype occurs when an individual has two recessive alleles, so in this case, tt. Since 16% are tt, that's q\u00b2=0.16, leading to q=0.4. Then p=0.6. The heterozygous frequency is 2pq, which is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, sometimes people use another approach where if 16% are non-recessive (tt), then 100% - 16% = 84% are either heterozygous or dominant. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, which states that the proportion of each genotype is p\u00b2 : 2pq : q\u00b2, and since 16% are tt, the remaining 84% would be split between the other two genotypes. But in reality, without additional information, we can assume that the rest are either dominant or heterozygous. However, using the formula 2pq = 1 - q\u00b2 - p\u00b2. Wait, no, maybe not necessary here. My initial calculation seems solid. So, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, we want to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt). Using the formula 2pq, we plug in the values we found. 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the total percentage of affected individuals. Since 16% can't roll their tongue (tt), and assuming that the rest can either roll or not based on the presence of the dominant allele, perhaps the percentage of carriers (heterozygotes) would be higher than just 48%. But no, the Hardy-Weinberg equation should give us the exact proportion. Alternatively, considering that 16% are tt, the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. Assuming random mating, the ratio of TT to Tt should be roughly 3:1. So, 75% would be TT and 25% would be Tt. That would make the heterozygote percentage 25%, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine. If q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q = 0.4, correct. Then p = 0.6. The number of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But wait, the total percentage of affected individuals (those who can't roll their tongue) is 16% (tt) plus any heterozygotes who might also show the dominant trait. No, wait, the question specifically asks for heterozygotes who fail to roll their tongue, which would only be the tt genotype. So, actually, the heterozygotes don't contribute to the inability to roll their tongue; they're carriers. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygotes among those unable to roll their tongue would be zero. But that's not the case here because the question is asking for the overall percentage of heterozygotes in the school, regardless of whether they can roll their tongue. So, going back, the answer should indeed be 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes, we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, it's 48%. So, the answer should be F, which corresponds to 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Because sometimes when calculating heterozygosity, people might refer to the combined proportion differently.

No, the question specifically asks for heterozygous, so 48% should be correct. Looking at the options, F is 48%, so that seems right.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

We know q\u00b2 = 0.16, so p\u00b2 should be (0.6)^2 = 0.36, and 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4=0.48. Adding them up: 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1.0, which checks out. So, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
