So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues.

Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, we get 48%. Wait a minute, but let me double-check. Sometimes people make mistakes with whether it's 2pq or just pq. But no, since heterozygotes are two carriers, each contributing one allele, so multiplying by 2 makes sense. Alternatively, another way to think about it is using Punnett squares. For example, if the parents were TT and tt, the possible gametes from TT are T, and from tt are t and t. So, the offspring would have Tt and tt in a 1:1 ratio. That matches our calculation of 48% heterozygotes and 16% homozygous recessives, adding up to 64%, which is correct because 1 - (q\u00b2 + 2pq) should equal p\u00b2. Wait, actually, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We know q\u00b2 is 0.16, so p\u00b2 would be (0.6)^2 = 0.36. Adding them together, 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. So that checks out. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygotes is indeed 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on a second\u2014did I do that right? Because sometimes when dealing with percentages, especially in problems where the answer might seem higher or lower than expected, it's easy to mix up whether it's 2pq or another term. Let me double-check. The total percentage should add up to 100%, so if q\u00b2 is 16%, then the remaining 84% are accounted for by the other two genotypes. But since heterozygotes don't contribute to the recessive trait, they're just part of the equation. Another way to look at it is using the formula for allele frequency. For a completely recessive phenotype, q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4, p = 0.6. Then heterozygous individuals are 2pq, which is indeed 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%. That seems correct based on the calculations. So the answer should be F. 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, it's 48%. Looking at the options provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, let me double-check. Actually, since q is the recessive frequency and p is the dominant, and we're looking for heterozygotes, which are 2pq. So yes, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 is indeed 0.48, which is 48%. But wait, the options don't include 48% yet; looking back at the choices provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the answer. Alternatively, another approach could involve calculating the total number of students. Suppose there are 100 students for simplicity. 16% cannot roll their tongue, so that's 16 students with genotype tt. The remaining 84 students are either Tt or TT. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the distribution is p\u00b2 : 2pq : q\u00b2. We know q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6, so p\u00b2 = 0.36, which is 36% of students who are TT. The heterozygotes would be 2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48% of students. Adding up, 36% (TT) + 48% (Tt) + 16% (tt) = 100%, which checks out. So yes, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele.

So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let's compute that: 2 * 0.6 is 1.2, multiplied by 0.4 gives 0.48. Converting that back to a percentage, we get 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48%, looking back at the choices provided, option F is 48 percent.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Calculating that: 2 * 0.6 = 1.2; 1.2 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to percentage, we get 48%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Another way to think about it is that the total possible percentages should add up to 100%. We have 16% homozygous recessive, and 48% heterozygous, which leaves 40% as homozygous dominant (TT). Adding them together: 16 + 48 + 40 = 104? That can't be right. Oh wait, no, I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate. If q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6.

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let's compute that: 2 * 0.6 is 1.2, and 1.2 * 0.4 is 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, it's 48%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, it's 48%. Looking at the options provided, option F is 48%, so the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, that's 48%.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let's compute that: 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, that's 48%. So, 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let's do the math: 2 * 0.6 = 1.2, and 1.2 * 0.4 = 0.48. So, 0.48 corresponds to 48% of the students being heterozygous. Wait, but let me double-check that.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.",
