    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%.",

Calculating 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But looking at the answer options, F is 48%, which should be the correct choice. However, another way to think about it is using the total percentage of non-tall (non-rolling) students, which includes both homozygous tt and heterozygous Tt. Since 16% are tt, the remaining 84% are either Tt or TT. But wait, no, the total population is 100%, so actually, the 16% is just the tt group, leaving 84% as the sum of Tt and TT. But since the question asks specifically for heterozygotes (Tt), not including TT, how do we find that? Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the class from which the sample was taken, assuming that the distribution is different. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The initial approach gave me 48%, which is option F. But wait, sometimes when people talk about the \"ability to roll the tongue,\"TT individuals might have some advantage, but according to the question, it's stated that the recessive allele doesn't confer the ability, implying that TT also don't roll their tongue. Wait, no, that contradicts the initial statement. Let me read again: \"The ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene, while its recessive allele fails to confer this ability.\" So, if someone has TT, they should have the ability, right? But the question states that 16% can't, so they're all tt. That implies that TT does have the ability, so they wouldn't fall into the 16% who can't. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify: If 16% can't roll their tongue, that's the recessive phenotype, so they must be tt. Therefore, the rest (84%) are either TT or Tt. But since TT don't show the trait, they must be part of the 84%. But the question is asking for heterozygotes (Tt), so that would be the remaining after subtracting the tt group. Wait, no, the question is directly asking for heterozygotes among the entire student body. So, if 16% are tt, and the rest (84%) are TT and Tt combined, but we're only interested in the percentage of Tt, which is 2pq. So, going back, with q=0.4, p=0.6, 2pq=0.48, which is 48%. So, the answer should be F. But wait, another thought: Maybe the question is referring to the percentage of students who are carriers (heterozygous) among those who can't roll their tongue, but that doesn't make sense because the carriers can roll their tongue. No, the question clearly asks for heterozygotes regardless of their ability to roll their tongue. So, sticking with 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014did I do that right? Because sometimes people get confused between calculating the actual number and the percentage.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, that seems off because if 16% are tt, then 84% should be TT and Tt combined. But according to my calculation, heterozygotes are 48%, which is more than half of the remaining 84%, making sense. However, looking at the options provided, option F is 48%, which matches my calculation. But wait, the initial answer I thought was 32%, but now I'm getting 48%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. q\u00b2 = 0.16 => q=0.4. Then p=0.6. 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. So the correct answer should be 48%, which is option F. But wait, the user initially thought of 32%, which might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Maybe the question is asking for something else. Oh, wait! It could also be considering the possibility that the students are randomly mating, but the question doesn't specify anything about genetic recombination or selection pressures. Also, the presence of incomplete dominance or other factors isn't mentioned. So, sticking with Hardy-Weinberg, the correct percentage is 48%, option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again. Starting from scratch: 16% cannot roll their tongue, so that's q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6. Heterozygous frequency is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that. Another way to think about it is using the total percentage. If 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% (100% - 16%) are either TT or Tt. But since the question asks specifically for heterozygotes, not any of the other genotypes, we don't need to subtract anything else. Alternatively, using the formula for heterozygotes in terms of dominance: heterozygotes are more common than homozygotes. Since the recessive phenotype is rare, the majority should be heterozygotes. So, 48% seems right. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, which matches my calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, so that should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16.

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48%, looking back at the choices provided:\n\nA. 36%\n\nB. 32%\n\nC. 24%\n\nD. 40%\n\nE. 20%\n\nF. 48%\n\nG. 68%\n\nH. 16%\n\nI. 64%\n\nJ. 52%\n\nSo, option F is 48%, which matches our calculation. But wait, earlier I thought maybe there was confusion between the percentages. Let me double-check everything. We know that q\u00b2 = 0.16 => q=0.4, so p=0.6. Then, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. That seems correct. Alternatively, sometimes people use the fact that in a population under Hardy-Weinberg, the total proportion is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We already know that q\u00b2 = 0.16, so 2pq = 1 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Calculating p\u00b2: (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 0.36 + 0.16 = 0.52. Therefore, 2pq = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48, same result. So, 48% of the students are heterozygous. Looking back at the options, F is 48%, so that should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, did I make a mistake somewhere? Because if 16% are tt, and 48% are Tt, adding up to 64%, leaving 32% as TT. But wait, the question asks specifically for heterozygotes, which should be 48% according to my calculation. However, looking at the answer choices provided, option F is 48%, which seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check. The total percentage should add up to 100%, so 16% (tt) + 48% (Tt) + 32% (TT) = 96%, which is less than 100%.

In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

Here, D = 0.75, since 75% can roll their tongue. We know that q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4, same as before. Then p = 0.6. So, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. So, yes, the heterozygous percentage is 48%. So, the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48%, looking back at the choices provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. If 16% are tt, that's 0.16, so q is sqrt(0.16)=0.4. Then p=0.6. Heterozygous is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Thus, the remaining percentage (100% - 16%) = 84% are either heterozygous or homozygous dominant. Then, using Hardy-Weinberg, since we know the homozygous recessive frequency, we can solve for the heterozygous frequency. Let me recalculate: If q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q = 0.4, p = 0.6.

Hmm, re-reading the question: \"what percentage of students are heterozygous?\" It doesn't specify a subgroup, so it's the overall heterozygous percentage. But earlier, I thought the answer was 48%, but looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%. However, the initial calculation led me to 48%, which matches option F. But wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of students who cannot roll their tongues but are heterozygous, which might complicate things. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: If 16% can't roll their tongue (tt), that's q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6. The percentage of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. So, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%. That corresponds to option F. But the options also include D as 40%, which makes me wonder if there's another way to interpret the question. Maybe the question is asking for the percentage of students who can roll their tongue but are heterozygous. Wait, no\u2014that wouldn't make sense because even heterozygotes can roll their tongue. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only those who can't roll their tongue, but that seems unlikely since the question didn't specify any subgroup. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different notation where Q is the proportion of non-recessive phenotypes, but I'm not sure. Given that the standard approach leads to 48%, which is an option, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16.

To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014let me double-check that. The total number of students should add up correctly. Homozygous dominant would be p\u00b2 = 0.36, heterozygous is 0.48, and homozygous recessive is 0.16. Adding them together: 0.36 + 0.48 = 0.84, plus 0.16 makes 1.00. That checks out. But wait, the answer options don't include 48% as correct? Hmm, looking back at the options provided: A. 36%, B. 32%, C. 24%, D. 40%, E. 20%, F. 48%, G. 68%, H. 16%, I. 64%, J. 52%, K. 16%.\n\nWait, option F is 48%, so that seems to match our calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through again. We know q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u21d2 q = 0.4 \u21d2 p = 0.6. Then, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So yes, that matches option F. But earlier I thought the answer might be 36%, but no\u2014that was using p\u00b2 instead of 2pq. Maybe I confused the formulas initially.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me re-examine my steps. Oh, wait! The 16% is the proportion of people who cannot roll their tongue, which includes both the heterozygous (Tt) and the homozygous recessive (tt) individuals. So, actually, the total percentage of non-recessive (i.e., not tt) is 100% minus the percentage of tt. That is, 100% - 16% = 84% are either TT or Tt. Now, since the question asks for the percentage of heterozygotes among all students, including those who can roll their tongue, we need to consider how much of these 84% are heterozygotes versus homozygotes.

But the answer choice F is 48%, so why am I confused? Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of heterozygotes relative to the number of students who can roll their tongue. Let me check that possibility too. The total percentage of students who can roll their tongue is 100% - 16% = 84%. Of these, some are heterozygotes and some are homozygous dominant. The ratio of heterozygotes to the total can be found using the formula (2pq)/(p\u00b2 + 2pq) = (2pq)/1 = 2pq/q\u00b2 = 2p/q. Substituting p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, we get 2*(0.6)/(0.4) = 1.2/0.4 = 3. So, 3 parts heterozygotes to 1 part homozygous recessive. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygotes among those who can roll their tongue is (3/(3+1))*84% \u2248 70.5%. But that doesn't match any of the given options, so I think the correct interpretation is that the question is asking for the overall percentage of heterozygotes in the entire student population, regardless of whether they can roll their tongue. Hence, 48% corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014let me double-check that calculation. Multiplying 0.6 by 0.4 gives 0.24, and doubling that gives 0.48, which is indeed 48%. But wait, none of the answer choices include 48%, except option F. However, looking back at the options provided, E is 20%, D is 40%, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine my steps. Oh, wait! The 16% is the proportion of people who cannot roll their tongue, which includes both the heterozygous (Tt) and the homozygous recessive (tt) individuals. So, actually, the total percentage of non-recessive (i.e., not tt) is 100% minus the percentage of tt. That is, 100% - 16% = 84% are either TT or Tt. Now, since the question asks for the percentage of heterozygotes among all students, including those who can roll their tongue, we need to consider how much of these 84% are heterozygotes versus homozygotes. Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation again, p\u00b2 + 2pq = 0.84. We already know that q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4, which makes p = 0.6. Then, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.

For example, if the recessive phenotype is not expressed, maybe the question is asking about the percentage expressing the trait, which would include both heterozygotes and homozygotes. But since the question specifically asks for heterozygotes, I think my initial calculation holds. However, another way to look at it is that the total percentage of people expressing the trait (able to roll their tongue) is 100% minus the homozygous recessive (which is 100% - 16% = 84%). Then, using the equation for expressing the trait: 2p + q = 1. But wait, that might complicate things more than necessary.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014let me double-check. Sometimes, depending on how the questions are phrased, there might be a different approach. For example, if the recessive phenotype is not expressed, maybe the question is asking about the percentage expressing the trait, which would include both heterozygotes and homozygotes. But since the question specifically asks for heterozygotes, I think my initial calculation holds. However, another way to look at it is that the total percentage of people expressing the trait (able to roll their tongue) is 100% minus the homozygous recessive (which is 100% - 16% = 84%). Then, using the equation for expressing the trait: 2p + q = 1. But wait, that might complicate things more than necessary. Alternatively, considering that the percentage of heterozygotes can be found by 2pq, which in this case is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%, which matches option F. But looking back at the options provided, I see E is 20%, D is 40%, etc., and F is 48%. So, based on my calculations, the correct answer should be F, 48%. But wait, earlier I thought the percentage of heterozygotes was 48%, but now I'm confused because I remember seeing similar problems where the percentage could be lower. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again. If q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q = 0.4, p = 0.6. Heterozygotes are 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So that seems right. Alternatively, sometimes people make the assumption that the percentage of carriers is approximately 50%, but that's an approximation. In reality, it depends on p and q. So, unless there's additional information, 48% makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Alternatively, using the fact that the number of heterozygotes is 2pq, which should be equal to the remaining percentage after subtracting the homozygous dominant and recessive from 100%. So, total percentage accounted for is 100% - q\u00b2 - p\u00b2. But since p = 1 - q, p\u00b2 = (1 - q)\u00b2. So, substituting, total accounted for is 100% - q\u00b2 - (1 - q)\u00b2. Expanding (1 - q)\u00b2 gives 1 - 2q + q\u00b2. So, substituting back, total accounted for becomes 100% - q\u00b2 - (1 - 2q + q\u00b2) = 100% - q\u00b2 -1 + 2q - q\u00b2 = 99% - 2q\u00b2 + 2q.

Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. That makes sense because heterozygotes carry one dominant and one recessive allele, allowing them to express the dominant trait.

Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.
