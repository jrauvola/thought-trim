The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. That seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again.

So, the number of students who can roll their tongue would be the sum of heterozygotes and homozygotes with T, which is 2pq + p\u00b2 = 0.48 + 0.36 = 0.84, or 84%. But the question specifically asks for heterozygotes. So, based on my calculations, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%, which corresponds to option F.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on.",

Oh no, wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through again. The total number of students is assumed to be 100% since percentages are used. 16% are tt, so 84% are either TT or Tt. Since the phenotype is dominant, everyone with at least one T will show the trait, so all 84% are either TT or Tt. The ratio of TT to Tt is determined by the Hardy-Weinberg equation. We found that q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q=0.4, and thus p=0.6. Then, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So, according to this, the percentage of heterozygotes should be 48%, which corresponds to option F. However, looking back at the user's original question, the options included F as 48%, but in the initial response, the assistant thought the answer was G, which was 68%, which seems incorrect based on the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to approach this problem, such as using the fact that the proportion of carriers (heterozygotes) plus the proportion of non-carriers (homozygous recessives) equals 100%. Since the non-carrier proportion is 16%, the carrier proportion is 100% - 16% = 84%. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the carrier frequency (heterozygote) can also be calculated using the formula 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive. From q\u00b2=0.16, q=0.4, so p=0.6. Thus, 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. Therefore, the correct answer should be 48%, corresponding to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. The options don't include 48% directly. Looking back at the options provided: A. 36%, B. 32%, C. 24%, D. 40%, E. 20%, F. 48%, G. 68%, H. 16%, I. 64%, J. 52%, K. (but there's no K here).\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. The total percentage should add up to 100%, right? So if q\u00b2 = 16% (which is 0.16), then q is indeed 0.4. Then p is 0.6. So, 2pq is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But looking at the options, F is 48%, so that seems correct. However, another way to approach this could involve calculating the actual number of people based on the percentages. Suppose there are 100 students. 16% cannot roll their tongue, so 16 are tt. The remaining 84 are either Tt or TT. Now, assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the proportion of Tt among the non-tt individuals would be calculated differently. The formula for heterozygotes from non-homozygotes is (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)/(2q(1-q))... Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since the overall frequency of T is p=0.6 and t=q=0.4, the expected heterozygote frequency is 2pq = 0.48, which is 48%. That still points to option F. But wait, let me check the math again. If q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q = 0.4, p = 0.6. So, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So, the answer should be F.48%.

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on.",
    "chunk_resampled": "That seems a bit high.",
    "rollout": " That seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Yes, q squared is 0.16, so q is indeed 0.4. Then p is 0.6. Multiplying 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 does give 0.48, which is 48%. But looking at the options provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the answer. However, sometimes people get confused between expressing dominance and calculating the percentage differently. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the percentage of heterozygotes in terms of the proportion of the population having at least one dominant allele. Let me think again. In a diploid organism, each individual has two alleles. For the trait to show, at least one dominant allele is needed. So, the probability of being heterozygous is 48%, as calculated. Alternatively, if someone thinks that since 16% is tt, then the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. But wait, no. Because in Hardy-Weinberg, the total population is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We know q\u00b2 = 0.16, so p\u00b2 + 2pq = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. But without more information, we can't directly find 2pq from just knowing q\u00b2. However, using the fact that p = 1 - q, we can substitute into the equation. So, p = 0.6, q = 0.4. Then 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So yes, that's correct.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. The question asks specifically about the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not the percentage of carriers. But in some contexts, the carrier refers to heterozygotes, which is exactly what we're calculating here. However, sometimes people refer to the carrier status differently, but in this case, since the question specifies \"heterozygous,\" our calculation seems correct. But wait, another thought: if 16% are homozygous recessive (tt), then the total number of individuals is accounted for by p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2. We know p\u00b2 = 0.16, so q\u00b2 = 0.84. Then, q = sqrt(0.84) \u2248 0.9165. Wait, that can't be right because if q is around 0.9165, then p would be 1 - 0.9165 \u2248 0.0835, leading to p\u00b2 \u2248 0.007, which is way less than 0.16. This suggests an inconsistency. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me re-examine. If 16% are homozygous recessive, then q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Thus, p = 0.6. Then, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48% of the population are heterozygotes. That makes sense. Alternatively, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of carriers (heterozygotes) is 48%, which would correspond to option F (48%). So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

Let's see, if q\u00b2 = 16%, then q is indeed 0.4, leading to p = 0.6. Then 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But wait, another way to think about it is using the fact that the total percentage of individuals with the trait (can roll tongue) is p\u00b2 + 2pq. Since p = 0.6, p\u00b2 = 0.36, and 2pq = 0.48, so together it's 0.84, which accounts for 84% of the students having the trait. The remaining 16% don't, which matches the given information.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'.

Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).

So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. The options include 48%, which is option F. However, sometimes people make mistakes when applying the equations.

However, another thought comes to mind\u2014maybe the question is asking for the percentage of individuals who are carriers (heterozygous) rather than the actual proportion of the gene pool. But no, in most cases, the term heterozygote refers specifically to having two different alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the total number of carriers relative to the total population. But according to standard Hardy-Weinberg calculations, 48% would indeed represent the heterozygous proportion. So, I think the correct answer should be F, 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, since we know the frequency of homozygotes, we can solve for p and q. We already did that earlier, leading to 48% heterozygotes. Alternatively, thinking in terms of ratios: if q\u00b2 = 16%, then q = 40%, so p = 60%. Then, the heterozygous frequency is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. That matches my previous result. So, the answer should be F, 48%. However, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think about it is that the total population can be divided into three parts: 16% tt, x% Tt, and (100 - 16 - x)% TT. Since in a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are p\u00b2 : 2pq : q\u00b2. So, substituting p=0.6 and q=0.4, we get 0.36 : 0.48 : 0.16, adding up to 100%. Therefore, the heterozygote frequency is 0.48, which is 48%. Yes, that confirms it.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check because sometimes these questions might involve different assumptions. For example, could there be incomplete dominance or any other factors? But the question states it's a simple dominant-recessive system without such complexities. Also, since the question asks specifically about heterozygotes, and we calculated 48%, looking at the options provided, F is 48%. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating 2pq. Let me recalculate: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24, times 2 is indeed 0.48, or 48%. So yes, option F should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

But why is there an option for 20% or 36%? Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of heterozygotes relative to the total population.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. The options don't include 48%, looking back at the choices provided: A.36, B.32, C.24, D.40, E.20, F.48, G.68, H.16, I.64, J.52, K. etc. So, option F is 48%. But wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on.",
