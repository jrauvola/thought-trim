The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

Actually, in Hardy-Weinberg, the genotype frequencies are p\u00b2, 2pq, and q\u00b2. If 16% are tt (q\u00b2=0.16), then q=0.4, p=0.6. Thus, the heterozygous frequency is 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48, or 48%. But none of the options seem to match 48%. Wait, looking again, option F is 48%, which matches my calculation. So, the answer should be F.48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense. Then the heterozygote is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. That seems correct. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, so that should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense. Then the heterozygote is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. That seems correct. So looking at the options provided: A is 36%, B is 32%, C is 24%, D is 40%, E is 20%, F is 48%, G is 68%, H is 16%, I is 64%, J is 52%, K is 68%, L is 16%. So F is 48%, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the answer should be option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues.

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense. Then the heterozygote is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. That seems correct. So looking at the options provided, F is 48%, which should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
