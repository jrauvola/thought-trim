Heterozygotes are people who have one copy of each allele\u2014so they're carriers and can roll their tongue. But wait, how do we figure out how many of them there are based on the information given?\n\nIn Mendelian inheritance, when both parents are heterozygotes (Aa), all offspring have a 25% chance of being AA (homozygous dominant), 50% Aa (heterozygous), and 25% aa (homozygous recessive).

The remaining 84% must be either AA or Aa. Now, the total number of individuals is 100%, so 84% are AA or Aa.\n\nBut without knowing the genotype frequencies, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to estimate the frequency of heterozygotes. The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (A), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (a).\n\nSince the students can't roll their tongue (aa), q\u00b2 equals 0.16. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4. Therefore, p = 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nUsing these values, the frequency of heterozygotes (2pq) is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that. If 16% are aa, then the sum of AA and Aa should be 84%. Using the equation, 2pq + p\u00b2 = 1 - q\u00b2 = 0.84.

Since those who can't must be homozygous recessives (because if they had any dominant allele, they could roll their tongue), we can figure out how many people are homozygous recessive.\n\nLet me denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. So, someone who can't roll their tongue would have genotype 'tt'. The frequency of this genotype is given as 16%, which is 0.16 in decimal form.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are calculated using p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive. Here, since all individuals without the dominant allele show the recessive phenotype, p\u00b2 = 0.16. To find p, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means the frequency of the dominant allele (T) is 0.4 or 40%.\n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous means having one dominant and one recessive allele (Tt). In the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq. We already know p is 0.4, but we need to find q first. Since p + q = 1, q = 1 - p = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nPlugging these into the formula: 2pq = 2 * 0.4 * 0.6. Let's calculate that. 0.4 times 0.6 is 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key point they're giving us is that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since those who can't must be homozygous recessives (because if they had any dominant allele, they could roll their tongue), we can figure out how many people are homozygous recessive.\n\nLet me denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. So, someone who can't roll their tongue would have genotype 'tt'. The frequency of this genotype is given as 16%, which is 0.16 in decimal form.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are calculated using p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive. Here, since all individuals without the dominant allele show the recessive phenotype, p\u00b2 = 0.16. To find p, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means the frequency of the dominant allele (T) is 0.4 or 40%.\n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous means having one dominant and one recessive allele (Tt). In the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq. We already know p is 0.4, but we need to find q first. Since p + q = 1, q = 1 - p = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nPlugging these into the formula: 2pq = 2 * 0.4 * 0.6. Let's calculate that. 0.4 times 0.6 is 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48. So, 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 16% are tt and 48% are Tt, then the total accounted for is 16% + 48% = 64%. The remaining 36% should be TT, right? And indeed, p\u00b2 is 0.16, pq is 0.24, and q\u00b2 is 0.36. Adding them up: 0.16 + 0.24 + 0.36 equals exactly 0.76, which makes sense because the sum of all probabilities should equal 100%.

(None)\n\nThere's no option for 50%, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the calculations. \n\nWe know that 16% (q\u00b2) = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then p = 1 - q = 0.6. The frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa) is 2pq, which is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. Hmm, maybe I confused something earlier. \n\nWait, let me clarify: The question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not the percentage of the phenotype. So, using the formula, the proportion of heterozygotes is 2pq, which is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, so 48% of the students are heterozygous. That matches option F: 48%. \n\nSo, initially, I thought 50%, but upon recalculating, it's 48%. Maybe I was mistaken in thinking that the percentage of AA was 25%, but actually, the percentage of Aa is 48%, making the total percentage of individuals who can roll their tongue as AA (25%) + Aa (48%) = 73%, and aa (25%) = 25%. That adds up to 98%, but considering dominance, the actual phenotypic ratio is 3:1, which is 75% vs. 25%. There might be an inconsistency here, but since the question focuses on the heterozygous percentage, the correct approach is to use 2pq, leading to 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

In other words, both copies of their gene for tongue rolling aren't functional\u2014they're just not there to express the trait. So, each student who can't roll their tongue has two recessive alleles.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant allele and one recessive allele. So, these students would be carriers of the tongue-rolling gene but wouldn't show the trait themselves because they have one dominant and one recessive copy.\n\nTo find out how many students are heterozygous, we can use some basic Punnett square calculations. Let's denote the dominant allele as 'D' and the recessive as 'd'. The genotype for someone who can't roll their tongue is 'dd', which corresponds to the 16% given. That means 16% of the population is 'dd'.\n\nIn a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium situation, which applies here since there's no mention of any evolutionary forces changing allele frequencies, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated using the formula p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince q\u00b2 equals the proportion of homozygous recessives (the ones who can't roll), and we know q\u00b2 is 16%, then q must be the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4 or 40%. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1 - q, which is 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Dd), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on, let me double-check that because sometimes I mix up the terms.

Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe I misapplied the formula. Let's assume that the frequency of 'dd' is 16%, which is q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48, which is 48%. Hmm, so why did the initial response say 32%? Oh, perhaps I confused the scenario.

If 16% are unable to roll their tongue, meaning they are homozygous recessive, then the remaining 84% are either heterozygous or dominant dominant. To find the heterozygote percentage, we need to consider the distribution between DD and Dd. However, without additional information, we can't determine exactly how much of the remaining 84% are heterozygotes. Therefore, the maximum possible percentage of heterozygotes would occur if as many as possible of the remaining are heterozygous, leaving the minimum for DD.

Maybe the question assumes that the rest are heterozygous, making the percentage 84%, but that's not among the options.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key point here is that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since they can't, those must be homozygous recessive individuals. In other words, both copies of their gene for tongue rolling aren't functional\u2014they're just not there to express the trait. So, each student who can't roll their tongue has two recessive alleles.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant allele and one recessive allele. So, these students would be carriers of the tongue-rolling gene but wouldn't show the trait themselves because they have one dominant and one recessive copy.\n\nTo find out how many students are heterozygous, we can use some basic Punnett square calculations. Let's denote the dominant allele as 'D' and the recessive as 'd'. The genotype for someone who can't roll their tongue is 'dd', which corresponds to the 16% given. That means 16% of the population is 'dd'.\n\nIn a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium situation, which applies here since there's no mention of any evolutionary forces changing allele frequencies, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated using the formula p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince q\u00b2 equals the proportion of homozygous recessives (the ones who can't roll), and we know q\u00b2 is 16%, then q must be the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4 or 40%. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1 - q, which is 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Dd), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on, let me double-check that because sometimes I mix up the terms. Actually, 2pq should give us the correct number here. So yes, 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which translates to 48%. But wait, the options don't include 48% yet\u2014it does, option F. However, looking back at my initial thought, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again.\n\nWait, no\u2014the calculation seems right. The total percentage of heterozygotes should indeed be 48%. But let me think about another approach. Another way is to realize that the sum of all genotypes plus the phenotype should equal 100%. We know that 16% are 'dd'. Then, the remaining 84% (100% - 16%) are either 'DD' or 'Dd'. In a diploid organism, the ratio of 'DD': 'Dd': 'dd' depends on the allele frequencies. Alternatively, knowing that q\u00b2 is 16%, so q is 0.4, p is 0.6. Then, the frequency of 'Dd' is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nNow, the problem states that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues. That means those 16% must be homozygous for the recessive allele because only recessive homozygotes show no trait. In Punnett squares, when both alleles are recessive (aa), the offspring don't show the trait.\n\nSo, we know that the frequency of the aa genotype is 16%, which translates to q squared equaling 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which gives us 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (A) is p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nThe next part of the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele (Aa). In a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of Aa is calculated as 2pq. Plugging in the values, we get 2 * 0.6 * 0.4.\n\nLet me do the math: 0.6 multiplied by 0.4 is 0.24, and then multiplying by 2 gives 0.48 or 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that. Oh, wait! Actually, no, that calculation isn't correct because 2pq already accounts for both Aa and aa. But since we're specifically looking for heterozygous, it should just be 2pq without considering aa. Hmm, maybe I confused myself there.\n\nWait, no, the total percentage of all genotypes would add up to 100%. We know that aa is 16%, so the remaining 84% must be AA and Aa combined. Since the distribution follows a ratio of 1:A:A (where A is heterozygous), the proportion of Aa should be twice the proportion of AA. Alternatively, using the formula 2pq, where p=0.6 and q=0.4, 2*0.6*0.4 equals 0.48, which is 48%. So, that seems right.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\nA. 36%\nB. 32%\nC. 24%\nD. 40%\nE. 20%\nF. 48%\nG. 68%\nH. 16%\nI. 64%\nJ. 52%\nK.

Therefore, q = 0.4.\n\nKnowing that p + q = 1 (since all alleles sum up to 100%), I can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Thus, p = 0.6, meaning there's a 60% chance of having the dominant allele.\n\nNext, I need to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr). According to the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq. Plugging in the values, that becomes 2 * 0.6 * 0.4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key point here is that 16% of the students in the school cannot roll their tongues. Since this is recessive, those 16% must be homozygous for the recessive allele. In other words, they have two copies of the non-resembling gene (let's call them 'r'), making them unable to roll their tongues. So, each of these students has the genotype 'rr'.\n\nNow, the question asks what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means having one dominant allele ('R') and one recessive allele ('r'). So, the genotype would be 'Rr'. \n\nTo find out how many students are heterozygous, I need to use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. That principle helps calculate allele frequencies and genotype frequencies under certain assumptions like no selection, mutation, genetic drift, or migration. Here, we're assuming no such factors, which should make the calculations straightforward.\n\nLet me denote:\n- p = frequency of the dominant allele (R)\n- q = frequency of the recessive allele (r)\n\nSince the recessive phenotype is expressed when both alleles are recessive (i.e., 'rr' in this case), the frequency of the recessive phenotype (q\u00b2) is given as 16%. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which equals 0.4. Therefore, q = 0.4.\n\nKnowing that p + q = 1 (since all alleles sum up to 100%), I can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Thus, p = 0.6, meaning there's a 60% chance of having the dominant allele.\n\nNext, I need to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr). According to the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq. Plugging in the values, that becomes 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that gives 2 * 0.24 = 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my math. 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48.

Since 16% are homozygous recessives, adding the percentages together (homozygous R\u00b2: p\u00b2=0.36, heterozygous: 0.48, homozygous rr: 0.16) should add up to 100%, confirming that 36+48+16=100%.

The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince 16% of the students are aa (homozygous recessive), that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.4 or 40%.\n\nKnowing that p + q = 1, I can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%. This tells me that the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 60%, and the recessive allele (q) is 40%.\n\nNext, I need to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Aa). Using the formula 2pq, I plug in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that, 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, and then multiplying by 2 gives me 0.48. So, the frequency of heterozygotes is 48%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 40% have aa and 60% have Aa, adding them up should give me the total percentage of people who can roll their tongue. So, 40% + 60% = 100%, which makes sense. Therefore, the remaining 60% (100% - 40%) are either AA or Aa. But since we know that the majority of the population has the dominant allele, it's more likely that most are AA, but the exact distribution depends on the calculation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Aa) is 48%. Looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Heterozygous means they have one dominant allele (Dd) and one recessive allele (dd). Since the students who cannot roll their tongue are all homozygous recessive (dd), we need to figure out how many are heterozygotes among those who don't show the trait.\n\nLet's denote the frequency of the dominant allele as p and the recessive as q. Since it's a simple Mendelian scenario, p + q = 1. Also, since the trait is dominant, carriers will express the trait unless they're homozygous recessive. \n\nGiven that 16% cannot roll their tongue, which is q\u00b2 (because q is the frequency of the recessive allele, and when squared, it gives the proportion of homozygous recessives). So:\n\nq\u00b2 = 0.16  \nTaking square roots on both sides:  \nq = \u221a0.16 = 0.4  \n\nSo the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.4, meaning the dominant allele (p) would be 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNext, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Dd), we use the formula 2pq.

The question is asking for heterozygotes among those who cannot roll their tongue. Wait no, actually, the question is just asking for the overall percentage of heterozygotes in the population. Because the inability to roll the tongue refers to the phenotype, not the genotype. So regardless of whether someone can roll their tongue or not, the question is about the genetic makeup.\n\nBut let me make sure. The problem states that 16% cannot roll their tongue, which corresponds to the homozygous recessive (dd) individuals. The question then wants to know what percentage of the students are heterozygous (Dd). But wait, in reality, all heterozygotes will show the dominant trait (can roll their tongue), right? So in terms of the school population, the 16% who cannot roll their tongue are all dd, and the rest (84%) are either Dd or DD. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygotes (Dd) would be part of the remaining 84%.\n\nHowever, the way the question is phrased might mean that we should consider only the students who cannot roll their tongue, but that doesn't seem correct because the question is general about the entire student body. It's more likely that the 16% refers to the entire population, so we calculate the percentage of heterozygotes in the population.\n\nTherefore, using the Hardy-Weinberg equations, we found that the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which matches option F.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 2pq was 48%, but looking at the options, F is 48%. However, another approach could be considering the total number of students. Let's suppose there are N students. 16% (0.16N) cannot roll their tongue, so that's the number of dd individuals. The remaining 84% (0.84N) are either Dd or DD. In a diploid organism, each individual has two alleles. So the number of heterozygotes would depend on the distribution between Dd and DD.\n\nIn a randomly mating population under Hardy-Weinberg, the genotype frequencies are p\u00b2 (DD), 2pq (Dd), and q\u00b2 (dd). Here, p=0.6 and q=0.4. So the number of Dd individuals would be 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48% of the population.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key point is that 16% of the students can't roll their tongue. Since the recessive phenotype isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. That means each student has two copies of the recessive allele. Now, we're supposed to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygous\u2014meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nI remember from my biology class that for such problems, we usually use the Hardy-Weinberg equations. They help calculate genotype frequencies based on allele frequencies. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the other. In this case, since the recessive trait isn't expressed in 16%, which would be q\u00b2, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\nq\u00b2 = 0.16\n\nTo find q, we take the square root of 0.16. Let me think... sqrt(0.16) is 0.4 because 0.4 * 0.4 equals 0.16. So, q is 0.4.\n\nSince p + q = 1, we can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48\n\nSo, 0.48 corresponds to 48%. Wait, let me double-check that math. 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, and doubling that gives 0.48. Yep, that checks out.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option F is 48 percent, which matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Heterozygous means having two different alleles, right? So, the genotype would be Aa. But wait, since rolling the tongue is dominant, the presence of at least one dominant allele (A) will allow someone to roll their tongue. If both alleles are recessive (aa), then they don't show the trait.\n\nSo, if we're looking at a population where 16% are aa, which is the homozygous recessive state, we need to figure out how many people are Aa. Since the disease is dominant, any person who has at least one dominant allele (A or Aa) will show the trait. So, the remaining percentage of students should be those who are either AA (homozygous dominant) or Aa (heterozygous).\n\nLet me think about the Hardy-Weinberg principle here. It states that in a large, randomly mating population, the allele frequencies remain constant from generation to generation when certain conditions are met, such as no mutation, no genetic drift, no migration, and random mating. However, since the problem doesn't mention any mutations or selection against the dominant allele, maybe we can assume that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg terms, the equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (A) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (a). Here, q\u00b2 would represent the proportion of individuals who are aa, which is given as 16%. So, q squared equals 0.16.\n\nTo find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.4, meaning the dominant allele (p) would be 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nNow, using the Hardy-Weinberg formula again, p squared plus 2pq plus q squared equals 1. We know q squared is 0.16, and now we can calculate the total number of heterozygotes (which is 2pq). Plugging in the numbers:\n\nFirst, p is 0.6 and q is 0.4.\nSo, 2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48.\n\nTherefore, 48% of the students are heterozygous (Aa). Wait, but let me double-check.

But actually, calculating 2pq from q\u00b2 might be more straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a simpler way. If q\u00b2 is 0.16, then q is 0.4. Then, p is 0.6. The frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So, option F is 48%.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Another way to think about it is that in a population where 16% are aa, the frequency of carriers (heterozygotes) is twice the frequency of the aa individuals. Because each aa individual contributes to two carriers when crossed. So, 16% times 2 is 32%, but that seems contradictory. Wait, that doesn't align with the earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let's reconsider. Each aa individual can produce gametes with either allele, but when crossing with others, the probability of producing a carrier depends on the frequency of the alleles. Alternatively, using the formula, the frequency of carriers is 2pq. Since q\u00b2 is 0.16, q is 0.4, so p is 0.6. Thus, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So, that confirms it.\n\nWait, but another thought: if 16% are aa, then the remaining 84% are AA and Aa combined. The ratio between AA and Aa is determined by the allele frequencies. In Hardy-Weinberg, the proportion of AA is p\u00b2, which is (0.6)^2=0.36, or 36%, and Aa is 2pq=0.48, or 48%. So, 36% AA and 48% Aa, totaling 84%.

In other words, both copies of their DNA carry that recessive gene. So, each student who can't roll has two copies of the recessive allele.\n\nNow, we're asked what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means having one copy of the dominant allele and one copy of the recessive allele. So, these students would be carriers of the trait\u2014they can roll their tongue but don't show it completely.\n\nTo solve this, I'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps calculate allele frequencies and genotype ratios in a population under certain assumptions. The formula for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where:\n- p\u00b2 is the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals,\n- 2pq is the frequency of heterozygous individuals,\n- q\u00b2 is the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals.\n\nIn this case, since 16% can't roll their tongue (q\u00b2), we know that q is the square root of 0.16. Calculating that, sqrt(0.16) equals 0.4, so q is 0.4. That makes sense because 0.4 squared is 0.16.\n\nNext, we need to find the frequency of the dominant allele (p). We know that p + q = 1, so p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. This means p is 0.6, or 60%.\n\nNow, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, we can plug these values into the formula. However, instead of calculating all three terms, since we're looking for the heterozygous proportion (2pq), let's compute that directly.\n\nSo, 2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key point here is that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since they can't, that means they must be homozygous for the recessive allele. In other words, both copies of their DNA carry that recessive gene. So, each student who can't roll has two copies of the recessive allele.\n\nNow, we're asked what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means having one copy of the dominant allele and one copy of the recessive allele. So, these students would be carriers of the trait\u2014they can roll their tongue but don't show it completely.\n\nTo solve this, I'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps calculate allele frequencies and genotype ratios in a population under certain assumptions. The formula for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where:\n- p\u00b2 is the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals,\n- 2pq is the frequency of heterozygous individuals,\n- q\u00b2 is the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals.\n\nIn this case, since 16% can't roll their tongue (q\u00b2), we know that q is the square root of 0.16. Calculating that, sqrt(0.16) equals 0.4, so q is 0.4. That makes sense because 0.4 squared is 0.16.\n\nNext, we need to find the frequency of the dominant allele (p). We know that p + q = 1, so p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. This means p is 0.6, or 60%.\n\nNow, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, we can plug these values into the formula. However, instead of calculating all three terms, since we're looking for the heterozygous proportion (2pq), let's compute that directly.\n\nSo, 2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Multiplying those together gives us 0.48, and then multiplying by 2 gives 0.96. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, resulting in 96%. Wait, that seems high. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. If q\u00b2 is 0.16, then q is indeed 0.4. Then p is 0.6. Plugging into 2pq: 2*0.6=1.2; 1.2*0.4=0.48, which is 48%.

Adding them up: 36 + 48 + 16 = 100%, which checks out. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the frequency of the recessive allele, and p\u00b2, 2pq, and q\u00b2 represent the frequencies of the genotypes AA, Aa, and aa respectively.\n\nSince 16% of the students can't roll their tongue, that's the q\u00b2 term. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which gives me q = 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the recessive allele is 40%.\n\nKnowing that, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, the frequency of the heterozygous individuals (Aa) is given by 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that, 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, multiplied by 2 gives 0.48. \n\nSo, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%. Looking back at the options provided, F corresponds to 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, if someone can't roll their tongue, their genotype is aa, right? Because AA would mean they can roll.\n\nNow, the question asks what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one allele of each type, so their genotype would be Aa. But wait, in this case, since they can't roll their tongue, they don't have the dominant allele A. Wait no, hold on. If they're unable to roll their tongue, that means they have two recessive alleles. So all the students who can't roll are aa. The rest must be either AA or Aa.

So actually, any student who has at least one dominant allele (either AA or Aa) can roll, whereas those who are aa cannot.\n\nSo, the total percentage who can roll is 100% minus the 16% who can't.

    "rollout": " \n\nThe key information given is that 16% of the students in a school cannot roll their tongues. I need to find out what percentage of these students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic concepts. In Mendelian genetics, when two people mate, each has two copies of the gene\u2014one from each parent. For a dominant allele (let's say 'R' for rolling), if at least one copy is R, the person can roll their tongue. A recessive allele ('r') would make them unable to roll, meaning both copies must be r.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for someone who can't roll their tongue are:\n\n- rr (homozygous recessive)\n- Rr (heterozygous)\n\nSince 16% of the students can't roll, that means 16% have the genotype rr. Now, we want to find the percentage that are heterozygotes (Rr). To do this, I think we'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps predict allele frequencies in a population under certain conditions\u2014like no selection, mutation, genetic drift, or migration.\n\nUnder Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated as p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r).\n\nIn this case:\n- The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (rr) is 16%, which equals q\u00b2.\n- We need to find q first.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key information given is that 16% of the students in a school cannot roll their tongues. I need to find out what percentage of these students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic concepts. In Mendelian genetics, when two people mate, each has two copies of the gene\u2014one from each parent. For a dominant allele (let's say 'R' for rolling), if at least one copy is R, the person can roll their tongue. A recessive allele ('r') would make them unable to roll, meaning both copies must be r.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for someone who can't roll their tongue are:\n\n- rr (homozygous recessive)\n- Rr (heterozygous)\n\nSince 16% of the students can't roll, that means 16% have the genotype rr. Now, we want to find the percentage that are heterozygotes (Rr). To do this, I think we'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps predict allele frequencies in a population under certain conditions\u2014like no selection, mutation, genetic drift, or migration.\n\nUnder Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated as p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (r).\n\nIn this case:\n- The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (rr) is 16%, which equals q\u00b2.\n- We need to find q first. Since q\u00b2 = 0.16, taking the square root gives q = \u221a0.16 = 0.4. That makes sense because 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16, so q is 40%.\n\nNow, knowing that q = 0.4, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, the frequency of the dominant allele (R) is 60%.\n\nNext, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Rr), which is 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe problem states that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since they're unable to roll, they must be homozygous for the recessive allele. In genetics terms, that means both copies of the gene aren't functional. So, each student who can't roll has two recessive alleles.\n\nNow, the question asks what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant allele and one recessive allele. So, we need to find out how many students have one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nLet me recall the Hardy-Weinberg principle which might help here. It states that in a large, randomly mating population, the allele frequencies remain constant from generation to generation unless certain factors change them. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of one allele, q the other, and p\u00b2, 2pq, q\u00b2 represent the genotype frequencies.\n\nIn this case, since the trait is determined by a single dominant-recessive pair, let's denote the dominant allele as A and the recessive as a. So, AA would be able to roll the tongue, Aa would also be able to, and aa wouldn't. The frequency of aa is given as 16%, which is q\u00b2. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16.\n\nTo find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele (a) is 40%. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (A) is p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNext, we need to find the percentage of heterozygotes (Aa). Using the formula 2pq, where p is 0.6 and q is 0.4:\n\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48.\n\nSo, 0.48 corresponds to 48% of the students being heterozygous. Checking the options provided, option F is 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

In Punnett squares or genetic terms, the genotype for the recessive trait is written as aa. So, the frequency of aa is 16%, which is 0.16.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous would mean they have one dominant (A) and one recessive (a) allele, so their genotype is Aa. Since both parents must contribute either an A or an a allele, there are four possible combinations when two individuals mate:\n\n1. AA (homozygous dominant)\n2. Aa (heterozygous)\n3. Aa (another possibility, but same as above)\n4. aa (homozygous recessive)\n\nIn terms of probabilities, the chance of each genotype from a cross is based on the square of the allele frequencies. But wait, we're dealing with a population, not a specific cross. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium because the problem doesn't specify any other factors like dominance ratios beyond the dominant gene conferring the trait.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg, the genotype frequencies are p\u00b2 for AA, 2pq for Aa, and q\u00b2 for aa, where p + q = 1. Here, q represents the frequency of the recessive allele 'a', and p is the dominant allele 'A'. \n\nSince we know that 16% (q\u00b2) of the students are aa, we can find q first.

For a trait with two alleles (let's say A for dominant and a for recessive), the probability of an individual having the dominant phenotype (AA or Aa) is given by p\u00b2 + 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Conversely, the probability of having the recessive phenotype (aa) is q\u00b2.\n\nGiven that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues, these are aa individuals. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, q = 0.4.\n\nSince the sum of p and q equals 1 (because there are only two alleles), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6.\n\nNow, the percentage of heterozygotes (Aa) would be calculated using 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, since the total percentage of all phenotypes should add up to 100%, I can calculate each part:\n\n- Dominant (AA + Aa): p\u00b2 + 2pq = 0.36 + 0.48 = 0.84 or 84%\n- Recessive (aa): q\u00b2 = 0.16 or 16%\n\nAdding them together, 84% + 16% = 100%, which checks out. So, the percentage of heterozygotes is indeed 48%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided: A. 36, B.32, C.24, D.40, E.20, F.48, G.68, H.16, I.64, J.52, K.68, L.16, M.40, N.64, O.16, P.48. Wait, actually, looking again, the letters go up to O, but maybe the user made a typo. But regardless, option F is 48%, which matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those who can't roll must have two recessive alleles. That means they're homozygous recessive. But we need to find out what percentage are heterozygotes\u2014students who have one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nSo, let's think about the Punnett square for a diploid genotype. Each parent contributes one allele, and since there are two genes involved, each parent has two copies of the same gene, making them diploid. For simplicity, let's assume the dominant allele is 'T' and the recessive is 't'. Therefore, the genotypes would be TT, Tt, or tt.\n\nThe total population is 100%, and 16% don't have the trait, which corresponds to the tt genotype. In a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the tt genotype is q\u00b2, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele (tt). So, q\u00b2 = 16% implies q = sqrt(16%) = 4%. That means the recessive allele (t) makes up 4% of the population.\n\nSince the total population is 100%, the remaining 96% must be the TT and Tt genotypes combined. Now, to find the number of heterozygotes (Tt), we can use the fact that in a diploid organism, the sum of the frequencies of all genotypes equals 100%. We know that TT + Tt + tt = 100%. We already have tt as 16%.\n\nTo find the frequency of TT and Tt together, it's 100% - 16% = 84%. Now, in a case where the phenotype is dominant, the heterozygote will show the dominant trait, but the presence of both alleles affects how frequently each genotype appears. However, without information on dominance ratios, we can make an assumption based on the given data.\n\nWait, actually, the problem might not require us to calculate the exact proportion of heterozygotes unless specified otherwise. But perhaps we can infer it from the given percentages. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for heterozygosity.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the probability of being a heterozygote (Tt) can be calculated as (2pq)/(p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2). Wait, no, that's for calculating the actual probabilities. Let me clarify:\n\nIn a diploid population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the expected genotype frequencies are p\u00b2 (TT), 2pq (Tt), and q\u00b2 (tt). Given that q\u00b2 = 16%, so q = 4%, then p = 96%. Therefore, the frequency of Tt (heterozygotes) is 2pq = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 0.0768 or 7.68%. But wait, that's about 8%, which isn't an option here. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the question assumes that the only possible phenotypic classes are TT and Tt, with tt being non-phenotypic. Then, the proportion of heterozygotes would be the remaining after accounting for the tt class. Since 16% are tt, the rest 84% are either TT or Tt. Without further info, perhaps the question expects us to consider that in such cases, the majority of the population falls into the dominant phenotype, so the heterozygotes could be a certain percentage.\n\nBut looking back, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: since the recessive homozygotes are 16%, the heterozygotes would be (total - heterozygotes - homozygotes). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the total is 100%, so if we have 16% homozygotes (tt), then the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. Assuming that in a typical Hardy-Weinberg scenario, the proportion of heterozygotes is often around 30-40% depending on dominance, but perhaps in this case, since we're dealing with a specific calculation, it might be more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge of genotype frequencies. Since q\u00b2 = 16%, q=4%, so p=96%. Then, the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt) is 2pq = 2*0.96*0.04 = 0.0768, which is approximately 7.68%, but none of the options match that exactly. Wait, but the options include numbers like 32% and 36%, which are much higher than 7.68%. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. It says 16% cannot roll their tongue, meaning they have the recessive allele. But perhaps it's considering the total population. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\n\"Problem: The ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene, while its recessive allele fails to convey this ability. If 16% of the students in a school cannot roll their tongues, what percentage of students are heterozygous?\"\n\nAh, so the 16% are the ones who cannot roll, i.e., they are homozygous recessive (tt). Therefore, the remaining 84% are either homozygous dominant (TT) or heterozygous (Tt).\n\nAssuming Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq, which is 2*(0.96)*(0.04)=0.0768 or 7.68%. But again, this isn't among the answer choices. So perhaps the question is expecting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that the students are divided between those who can roll (either TT or Tt) and those who cannot (tt). So, since 16% cannot, the rest 84% are either TT or Tt. To find the heterozygotes, perhaps we can express it as follows:\n\nLet x be the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and y be the frequency of the recessive allele (t). Since the recessive phenotype is non-phenotypic, we have y\u00b2 = 0.16 => y=0.4. Then, x=1-y=0.6.\n\nThe frequency of heterozygotes (Tt) is 2xy = 2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%. Wait, but that's 48%, which is one of the options (option F). But hold on, does that mean 48% are heterozygotes? Or am I confusing something?\n\nWait, no, because in the total population, the percentage of students who can roll their tongue is 84% (TT + Tt), and the percentage who cannot is 16% (tt). The heterozygotes are part of the 84% who can roll. So, according to the calculations, 48% of the population are heterozygotes.

Since the recessive phenotype is aa, which occurs at 16%, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, q = 0.4.\n\nSince p + q = 1 (because all possible alleles add up to 100%), p must be 1 - q, which is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by the term 2pq in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals... let me calculate that. 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48. That means 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 36%\nB. 32%\nC. 24%\nD. 40%\nE. 20%\nF. 48%\nG. 68%\nH. 16%\nI. 64%\nJ. 52%\nK. None of the above\n\nOption F is 48%, which matches my calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

But according to the earlier method, 2pq was 0.48, which would mean 48% heterozygotes. This discrepancy suggests an error in reasoning somewhere. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the Hardy-Weinberg formula.

Since q\u00b2 is 16%, 2pq would be 84% - 16% = 68%. So, 2pq = 68%, meaning pq = 34%. Since p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, pq = 0.24, so 2pq is 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, this aligns with the initial calculation. So why did I get 24% earlier when I thought 2pq was 0.48? Oh, I see\u2014it's 2pq, not pq alone.

But since 2pq plus q\u00b2 equals the total proportion of students with at least one dominant allele, which should be 100%, right? Because everyone has at least one dominant allele or none. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, some people might have more than one dominant allele, but in this case, it's binary\u2014either dominant or recessive. So, the total percentage of students who can roll their tongue is 100% minus 16% = 84%. So, 84% = 2pq + q\u00b2. We already know q\u00b2 is 16%, so 2pq = 84% - 16% = 68%. Therefore, pq = 34%. But earlier, I found that p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, so pq would indeed be 0.6*0.4=0.24, which is 24%. Hmm, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. When calculating the percentage of heterozygotes, it's actually pq multiplied by 100. From p=0.6 and q=0.4, pq=0.24, so 24% heterozygotes. But according to the earlier method, 2pq was 0.48, which would mean 48% heterozygotes. This discrepancy suggests an error in reasoning somewhere. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the Hardy-Weinberg formula. Let me recall: in HW equilibrium, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. Here, p\u00b2 represents the percentage of homozygous dominant individuals, 2pq is heterozygotes, and q\u00b2 is homozygous recessive. Since q\u00b2 is 16%, 2pq would be 84% - 16% = 68%. So, 2pq = 68%, meaning pq = 34%. Since p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, pq = 0.24, so 2pq is 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, this aligns with the initial calculation. So why did I get 24% earlier when I thought 2pq was 0.48? Oh, I see\u2014it's 2pq, not pq alone. So, 2pq = 0.48, which is 48% heterozygotes. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So, heterozygotes (with one dominant and one recessive allele) should still be able to roll their tongue because they have the dominant allele.

So, the genotype would be TT or Tt for those who can roll their tongue, and tt for those who can't.\n\nThe key here is understanding the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that allele frequencies remain constant from generation to generation in a large, randomly mating population. But since we don't know the total population size, maybe I'll just work with percentages.\n\nGiven that 16% of students can't roll their tongues, that means they all have the tt genotype. So, the frequency of the recessive allele (t) squared equals the proportion of individuals with the tt genotype. Mathematically, that's t\u00b2 = 16%, which means t = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 or 40%. Wait, but hold on\u2014this might not directly help because we're looking for heterozygotes, not just homozygotes.\n\nWait, no, actually, the recessive phenotype occurs when an individual has two recessive alleles. In this case, t\u00b2 = 0.16, so t = 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (T) must be 1 - t = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNow, the Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of one allele (let's say T), q is the other (t).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThey tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since they're asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, I need to figure out how many are carrying both alleles\u2014one dominant and one recessive.\n\nFirst, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. So, the genotype would be TT or Tt for those who can roll their tongue, and tt for those who can't.\n\nThe key here is understanding the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that allele frequencies remain constant from generation to generation in a large, randomly mating population. But since we don't know the total population size, maybe I'll just work with percentages.\n\nGiven that 16% of students can't roll their tongues, that means they all have the tt genotype. So, the frequency of the recessive allele (t) squared equals the proportion of individuals with the tt genotype. Mathematically, that's t\u00b2 = 16%, which means t = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4 or 40%. Wait, but hold on\u2014this might not directly help because we're looking for heterozygotes, not just homozygotes.\n\nWait, no, actually, the recessive phenotype occurs when an individual has two recessive alleles. In this case, t\u00b2 = 0.16, so t = 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (T) must be 1 - t = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNow, the Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of one allele (let's say T), q is the other (t). Here, q\u00b2 represents the proportion of individuals with the recessive phenotype (tt), which is 0.16. We already used that to find q = 0.4.\n\nNext, we want to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), which is represented by 2pq. Since p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, plugging these into the formula gives us 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. So, if 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. That makes sense because 100% - 16% = 84%. Now, using the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the sum of all genotypes should equal 1. So, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. Plugging in p=0.6 and q=0.4:\n\np\u00b2 = 0.36\nq\u00b2 = 0.16\nSo, 0.36 + 0.16 = 0.52. Then, 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48. Adding all together: 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1.00, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt) is 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Wait, no\u2014the question isn't about a cross between parents; it's about the entire student population. So, in the population, 16% don't show the trait, meaning they are tt.\n\nNow, the question asks what percentage of students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant allele (T) and one recessive allele (t). In a monohybrid cross, the frequency of heterozygotes is calculated using the formula 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive. But wait, let me think again.\n\nIn the case of a simple dominant-recessive relationship, each person has two alleles. For a particular trait, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the trait. Here, the trait is not expressed unless you have at least one T. So, the non-phenotypic carriers (homozygous recessives) make up 16% of the population. \n\nTo find out how many people are heterozygous, we need to use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that in a large, randomly mating population, the frequencies of genotypes remain constant from generation to generation. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the recessive, and pq is the heterozygote.\n\nSince 16% are tt (q\u00b2), we can find q first. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us 0.4, so q = 0.4. Then, p would be 1 - q, which is 0.6. Now, the frequency of heterozygotes (2pq) is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let me calculate that: 2 * 0.6 is 1.2, multiplied by 0.4 gives 0.48 or 48%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% (since 100 - 16 = 84) are either TT or Tt. In a population where the trait is expressed, the proportion of TT would be p\u00b2 = 0.6\u00b2 = 0.36, which is 36% of the population.

Wait, no\u2014if 16% cannot roll their tongue, then 84% do roll their tongue. In the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the proportion of carriers (heterozygotes) is 2pq, which in this case is 2*(0.6)*(0.4)=0.48 or 48%. So why is there an option E with 20%? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of those who can roll their tongue, which would be 84%, but that's not what the question asks. It specifically asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, which according to my calculation is 48%.

The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one.\n\nSince 84% roll the tongue (which is q\u00b2), let's solve for q first. Taking the square root of 0.84 gives approximately 0.9165 or 91.65%, which would mean p is 1 - q, so around 8.35%. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that. Actually, since q\u00b2 = 0.84, taking the square root gives q \u2248 0.9165. Then p = 1 - q \u2248 0.0835, or 8.35%.\n\nBut wait, that seems low. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that q\u00b2 = 0.16 (since 16% can't roll). Oh, right! Because 16% can't roll, that's q\u00b2. So q\u00b2 = 0.16, meaning q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. So q is 40%. Therefore, p is 1 - q = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNow, to find the heterozygous frequency, which is 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%. Hmm, but wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait no, because q is the recessive allele, which is 0.4 (40%), and p is 0.6 (60%). So heterozygotes are 2*p*q = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But looking at the options, F is 48%, which matches. However, another approach might consider that some textbooks use different formulas. Alternatively, sometimes people confuse the probabilities when calculating expected genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total percentage is 100%, the sum of p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 should equal 100%. We know q\u00b2 = 84%, so p\u00b2 + 2pq = 16%. From q = 0.4, p = 0.6. So p\u00b2 = 0.36, 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4)=0.48, which adds up to 0.84 + 0.48 = 1.32? Wait, that can't be right because 0.36 + 0.48 = 0.84, plus 0.84 makes 1.68, which exceeds 100%. So there's a miscalculation here.\n\nAh, no, actually, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. Here, p\u00b2 = 0.36, q\u00b2=0.84, so adding them gives 0.36 + 0.84 = 1.2, which already exceeds 1. That suggests an error in calculation. Wait, no, because p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, then p + q = 1, which is correct. So p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 should be (p+q)^2 = 1^2 =1. But according to our numbers, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 0.36 + 0.84 = 1.2, which is more than 1. So something is wrong here.\n\nThis indicates that my initial assumption was incorrect. Let me re-examine. If 16% can't roll, that's q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, p\u00b2 = 0.36, q\u00b2 = 0.16, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 0.52. Then 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48. Adding all together, 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1.0. Perfect. So the total is correctly accounted for. Therefore, the heterozygous proportion is 2pq = 0.48, which is 48% of the students. So the answer should be F, 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key point is that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the dominant allele allows them to roll, those who can't must be homozygous for the recessive allele. That means both copies of their gene are the recessive one. In terms of percentages, 16% can't roll, so 84% do roll because 100% minus 16% equals 84%. \n\nNow, we're supposed to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele. In a population, the Hardy-Weinberg principle tells us how often each genotype appears based on allele frequencies. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one.\n\nSince 84% roll the tongue (which is q\u00b2), let's solve for q first. Taking the square root of 0.84 gives approximately 0.9165 or 91.65%, which would mean p is 1 - q, so around 8.35%. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that.

Let me check again.\n\nWait no, because q is the recessive allele, which is 0.4 (40%), and p is 0.6 (60%). So heterozygotes are 2*p*q = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But looking at the options, F is 48%, which matches. However, another approach might consider that some textbooks use different formulas. Alternatively, sometimes people confuse the probabilities when calculating expected genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total percentage is 100%, the sum of p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 should equal 100%. We know q\u00b2 = 84%, so p\u00b2 + 2pq = 16%. From q = 0.4, p = 0.6. So p\u00b2 = 0.36, 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4)=0.48, which adds up to 0.84 + 0.48 = 1.32?

The equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1 represents the frequencies of the three possible genotypes in a population. Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the frequency of the recessive allele, and p\u00b2, 2pq, and q\u00b2 represent the proportions of homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive individuals, respectively.\n\nGiven that 16% cannot roll their tongue, that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.4, meaning p (the dominant allele's frequency) is 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNext, I want to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values I found: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but let me think again\u2014does that make sense? Because 16% is homozygous recessive, then the remaining 84% (since 100% - 16% = 84%) are either heterozygous or homozygous dominant. However, since heterozygotes also contribute to expressing the dominant trait, but in this case, they don't because the recessive allele is not expressed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks specifically about heterozygotes who do not express the trait due to the recessive allele. So, regardless of whether they're heterozygous or homozygous dominant, they still don't show the trait. But the question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, irrespective of whether they actually express the trait. Or does it mean that among those who cannot roll their tongue (homozygous recessive), how many are heterozygotes? No, that wouldn't make sense because all heterozygotes cannot roll their tongue. Wait, no\u2014the question specifies that the ability to roll the tongue is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. So, anyone without the dominant allele cannot roll their tongue, whether they're homozygous or heterozygous. Therefore, the total number of students who cannot roll their tongue is equal to the sum of homozygous recessive (q\u00b2) and heterozygous (2pq). But since the recessive phenotype isn't expressed, both groups (homozygous and heterozygous) cannot roll their tongue. Wait, but the question specifically refers to the inability to roll their tongue, which includes both homozygous recessive (q\u00b2) and heterozygous (2pq). Therefore, the 16% cannot roll their tongue include both these groups. But the question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not including those who cannot roll their tongue. Hmm, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the question is: \"What percentage of students are heterozygous?\" Given that 16% cannot roll their tongue, and knowing that the recessive allele doesn't confer the trait, but the presence of the dominant allele allows expression. So, any student who has at least one dominant allele (either homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive) will have the trait. Wait no\u2014that's incorrect because the recessive allele doesn't express. So, only those who have at least one dominant allele (i.e., heterozygous and dominant dominant) will express the trait. Wait, no\u2014the dominant allele allows expression, so only homozygous dominant individuals (p\u00b2) and heterozygous (2pq) will show the trait, while homozygous recessive (q\u00b2) will not. But the question is about the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Regardless of whether they can roll their tongue or not, the heterozygotes themselves are just another genotype. So, in this case, the percentage of heterozygotes is simply 2pq, which we calculated as 48%.\n\nBut let me cross-check using another approach. Since q\u00b2 = 0.16, q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6. The number of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48 or 48%. So, the answer should be F. 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key piece of information given is that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when an individual has two recessive alleles, these students must be homozygous for the recessive gene. That means each of them has two copies of the non-relevant allele.\n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygotes would carry both alleles\u2014one dominant and one recessive. In such cases, they should express the dominant trait, which is rolling their tongue.

To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4.

Wait, no\u2014since the recessive allele doesn't give the trait, those who can't roll must have two recessive alleles. But wait, let's think again. Actually, since the trait is dominant, having at least one dominant allele would mean someone can roll their tongue. So, if someone can't, they must have two recessive alleles.\n\nSo, the students who can't roll their tongue make up 16%. Since these are homozygous recessives (aa), we're looking at the frequency of the aa genotype. Now, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Aa). Heterozygotes are carriers but don't show the trait.\n\nIn a diploid organism like humans, the frequencies of genotypes under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can be calculated using p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (A) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (a).\n\nGiven that 16% cannot roll their tongue, which is q\u00b2. So, q\u00b2 = 16%, which means q = sqrt(16%) = 0.4. Therefore, q is 40%.\n\nSince p + q = 1 (because all alleles sum to 100%), p = 1 - q = 0.6. So, p is 60%, meaning A is present in 60% of the population.\n\nNow, the heterozygote frequency is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014the question is asking for heterozygotes among those who can roll their tongue. Because not everyone with the dominant allele can roll their tongue; some might still be carriers (heterozygous). However, the 16% who can't are homozygous recessives, so the remaining 84% (100% - 16%) can either be carriers or have the dominant allele. But in this case, since the question specifically asks for heterozygotes, regardless of whether they can roll their tongue, it should include those who are carriers even though they can't roll their tongue. Wait, no\u2014if they can't roll their tongue, they're either aa (so they can't) or AA (they can, just maybe more strongly). But wait, the question states that 16% cannot roll their tongue, implying they have aa. So, the remaining 84% can either have AA or Aa. But according to the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the proportion of carriers (Aa) is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. However, wait\u2014the question says \"the ability to roll the tongue\" is determined by the dominant allele, so if someone has at least one A allele, they can roll their tongue. So, the 16% who can't are aa, and the rest (84%) can roll their tongue, which includes AA and Aa. But the question is asking specifically for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, i.e., Aa. So, 48% of the entire student population are heterozygotes. But wait, the options include 48% as option F. Hmm, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only those who can roll their tongue, so the total possible is 84% (AA + Aa = 64% + 20% = 84%). Out of these, how many are heterozygotes? In the AA group, there are none, because AA individuals can definitely roll their tongue. So, all heterozygotes (Aa) are part of the 84% who can roll their tongue. Therefore, the number of heterozygotes is 2pq = 48%, out of the 84% who can roll their tongue. So, the percentage of the entire student body that are heterozygotes is 48% / 84% \u2248 57.14%. But that's not an option provided. Wait, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the initial approach.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is only referring to those who can roll their tongue, which includes both AA and Aa. So, the total percentage of students who can roll their tongue is 100% - 16% = 84%. Among these, the percentage who are heterozygous (Aa) is equal to 2pq, which is 48% as per earlier. So, the percentage of the entire student body that are heterozygotes is (48% / 84%) \u2248 57.14%, but that's not one of the options. However, none of the options match 57.14%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 48% of the entire student body, assuming that the question considers only the proportion within the AA and Aa groups. But that seems unlikely because the question specifies \"students,\" which implies the entire population. So, maybe I need to consider the overall percentages differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me start over:\n\nTotal students: 100%\n\nCan roll tongue: 84% (AA + Aa)\n\nCannot roll tongue: 16% (aa)\n\nIn the aa group, q\u00b2 = 16%, so q = 0.4, so p = 0.6.\n\nHeterozygotes (Aa): 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, so 48% of the entire population.\n\nBut the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. \n\nThe key point given is that 16% of the students can't roll their tongue. That means they don't have the dominant allele or both alleles are recessive. Wait, no\u2014since the recessive allele doesn't give the trait, those who can't roll must have two recessive alleles. But wait, let's think again. Actually, since the trait is dominant, having at least one dominant allele would mean someone can roll their tongue. So, if someone can't, they must have two recessive alleles.\n\nSo, the students who can't roll their tongue make up 16%. Since these are homozygous recessives (aa), we're looking at the frequency of the aa genotype. Now, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Aa). Heterozygotes are carriers but don't show the trait.\n\nIn a diploid organism like humans, the frequencies of genotypes under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can be calculated using p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (A) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (a).\n\nGiven that 16% cannot roll their tongue, which is q\u00b2. So, q\u00b2 = 16%, which means q = sqrt(16%) = 0.4. Therefore, q is 40%.\n\nSince p + q = 1 (because all alleles sum to 100%), p = 1 - q = 0.6. So, p is 60%, meaning A is present in 60% of the population.\n\nNow, the heterozygote frequency is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014the question is asking for heterozygotes among those who can roll their tongue. Because not everyone with the dominant allele can roll their tongue; some might still be carriers (heterozygous). However, the 16% who can't are homozygous recessives, so the remaining 84% (100% - 16%) can either be carriers or have the dominant allele. But in this case, since the question specifically asks for heterozygotes, regardless of whether they can roll their tongue, it should include those who are carriers even though they can't roll their tongue. Wait, no\u2014if they can't roll their tongue, they're either aa (so they can't) or AA (they can, just maybe more strongly). But wait, the question states that 16% cannot roll their tongue, implying they have aa. So, the remaining 84% can either have AA or Aa. But according to the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the proportion of carriers (Aa) is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. However, wait\u2014the question says \"the ability to roll the tongue\" is determined by the dominant allele, so if someone has at least one A allele, they can roll their tongue. So, the 16% who can't are aa, and the rest (84%) can roll their tongue, which includes AA and Aa. But the question is asking specifically for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, i.e., Aa. So, 48% of the entire student population are heterozygotes. But wait, the options include 48% as option F. Hmm, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only those who can roll their tongue, so the total possible is 84% (AA + Aa = 64% + 20% = 84%). Out of these, how many are heterozygotes? In the AA group, there are none, because AA individuals can definitely roll their tongue. So, all heterozygotes (Aa) are part of the 84% who can roll their tongue. Therefore, the number of heterozygotes is 2pq = 48%, out of the 84% who can roll their tongue. So, the percentage of the entire student body that are heterozygotes is 48% / 84% \u2248 57.14%. But that's not an option provided. Wait, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the initial approach.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is only referring to those who can roll their tongue, which includes both AA and Aa. So, the total percentage of students who can roll their tongue is 100% - 16% = 84%. Among these, the percentage who are heterozygous (Aa) is equal to 2pq, which is 48% as per earlier. So, the percentage of the entire student body that are heterozygotes is (48% / 84%) \u2248 57.14%, but that's not one of the options. However, none of the options match 57.14%. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 48% of the entire student body, assuming that the question considers only the proportion within the AA and Aa groups. But that seems unlikely because the question specifies \"students,\" which implies the entire population. So, maybe I need to consider the overall percentages differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me start over:\n\nTotal students: 100%\n\nCan roll tongue: 84% (AA + Aa)\n\nCannot roll tongue: 16% (aa)\n\nIn the aa group, q\u00b2 = 16%, so q = 0.4, so p = 0.6.\n\nHeterozygotes (Aa): 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, so 48% of the entire population.\n\nBut the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. So, it's 48% of the entire student body. Looking back at the options, option F is 48 percent. So, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (A), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (a).\n\nSince we know that the recessive phenotype (aa) makes up 16% of the population, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4.\n\nNow, since p + q = 1 (because these are the only two alleles), p must be 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6.\n\nNext, we want to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let me calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.6 and 0.4: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.\n\nThen, multiply by 2: 2 * 0.24 = 0.48.\n\nSo, 0.48 corresponds to 48% of the students being heterozygous. Therefore, the answer should be F. 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

That makes sense because if both alleles were recessive, they'd be unable to roll their tongue. So, for someone not to be able to roll their tongue, they must have two copies of the recessive allele.\n\nNext, the question asks how many students are heterozygous, meaning they have one dominant allele and one recessive allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, right? So, they should be able to roll their tongue, which means they shouldn't be part of the 16% who can't.\n\nLet me think about the Punnett square scenario. Suppose we consider the gene locus involved as the tongue-rolling trait. Let's say the dominant allele is represented by 'T' and the recessive by 't'. The genotype for someone who can't roll their tongue would be tt, since they can't show the dominant trait. For someone who can roll their tongue, they could be either TT or Tt.\n\nGiven that 16% of the students are tt (homozygous recessive), that corresponds to the frequency of the recessive phenotype. In a monohybrid cross, the frequency of the recessive homozygote is q\u00b2. So, if q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is p = 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNow, the question wants the percentage of heterozygotes (Tt). The frequency of heterozygotes in a population is 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes problems might involve other factors like incomplete dominance or variable expression, but the question seems straightforward.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a typical Mendelian analysis without considering any complications, the calculation holds.
