That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. So after phagocytosis, the phagosome would fuse with lysosomes to digest the engulfed material. That makes sense. Then option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to F, but maybe more specific. Wait, if the vesicle fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But the options are about the fate of the vesicle. So F and G both mention fusing with a lysosome or releasing into the cytoplasm. However, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. If the vesicle is a phagosome, then after fusion with lysosomes, the contents are digested. But the answer choices might have different specifics. Let me check again. The options: F is merging with a lysosome (which is a common process), while G is releasing contents to the cytoplasm. But phagocytosis leads to the phagosome fusing with lysosomes, which then release digestive enzymes. So the vesicle's contents are digested within the cell. Therefore, the correct answer would be either F or G. But wait, the options are separate. Let me think again. The question asks which would most likely describe the fate. If the vesicle is formed via phagocytosis, then it's enclosed in a phagosome. The next step is that the phagosome fuses with lysosomes. So the answer is F. Because lysosomes are involved in degradation. Alternatively, if the vesicle was released from the cell, that's exocytosis, but that's not the case here. So the correct answer should be F. But let me check the options again. Option F is \"The vesicle merges with a lysosome.\" Yes, that's correct. So the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. So phagocytosed material would fuse with lysosomes to digest them. That makes sense. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to F, but maybe more specific. However, if the vesicle merges with the lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, maybe it's exocytosis. Wait, but phagocytosis leads to phagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes. So F and G could both be possible. But the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. When a vesicle (phagosome) is formed, it's meant to be internalized and then degraded. So it would fuse with lysosomes, which are the organelles responsible for digestion. Therefore, F is correct. But wait, option G says the contents are released to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released unless it's exocytosing. However, the main function of phagocytosis is to bring in the material for digestion, which occurs via lysosomal fusion. So the answer should be F. Let me check the options again. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Yes, that's standard. So the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which then needs to be degraded by lysosomes, this makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to what happens with lysosomes. If the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. So G might also be possible. But wait, the question is about the fate of the vesicle formed by phagocytosis. Let me think again. When a cell engulfs a particle via phagocytosis, the phagosome is then fused with lysosomes, leading to digestion. So the vesicle (phagosome) would fuse with a lysosome (option F) or maybe the cell membrane (option D). However, option D says the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and expels contents. But if the phagosome is already inside the cell, fusing with the membrane would mean releasing the contents outside, which is exocytosis. But phagocytosis is about taking in, then processing. So if the phagosome fuses with the cell membrane, that would be exocytosis. But the question is about the fate of the vesicle formed by phagocytosis. So the main processing would involve fusion with lysosomes. Therefore, option F: merges with a lysosome. Alternatively, option G says release to the cytoplasm for digestion. But if the lysosome is present, then the phagosome would fuse with the lysosome, and the contents would be digested. So the correct answer is F. Let me check the options again. Option F is \"The vesicle merges with a lysosome.\" Yes, that's standard. So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. Since phagocytosis leads to the formation of phagosomes, which are then fused with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. So F seems possible. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to what happens in lysosomes. But if the vesicle is a phagosome, then after fusion with lysosomes, the contents are digested. So maybe G is also a possibility. Option H: absorbed by ER. No, ER is involved in protein synthesis and modification, not directly in phagocytosis. Option I: merged with nucleus. Unlikely, since the nucleus handles genetic material, not digestion. Option J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are involved in oxidation reactions, but again, phagosomes are more likely to fuse with lysosomes. So between F and G. Let me think again. When a vesicle (phagosome) is formed, it's meant to be degraded. So the correct answer should be that it fuses with a lysosome. Therefore, F. However, sometimes people confuse phagocytosis with exocytosis. But the question specifically asks about the fate of the vesicle formed by phagocytosis. So the vesicle is enclosed, then needs to be broken down. So yes, F. Alternatively, if the vesicle is released into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis, but that's not phagocytosis. So the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that digest cellular waste. So phagocytosed materials are enclosed in the phagosome, which then merges with lysosomes to break them down. That makes sense. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F, but phagocytosis leads to the formation of phagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes. So if they release into the cytoplasm, that's more like exocytosis. But the question is about the fate of the vesicle formed via phagocytosis. So the main thing is that the phagosome is processed by lysosomes. Therefore, the answer should be F. Let me check again. The key here is that after phagocytosis, the vesicle (phagosome) merges with lysosomes to digest the material. So the correct answer is F. Let me make sure none of the other options fit better. Option D says it fuses with the cell membrane and expels contents. But phagocytosis is about taking in, not expelling. Unless the phagosome is being released, but that's not standard. So F is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. Since phagocytosis leads to phagosome formation, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. So F looks possible. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to what happens in lysosomes, but the phagosome itself would fuse with lysosomes. So G might be a distractor. Option H: absorbed by ER. ER is involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism, not directly related to phagocytosis. So H is less likely. Option I: merged with nucleus. Nucleus is for DNA and RNA, not involved in digesting materials. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle detoxification, but again, phagosomes are digested by lysosomes. So between F and G. Let me think again. When a phagosome fuses with lysosomes, the contents get digested. So the answer should be F. Because the vesicle (phagosome) is fused with lysosomes, which contain digestive enzymes. So the correct choice is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. So after phagocytosis, the phagosome would fuse with lysosomes to digest the engulfed material. That makes sense. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to F, but if the vesicle merges with the lysosome, then the contents are digested. But option G says release to the cytoplasm, which could be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's content is first digested in the lysosome. So maybe F is better. Option H: absorbed by ER. No, ER is involved in protein synthesis and modification, not absorption. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle oxidation reactions, but again, phagosomes are more likely to merge with lysosomes. So between F and G. Wait, the question is about the fate of the vesicle formed by phagocytosis. The key here is that phagocytosis leads to the formation of a phagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes to digest the material. So the answer should be F. Let me check again. The options: F is the vesicle merges with a lysosome, which is correct. So the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own.

Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down the ingested materials. So yes, phagocytosed material is enclosed in a phagosome, which then merges with lysosomes to digest. So F could be correct. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to what F says, but G is more general. However, if the vesicle merges with the lysosome, then the contents are digested. So maybe G is also possible. But wait, the question says \"most likely\" describe the fate. Let me think again. Phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes (lysosomal fusion) to digest the material. So the answer would be F. But option G says \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" Wait, does that mean the vesicle is expelled? No, because the lysosome is within the cell. So if the vesicle merges with the lysosome, the contents are digested. So G might be a bit misleading because it says \"released to the cytoplasm,\" but actually, the lysosome is inside the cell. So maybe G is incorrect. Alternatively, if the vesicle fuses with the lysosome, then the contents are digested, which would be part of the process. So the answer is F.

First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. So after phagocytosis, the phagosome (vesicle) would fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F. But phagosomes are meant to be internalized and then degraded. So if they fuse with lysosomes, their contents get digested. But wait, sometimes phagosomes can also release content via exocytosis, but that's less common. Option H: absorbed by ER. No, ER is for protein synthesis and transport, not absorption. Option I: merged with nucleus. Nucleus is for DNA and ribosomes, not really involved in phagocytosis. Option J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle detoxification, but again, phagosomes are more likely to fuse with lysosomes. So between F and G. Wait, the question says \"the vesicle formed as a result of phagocytosis.\" So the phagosome would fuse with lysosomes. Therefore, the answer should be F. Let me check again. Phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes to digest the material. So yes, F. But wait, some sources say that phagosomes can sometimes merge with the cell membrane, but that's not the case here. The key is that the vesicle is processed within the cell, so the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. So phagocytosed particles would fuse with lysosomes to digest them. That makes sense. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to F, but maybe more specific. However, the question is about the fate of the vesicle. If it's a phagosome, after fusion with lysosomes, the contents are digested. So F and G both seem possible. But wait, the answer choices have F and G. Let me check again. The options are F and G. But the question is which is \"most likely.\" So if the vesicle is formed via phagocytosis, it's enclosed in a phagosome. Then, the phagosome would fuse with lysosomes (lysosomal enzymes) to break down the ingested material. Therefore, option F: merges with a lysosome. Alternatively, G says release contents to the cytoplasm to be digested. But if it's fused with lysosomes, the contents are digested within the lysosome, not released into the cytoplasm. So G might be incorrect. Therefore, F is the correct answer. Let me check the other options again. Option H talks about the ER, which isn't involved in phagocytosis.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. So phagocytosed material would fuse with lysosomes to digest the particle. That makes sense.

First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down the ingested material. Yes, that makes sense. Phagocytosis leads to the formation of phagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes to digest the material. So F could be correct. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F, but the term here is \"released to the cytoplasm.\" However, if the vesicle fuses with a lysosome, the contents are digested within the lysosome, not directly released into the cytoplasm. So maybe G is incorrect. Option H: absorbed by the ER. No, ER is involved in protein synthesis and transport, not phagocytosis. J: merges with a peroxisome. Peroxisomes handle oxidative metabolism, but they're less commonly involved in phagocytic processes. So the main thing here is that phagocytosis leads to the phagosome fusing with lysosomes. Therefore, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down materials. So phagocytosed material is usually transported into the lysosome via fusion. So F seems possible. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That sounds similar to what happens in lysosomes. If the vesicle fuses with a lysosome, then the contents would be digested. But wait, the question is about the fate of the vesicle formed by phagocytosis. So if the vesicle is phagocytized, it becomes a phagosome. Then, depending on the cell type, it may fuse with lysosomes (option F) or perhaps be used for other purposes. But option D says it fuses with the cell membrane and expels contents. Wait, but phagocytosis is about engulfing, then the vesicle is internalized. If it fuses with the cell membrane, that would mean releasing the contents back out, which is more like exocytosis. However, phagocytosis's purpose is to bring in materials for digestion, so the vesicle would likely be broken down by lysosomes. So option F makes sense here. Let me check again. The key points: phagocytosis \u2192 phagosome \u2192 lysosome fusion for digestion. So the answer should be F. But wait, some sources say that after phagocytosis, the phagosome can fuse with lysosomes. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
