    "rollout": " However, if the vesicle is a phagosome, it's supposed to fuse with lysosomes. So maybe G is also possible. Wait, but the question asks for the most likely description. Let me think again. When a vesicle from phagocytosis (phagosome) fuses with lysosomes, the contents get digested. So that's a common pathway. But some sources say that after phagocytosis, the phagosome may fuse with lysosomes, leading to digestion. Alternatively, sometimes phagosomes can fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum, but that's less common. Also, the options include F and G. Which is more accurate? The question is about the fate of the vesicle. The phagosome is then enclosed within the lysosome, so the answer would be F. But wait, option G says the contents are released to the cytoplasm to be digested. That's the same as the phagosome fusing with lysosomes, releasing the contents into the cytoplasm. So both F and G seem related. But the question is which is more correct. Let me check standard biology facts. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes. The lysosomal enzymes break down the engulfed material. Therefore, the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with lysosomes. So the correct answer would be F. But wait, the options have F as \"merges with a lysosome\" and G as \"releases contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" Are these two different? Because if the vesicle fuses with lysosomes, then the contents are released into the cytoplasm. So both F and G could be considered correct. But the question is about the most likely. In the options, perhaps F is more direct. However, some textbooks might consider G as correct. Wait, but the answer choices might have only one correct. Let me check the options again. The options are A to J. Let me go back. The key here is that phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which then undergoes fusion with lysosomes. So the correct answer is F. But another thought: if the vesicle is a phagosome, then once fused with lysosomes, the contents are digested. So the answer would be either F or G. However, the options might have only one correct. Looking at the options, F is \"merges with a lysosome,\" while G is \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" Both are true, but which is the best fit. The question is which would most likely describe the fate. Since the phagosome is meant to be digested by lysosomes, the correct answer is F. But wait, in some cases, the phagosome might release the contents directly into the cytoplasm, but that's not the case. It's more likely that the phagosome fuses with lysosomes. Therefore, the answer should be F. However, I need to make sure. Another angle: the options mention \"fuses with the cell membrane and its contents are expelled out of the cell\" (option D). But phagocytosis is about engulfing, so the vesicle is inside the cell. Unless it's exocytosis, but that's when the cell releases content. So D is about expelling, which is not the case here. So D is incorrect. So between F and G. If the vesicle fuses with lysosomes, then the contents are digested. So the answer is F. But if the question is about the process, then the answer is F.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle is a phagosome, it's supposed to fuse with lysosomes. So maybe G is also possible. Wait, but the question asks for the most likely description. Let me think again. When a vesicle from phagocytosis (phagosome) fuses with lysosomes, the contents get digested. So that's a common pathway. But some sources say that after phagocytosis, the phagosome may fuse with lysosomes, leading to digestion. Alternatively, sometimes phagosomes can fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum, but that's less common. Also, the options include F and G. Which is more accurate? The question is about the fate of the vesicle. The phagosome is then enclosed within the lysosome, so the answer would be F. But wait, option G says the contents are released to the cytoplasm to be digested. That's the same as the phagosome fusing with lysosomes, releasing the contents into the cytoplasm. So both F and G seem related. But the question is which is more correct. Let me check standard biology facts. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes. The lysosomal enzymes break down the engulfed material. Therefore, the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with lysosomes. So the correct answer would be F. But wait, the options have F as \"merges with a lysosome\" and G as \"releases contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" Are these two different? Because if the vesicle fuses with lysosomes, then the contents are released into the cytoplasm. So both F and G could be considered correct. But the question is about the most likely. In the options, perhaps F is more direct. However, some textbooks might consider G as correct. Wait, but the answer choices might have only one correct. Let me check the options again. The options are A to J. Let me go back. The key here is that phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which then undergoes fusion with lysosomes. So the correct answer is F. But another thought: if the vesicle is a phagosome, then once fused with lysosomes, the contents are digested. So the answer would be either F or G. However, the options might have only one correct. Looking at the options, F is \"merges with a lysosome,\" while G is \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" Both are true, but which is the best fit. The question is which would most likely describe the fate. Since the phagosome is meant to be digested by lysosomes, the correct answer is F. But wait, in some cases, the phagosome might release the contents directly into the cytoplasm, but that's not the case. It's more likely that the phagosome fuses with lysosomes.

But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, the phagosome would first fuse with lysosomes, not directly release into the cytoplasm. Unless the lysosomes release their contents into the cytoplasm, but that's not exactly the same. Option H: absorbed by ER. ER is involved in protein synthesis and modification, not directly related to phagocytosis. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle oxidative metabolism, but again, phagosomes are usually processed by lysosomes. So between F and G. Wait, the question says \"the vesicle formed as a result of phagocytosis.\" So phagocytosis creates a phagosome. The next step is that the phagosome fuses with lysosomes (lysosomal fusion) to digest the content. Therefore, the correct answer would be F. But wait, some sources say that after phagocytosis, the phagosome can either be degraded by lysosomes or transported to other organelles. However, the main fate is lysosomal fusion. So F is correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle merges with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But does the phagosome merge with the lysosome directly? Yes, that's part of the process. So both F and G might be possible. But wait, the question asks for the most likely description. Let me check the options again. Option F says \"merges with a lysosome,\" while G says \"releases contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" The key here is that after phagocytosis, the phagosome (vesicle) would typically fuse with lysosomes to digest the material. So the contents are digested within the lysosome, not released out of the cell. Therefore, G might be incorrect because releasing to the cytoplasm would mean exocytosis, which isn't the case here. So F is more accurate. Then the answer should be F. Let me check the options again. Option J: merges with a peroxisome. Peroxisomes are involved in oxidation reactions, but they're not the main site for phagocytic digestion. So J is less likely. So the best choice is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter.

That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle is a phagosome, it's already containing the particle. If it fuses with a lysosome, the contents get digested. But G says release to the cytoplasm, which might be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed via lysosomes. So maybe F is better. Option H: absorbed by ER. ER is involved in protein synthesis and modification, not directly related to phagocytosis. So H is probably wrong. Option I: merged with nucleus. Nucleus is for DNA and RNA, not involved in digestion. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle oxidation reactions, but again, phagocytic vesicles are usually lysosomes. So between F and G. Let me think again. When a vesicle from phagocytosis (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, the contents are digested. That's a standard process. So F would be correct. But wait, option G says releasing contents to the cytoplasm. If the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, then the contents would exit the cell. But phagocytosis's vesicle is not going out; it's being broken down. So F is more accurate. Therefore, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle merges with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed. So maybe F is better. Option H: absorbed by ER. ER is involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism, but phagocytosis's vesicle isn't absorbed by ER. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle oxidation reactions, but again, phagosomes would go to lysosomes. So between F and G. Wait, the question says \"the vesicle... is expelled out of the cell\" (option D). But phagocytosis's vesicle is typically stored in the phagosome until it's processed. If it's merged with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. So D is about expelling, but if the vesicle is fused with lysosome, then the contents are digested. So perhaps D is incorrect because the vesicle isn't expelled but digested. Therefore, the correct answer is F: merges with lysosome. Let me check again. Yes, after phagocytosis, the phagosome fuses with lysosomes to digest the material. So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Also, lysosomes are involved in digestion. So the answer is F. Alternatively, if the vesicle is merged with the cell membrane, then the contents are expelled. But in phagocytosis, the vesicle is not expelled unless it's being secreted. But the question is about the fate of the vesicle itself. The usual process is that the phagosome fuses with lysosomes to digest the material. Therefore, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, the phagosome fuses with the lysosome, which contains digestive enzymes. So if the vesicle (phagosome) merges with the lysosome, the contents are digested. So maybe G is also possible. But wait, the options are separate. Let me check again. The question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. So if the phagosome merges with the lysosome, then the contents are digested. So F and G both seem possible. But the options are separate. Let me think again. The key here is that phagocytosis creates a phagosome, which then merges with lysosomes. So the correct answer would be F. Because lysosomes are the organelles that digest the ingested material. Option G says the contents are released to the cytoplasm to be digested. Wait, but the lysosome is inside the cell, so releasing to the cytoplasm would mean the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and releases contents into the cytosol. But that's exocytosis. But in phagocytosis, the phagosome is fused with the lysosome, not the cell membrane. So the correct answer is F. Therefore, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter.

Peroxisomes are involved in oxidation reactions, but they're not the main target for phagocytosed materials. So J is less likely. So between F and G. But if the vesicle is fused with a lysosome, then the contents are digested (option F), whereas option G says the contents are released to the cytoplasm. Wait, but if the lysosome fuses with the vesicle, the contents would be digested inside the lysosome, not released into the cytoplasm. So G might not be correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with the lysosome, then the contents are digested. So G might be a possible answer too. But wait, the question is about the fate of the vesicle formed by phagocytosis. So the phagosome would merge with lysosomes, leading to digestion. Therefore, F and G both seem related. But the options are separate. Let me check the options again. Option F is \"merges with a lysosome,\" and G is \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" Which is more accurate? Well, when the phagosome fuses with a lysosome, the contents are digested by lysosomal enzymes. So the release to the cytoplasm would be part of that process. But the question is about the fate of the vesicle itself. So if the vesicle merges with the lysosome, that's the immediate step. But does the content get released into the cytoplasm? Or does it stay within the lysosome? Hmm. In phagocytosis, the phagosome is transported to the lysosome, where the enzymes break down the material. So the vesicle (phagosome) would fuse with the lysosome, and the contents are digested. So the answer would be F, since it's about merging with a lysosome. Alternatively, G is about releasing contents to the cytoplasm. But if the lysosome is already in the cell, the contents wouldn't go to the cytoplasm unless they're released via exocytosis. But in this case, the phagosome is being digested by the lysosome, so the contents are broken down inside the cell. Therefore, the correct answer is F. Let me check the options again. The options are: F. merges with a lysosome. Yes, that's the standard process. So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with lysosomes, then the contents are digested. But does the vesicle release directly into the cytoplasm? No, it's digested within the lysosome. So G might be incorrect. Option H: absorbed by ER. The ER is involved in protein synthesis and modification, but phagosomes aren't absorbed by the ER. Option I: merged with nucleus. That's not relevant here. Option J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle oxidation reactions, but again, phagosomes would go to lysosomes. So between F and G. Let me think again. The key point is that phagocytosis forms a phagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes to digest the material. Therefore, the correct answer should be F. But wait, some sources say that after phagocytosis, the phagosome can either be degraded by lysosomes or used for antigen presentation.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell.
