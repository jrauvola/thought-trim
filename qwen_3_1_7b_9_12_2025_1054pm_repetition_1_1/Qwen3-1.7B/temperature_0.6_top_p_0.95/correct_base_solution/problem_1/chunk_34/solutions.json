The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense.

That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed. So maybe F is better. Option H: absorbed by ER. ER is for protein synthesis and modification, not really involved in phagocytosis. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle oxidation reactions, but again, they're not the main target for phagocytic materials. So between F and G. Let me think again. The key here is that phagocytosis creates a phagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes. Lysosomes have hydrolytic enzymes that break down the ingested material. Therefore, the correct answer should be F. But wait, option G says \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" That's actually exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is being digested via lysosomal fusion.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed. So maybe F is better. Option H: absorbed by ER. ER is involved in protein synthesis and modification, not really related to phagocytosis. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle oxidation reactions, but again, phagocytic vesicles are more likely to go to lysosomes. So between F and G. Let me think again. When a cell engulfs a particle via phagocytosis, the phagosome is surrounded by a membrane. It then fuses with lysosomes, which have digestive enzymes. So the contents are broken down. Therefore, the correct answer should be F. But wait, option G says \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" If the vesicle fuses with the lysosome, then the contents are digested inside the lysosome, not released into the cytoplasm. So G is incorrect. Therefore, F is the right choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell.

So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually processed via lysosomes. So F and G both seem possible. Wait, but the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. When a phagosome fuses with a lysosome, the contents are digested. So that's a common pathway. Alternatively, if it's released to the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicles are typically internalized and then processed. So F is more accurate. Also, option D says it fuses with the cell membrane and expels contents. But that would be exocytosis, which is different from phagocytosis. Because phagocytosis is about taking in, not releasing. So D might not be correct. Option H talks about the ER, which is unrelated. J is peroxisomes, which are involved in detoxification, but phagosomes don't fuse with peroxisomes. So the best bet is F. But wait, another thought: sometimes after phagocytosis, the phagosome can merge with the lysosome, which is a key step in the immune response. So yes, F is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. Wait, but phagocytosis is about ingestion, so the vesicle would be internalized, then fused with lysosomes. So the correct answer would be F. Let me check the other options again.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is typically internalized and then processed. So maybe F is better. Option J: merges with a peroxisome. Peroxisomes are involved in oxidation reactions, but they're not typically involved in digesting phagocytic material. So J is less likely. Option H: absorbed by ER. ER is involved in protein synthesis and modification, but phagosomes aren't absorbed by ER. So H is wrong. Option I: merged with nucleus. That's not relevant here. So between F and G. Let me think again. When a vesicle from phagocytosis fuses with a lysosome, the contents are digested. So the answer would be F.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome.

That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet.

This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. Wait, phagocytosis is internal, so the vesicle is inside the cell. So if it's fused with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. Alternatively, if it's released out of the cell, that's exocytosis. But phagocytosis is about engulfing, not expelling. So perhaps the correct answer is F. Let me check the options again. Option F is \"The vesicle merges with a lysosome.\" Yes, lysosomes are the organelles that digest the phagocytized materials. Therefore, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed. So maybe F is better. Option J: merges with a peroxisome. Peroxisomes are involved in breaking down toxins and bilirubin. But they're less common in phagocytic vesicles compared to lysosomes. So J might not be correct. The key here is that after phagocytosis, the phagosome fuses with lysosomes to digest the material.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is meant to be internalized and then processed. So maybe F is better. Option H: absorbed by ER. ER is involved in protein synthesis and modification, not really related to phagocytosis. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are involved in breaking down toxins and fatty acids. But again, phagocytic vesicles are usually lysosomes. So between F and G. Let me think again. When a phagosome fuses with a lysosome, the contents are digested by lysosomal enzymes. If it's released to the cytoplasm, that's exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is supposed to be internalized and processed. Therefore, the correct answer should be F. So the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually processed via lysosomes. So maybe F is better. Option H: absorbed by ER. No, ER is for protein synthesis and modification, not for phagocytic vesicles. Option I: merged with nucleus. Unlikely, since the nucleus is involved in DNA and RNA, not digestion. Option J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle metabolism, but again, phagosomes are digested by lysosomes. So between F and G. Wait, the question is about the fate of the vesicle. If it's a phagosome, after being formed, it's supposed to fuse with lysosomes to digest the material. So the answer would be F. But wait, sometimes the phagosome may release contents to the cytoplasm, but that's exocytosis. However, phagocytosis is about internalizing, so the vesicle would be transported to lysosomes. Therefore, the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed. So maybe F is better. Option H: absorbed by ER. No, ER is for protein synthesis and modification, not for phagocytic vesicles. J: merges with peroxisomes. Peroxisomes handle oxidation reactions, but they're less common in phagocytic processes. So between F and G. Wait, the question says \"the vesicle... is fused with the cell membrane and its contents are expelled.\" If the vesicle is phagocytosed, then after being processed, the contents are digested.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome.

That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C.

So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is typically processed within the cell, so maybe G is also possible. Wait, but the question is about the fate of the vesicle formed by phagocytosis. The phagosome would fuse with lysosomes, leading to digestion. So F and G both mention fusing with a lysosome or releasing into the cytoplasm. But the key here is whether the vesicle is being expelled. If the vesicle is being fused with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. If it's released into the cytoplasm, then it's expelled. But phagocytosis's vesicle is internalized and then processed. So the usual process is fusion with lysosomes. Therefore, F would be the correct answer. Let me check the options again. Option F says \"merges with a lysosome,\" which is correct. Option G says \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" But that's more like exocytosis. However, the phagosome is not released; it's processed. So the correct answer should be F. Let me check if there's another possibility. For example, option J says merges with a peroxisome. Peroxisomes are involved in detoxification, but not primary digestion. So J is less likely. Option H is about ER, which isn't involved in phagocytosis. Option I is about the nucleus, which isn't relevant here. So yes, F is the best choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Option I mentions the nucleus, which isn't involved in phagocytic vesicle processing. Option J is peroxisomes, which handle some metabolic functions but aren't primary targets for phagocytosis. So between F and G. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. If the vesicle is formed via phagocytosis, it's a phagosome. The next step is that it fuses with a lysosome to digest the material. So the answer should be F. Because lysosomes are the organelles that break down the ingested material. Therefore, the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around.

But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense.
