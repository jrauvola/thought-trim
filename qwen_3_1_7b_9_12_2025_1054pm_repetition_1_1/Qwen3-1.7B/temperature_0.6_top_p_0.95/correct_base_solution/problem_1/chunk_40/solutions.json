    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again.

However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the vesicle (phagosome) merges with a lysosome. Alternatively, G says the contents are released to the cytoplasm. But that's not exactly accurate. Because the phagosome is enclosed within the cell, and the lysosome is another organelle. So the correct answer is F. Let me check the options again.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, merging with a lysosome. Alternatively, G says the contents are expelled out of the cell. But that would be if the vesicle was released from the cell, which isn't the case here. Because phagocytosis is internalizing, then the vesicle is processed inside the cell. So F is more accurate. Therefore, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense.

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since it merges with a lysosome. Alternatively, if the question is about the release of contents, then G.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. Therefore, the correct answer would be F: merges with a lysosome. Alternatively, G says it releases contents to the cytoplasm. But that's not accurate because the phagosome is inside the cell, and the lysosomes are also inside. Unless the vesicle is released via exocytosis, but that's not the case here. So F is more accurate. Let me check the options again. Option F is \"The vesicle merges with a lysosome.\" Yes, that's the standard process. So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own.

Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense.

Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense.

But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. Therefore, the correct answer would be F: merges with a lysosome. Alternatively, G says the contents are expelled. But expulsion would be exocytosis, which is different from phagocytosis.

This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer should be F, merging with a lysosome. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be if it's exocytosing, but phagocytosis's vesicle is usually not exocytosed unless it's a mistake. So F is more accurate. Also, the options mention the vesicle merging with the cell membrane, which would be exocytosis, but that's not the case here. Therefore, the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again.

Therefore, the correct answer would be F, since the vesicle (phagosome) merges with a lysosome. Alternatively, if the content is expelled, that's exocytosis, but that's not the case here.

But phagocytosis's vesicle is inside the cell, so releasing into the cytoplasm would require exocytosis, which is a different process. But phagocytosis's vesicle is not released; it's processed. So F is more accurate. Also, the lysosome is a organelle that contains digestive enzymes. So the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F or G. But wait, option G says \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" If the vesicle fuses with the lysosome, then the contents are digested within the lysosome, not released to the cytoplasm. So G would be incorrect. Therefore, F is correct. Option D says the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and expels contents. But phagocytosis's vesicle is meant to be internalized, not expelled. Unless it's a case where the vesicle is released, but that's not standard. So D is probably wrong. So between F and G. Wait, the options are F: merges with lysosome. G: releases contents to cytoplasm. Since the phagosome merges with lysosome, the contents are digested. So F is correct. Therefore, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the vesicle (phagosome) merges with a lysosome. Alternatively, option G says the contents are released to the cytoplasm. But that's not accurate unless the vesicle is exocytosing, which isn't the case here. Because phagocytosis is about taking in, not releasing. Therefore, the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own.

However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F or G. But wait, the options are separate. Let me check the options again. Option F is \"merges with a lysosome,\" and G is \"releases its contents to the cytoplasm to be digested.\" So if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested within the lysosome. But if it releases contents to the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis, which is a different process. However, phagocytosis's vesicle is usually not released out of the cell unless it's being excreted, but that's not typical. So the correct answer would be F. Alternatively, maybe G. But I think the standard process is that the phagosome fuses with lysosomes, so F. But let me check the options again. The options are all about the vesicle's fate. So the phagosome is enclosed in a membrane, and when it fuses with lysosomes, the content is digested. Therefore, the correct answer should be F. But wait, some sources say that after phagocytosis, the phagosome may merge with the ER or another structure, but no, the main processing is via lysosomes.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific.

That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome. Alternatively, G says the contents are expelled out of the cell. But that would be if the vesicle was secreted, not phagocytosed. So G is more about exocytosis. Therefore, the correct answer should be F. Let me check the options again. Option F is \"The vesicle merges with a lysosome.\" Yes, that's correct. So the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
