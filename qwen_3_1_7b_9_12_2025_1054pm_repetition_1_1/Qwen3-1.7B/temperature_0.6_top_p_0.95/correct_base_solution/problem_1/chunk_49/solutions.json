    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm.

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm.

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm.

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The problem is asking about the fate of a vesicle formed during phagocytosis. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct.

The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one with just a single letter. First, I need to recall what happens when a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where cells engulf large particles or pathogens, forming a vesicle called a phagosome. This vesicle then needs to be processed inside the cell. Now, looking at the options: Option A says the vesicle stays intact and floats freely. That doesn't sound right because phagocytosed material usually gets processed, not just floating around. So probably not A. Option B mentions merging with the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is involved in modifying, sorting, and transporting proteins and lipids. But phagosomes might merge with lysosomes later for digestion. Not sure yet. Option C suggests merging with a mitochondrion. Mitochondria are for energy production, but phagosomes are typically broken down by lysosomes. So maybe not C. Option D states the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and contents are expelled. Wait, that sounds like exocytosis, which is when something is released out of the cell. But phagocytosis forms a vesicle that's then processed. If it fuses with the membrane, maybe it's being expelled? Or is that a different process? Option E says the vesicle breaks down on its own. That seems unlikely; phagocytosis involves processing, so breaking down on its own isn't typical. Probably not E. Option F: merges with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that break down cellular waste. Since phagocytosis leads to a phagosome, which would then fuse with lysosomes to digest the ingested material. That makes sense. So F could be the answer. Option G: releases contents to the cytoplasm for digestion. That's similar to option F but more specific. However, if the vesicle (phagosome) fuses with a lysosome, then the contents are digested. But if it's releasing directly into the cytoplasm, that would be exocytosis. But phagocytosis's vesicle is usually internalized and then processed in the lysosome. So maybe G is also possible. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the \"fate\" of the vesicle. Let me think again. Phagocytosis results in a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome, where the ingested material is broken down by lysosomal enzymes. So the correct answer would be F, since the lysosome is involved here. But wait, option G says the vesicle releases contents to the cytoplasm. That would be exocytosis, but phagocytosis's vesicle is not released into the cytoplasm unless it's a mistake. So I think F is correct. Alternatively, if the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, that's exocytosis. But the phagocytosis vesicle is meant to be internalized and then processed. So the answer should be F. Let me check the options again. Yes, option F is the one where the vesicle merges with a lysosome.",
