    "rollout": " Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves two birds crossing their genes, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. There are four birds involved here: a parent bird that's homozygously checkered red (let's denote that as CC BB), and another parent bird that's plain brown (cc bb). We're looking at an adihybrid cross between these two parents.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- Gene C controls checkered patterns:\n  - Dominant (C): Checkered (let's say red)\n  - Recessive (c): Plain (let's say brown)\n\n- Gene B controls color:\n  - Dominant (B): Red\n  - Recessive (b): Brown\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. Since these are independent traits, their combination will determine the phenotype.\n\nNow, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the parents are both heterozygous for one trait but homozygous for another.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait. The first bird is CC BB, which suggests both parents have two dominant alleles for the first gene (C) and two dominant alleles for the second gene (B), making them homozygous for both traits. But wait, no\u2014the notation might be confusing. Actually, the genotype would be CC for the first gene (C) since both alleles are C, and BB for the second gene (B) since both are B. So, they're both homozygous for both traits.\n\nBut then the other parent is cc bb. That means they're homozygous for the recessive alleles for both genes. So, the first parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and the second parent is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits).\n\nWait, that can't be right because if you cross a homozygous dominant with a homozygous recessive, all offspring should be heterozygotes. But let me confirm:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nCrossing these two: Each offspring will receive one allele from each parent. From Parent 1, they'll get either C or C (since they're homozygous), and from Parent 2, they'll get either c or c. Similarly, for the second gene, Parent 1 gives B or B, and Parent 2 gives b or b.\n\nTherefore, all F1 offspring will be Cc Bb. Because from Parent 1: CC contributes C, and cc contributes c; from Parent 2: BB contributes B, and bb contributes b. So the F1 genotypes are Cc Bb.\n\nNow, F1 individuals will produce gametes using Mendel's laws. They'll be heterozygous for both genes, so the gametes will be a combination of their alleles. The possible gametes from Cc Bb are:\n\nFor gene C: C and c\nFor gene B: B and b\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\nGametes from F1: (C/B), (C/b), (c/B), (c/b)\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | C   | c\n        -----------------\n        C   | CC | Cc\n        b      | Cb | cc\n        B     | CB | CB\n        b      | CB | cb\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I should correct that. The F1s are all Cc Bb, so when crossed with themselves, the possible combinations are:\n\nEach F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. Each with equal probability (25%).\n\nWhen these F1s mate, the resulting F2 generation will have different probabilities based on the Punnett square.\n\nLet me construct the F2 Punnett square correctly.\n\nParental genotypes: Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb\n\nPossible gametes from Cc (gene C):\n- C (25%)\n- c (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for Bb (gene B):\n- B (25%)\n- b (25%)\n\nSo combining these, the F2 will have:\n\nFor gene C: 25% C, 25% c\nFor gene B: 25% B, 25% b\n\nTo find the phenotypes, we combine the alleles for each gene. Then, based on the dominance hierarchy, we determine the phenotype.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n- Dominant (C or B) = Red\n- Recessive (c or b) = Brown\n- If both dominant, the same phenotype.\n\nSo, let's consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n10. cC BB \u2192 Same as 7 (Checkered Red)\n11. cC Bb \u2192 Same as 8 (Checkered Brown)\n12. cC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n13. cc BB \u2192 Same as 4 (Checkered Red)\n14. cc Bb \u2192 Same as 5 (Checkered Brown)\n15. cc bb \u2192 Same as 6 (Plain Brown)\n16. CC cB \u2192 Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s a typo. It should be Cc Bb, not CC cB.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in constructing the Punnett square. Let me properly list all possible combinations.\n\nThe F2 will have each gene independently assorting. So for gene C, each F2 individual has a 50% chance of being C or c. Similarly for gene B, 50% chance of B or b. The combination is independent, so there are 4 possible combinations per F2 individual:\n\n1. C C \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. c C \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. c B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. c b \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. c C \u2192 Checkered Red\n8. c B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. c b \u2192 Plain Brown\n10. c C \u2192 Checkered Red\n11. c B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n12. c b \u2192 Plain Brown\n13. c C \u2192 Checkered Red\n14. c B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n15. c b \u2192 Plain Brown\n16. CC \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nWait, that seems too many, but I think I see where I went wrong earlier. Let me construct the F2 correctly.\n\nEach F2 individual is a combination of the alleles from each parent. Since each parent is Cc Bb, the F2 will have each gene independently assorting. So for gene C: 50% C, 50% c. For gene B: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nSo, the F2 will have 16 possible genotypic combinations. However, some will result in the same phenotype due to dominance.\n\nLet's count how many individuals fall into each phenotype category.\n\nCheckered Red (C_B_): All individuals where both C and B are dominant. So any genotype where C is present and B is present.\n\nLooking at the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n7. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n11. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n12. cC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n13. cC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n14. cC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n15. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n16. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but I think I overcounted. Let me approach it differently.\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals: 16.\n\nNumber of Checkered Red (C_B_):\n\nEach F2 can have C or c and B or b.\n\nIf C is present (either C or cc), and B is present (either B or bb), then the phenotype is Checkered Red.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb: Checkered Red\n\nThat's 6 cases.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Wait, no\u2014if C is present (C or cc) AND B is present (B or bb), regardless of whether they're homozygous or heterozygous.\n\nSo, the number of Checkered Red would be:\n\nFor C: 2 possibilities (C or cc)\nFor B: 2 possibilities (B or bb)\nTotal: 2x2=4 combinations where both C and B are present.\n\nBut each combination corresponds to multiple actual individuals.\n\nActually, more accurately, the number of Checkered Red individuals is the number of F2 where at least one C and at least one B allele are present. This includes:\n\n- CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb\n\nWhich is indeed 6 individuals.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered Brown (C_Bb):\n\nThis occurs when at least one C and at least one b are present.\n\nSo, the genotypes would include:\n\n- CC Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014CC Bb has C and B, but also has Bb, which doesn't add to brown unless B is present. Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of presence of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nWait, Checkered Brown would occur when at least one dominant allele (C or B) is present, but since both are present in some form, perhaps it's easier to calculate the complement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the combined probabilities can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nProbability of Checkered Red (both C and B dominant):\n\nP(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nProbability of Checkered Brown (at least one C and at least one b):\n\nThis is 1 - P(all C) - P(all b) + ... Wait, no. Actually, for the presence of at least one dominant and at least one recessive allele, it's 1 minus the probability of all dominant or all recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that for each gene, the presence of dominant or recessive affects the phenotype.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of dominant (C or B) is 3/4, since each gene has a 1/2 chance of being dominant, and they are independent.\n\nWait, no, for each gene, the probability that an individual is Checkered (dominant) is 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of being recessive), and brown is 1/4.\n\nBut when considering both genes together, the probability of Checkered overall is (3/4)^2 = 9/16? No, that's incorrect because the presence of at least one dominant allele across both genes determines the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each gene separately and then combine.\n\nFor gene C:\n\n- 50% C, 50% c\nFor gene B:\n- 50% B, 50% b\n\nThe phenotype depends on both genes. Checkered is when both C and B are present (i.e., at least one C and at least one B allele present). Brown is when either both are recessive (c and b) or only one is present.\n\nWait, actually, brown occurs when both alleles are recessive (cc bb) or when one is recessive and the other is dominant, but since brown is when the dominant allele is missing. Wait, no\u2014the dominance hierarchy is such that if at least one dominant allele is present, the animal is colored red; otherwise, it's brown.\n\nSo, brown occurs when neither C nor B is present, i.e., when both alleles are recessive (cc and bb). So, the probability of brown is (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = (0.25)*(0.25)=0.0625, or 6.25%.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 93.75% are Checkered.\n\nBut let's verify this by counting the number of Checkered Red and Checkered Brown individuals in the F2 population.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each gene segregates independently, so there are 16 possible combinations.\n\nNumber of Checkered Red (C_B_):\n\nAs established before, this is when at least one C and at least one B allele are present. In terms of F2:\n\nEach gene has 50% C and 50% c, and 50% B and 50% b.\n\nThe number of Checkered Red individuals is the number where at least one C and at least one B are present. This includes:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- CC bb: 1\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n\nWait, but that's 6 individuals, each with a unique genotype. But each of these genotypes represents one phenotype, Checkered Red. So, 6 individuals.\n\nNumber of Checkered Brown (C_bb or cc B):\n\nThese are when either C is present and B is absent (C bb) or c is present and B is present (cc B).\n\nSo, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC bb: 1\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n\nAgain, 4 individuals.\n\nWait, but hold on: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb\u2014are these four distinct genotypes?\n\nYes. So, Checkered Brown occurs in 4 individuals.\n\nAnd the rest are brown:\n\n16 total - 6 Checkered Red - 4 Checkered Brown = 6 brown individuals.\n\nWait, that adds up to 16.\n\nNow, checking the options provided:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, Checkered Red is 6, Checkered Brown is 4, and the remaining 16 - 6 -4 = 6 brown.\n\nWait, but none of the options match exactly. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount.\n\nFor Checkered Red (C_B_):\n\nEach combination where at least one C and at least one B is present. So, in F2:\n\n- CC BB: Yes\n- CC Bb: Yes\n- CC bb: Yes (but this is brown)\n- cc BB: Yes\n- cc Bb: Yes\n- cc bb: Yes (brown)\n\nSo, Checkered Red: 6 individuals.\n\nCheckered Brown (C_bb or cc B):\n\n- CC bb: Yes\n- cc BB: Yes\n- cc Bb: Yes\n- cc bb: Yes\n\nBut wait, cc BB is Checkered Red, not brown. Wait, no\u2014cc BB would be Checkered Red, since both genes are dominant. So, brown occurs only when both are recessive.\n\nSo, Checkered Brown would be:\n\n- CC bb: Yes\n- cc BB: No, because both are dominant\n- cc Bb: Yes\n- cc bb: Yes\n\nSo, that's 3 individuals: CC bb, cc Bb, cc bb.\n\nWait, but that's three, not four. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, CC bb: yes (Checkered Brown)\ncc BB: no (Checkered Red)\ncc Bb: yes (Checkered Brown)\ncc bb: yes (Checkered Brown)\n\nSo, three individuals.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4, now 3. Let me recast:\n\nFor Checkered Brown (C_bb or cc B):\n\n- CC bb: 1\n- cc BB: 0 (Checkered Red)\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n\nSo, total 3.\n\nThen, the remaining would be:\n\n16 total - 6 Checkered Red - 3 Checkered Brown = 7 brown.\n\nBut that contradicts the previous count.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the initial counts.\n\nLet me try a different approach: create a Punnett square for F2.\n\nEach parent is Cc BB and cc bb.\n\nF1: Cc Bb.\n\nF2: Genotypes are Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So, for gene C:\n\nPossible alleles: C and c (each 50%)\n\nFor gene B:\n\nPossible alleles: B and b (each 50%)\n\nThus, F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nGene C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nGene B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe Punnett square combines these:\n\nRow: Gene C alleles (CC, Cc, cc)\nColumn: Gene B alleles (BB, Bb, bb)\n\nSo,\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CC BB\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CC Bb\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 CC bb\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cc BB\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Cc bb\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc BB\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\nCheckered Red (C_B_):\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that's six individuals, all Checkered Red except CC bb and cc bb, which are Checkered Brown.\n\nWait, no: CC BB is Checkered Red, CC Bb is brown, CC bb is brown.\n\nSame for cc BB: Checkered Red, cc Bb: brown, cc bb: brown.\n\nSo, Checkered Red: 4 (from CC and cc) + 2 (from BB and bb?)

Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves two birds crossing their genes, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. There are four birds involved here: a parent bird that's homozygously checkered red (let's denote that as CC BB), and another parent bird that's plain brown (cc bb). We're looking at an adihybrid cross between these two parents.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- Gene C controls checkered patterns:\n  - Dominant (C): Checkered (let's say red)\n  - Recessive (c): Plain (let's say brown)\n\n- Gene B controls color:\n  - Dominant (B): Red\n  - Recessive (b): Brown\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. Since these are independent traits, their combination will determine the phenotype.\n\nNow, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the parents are both heterozygous for one trait but homozygous for another.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait. The first bird is CC BB, which suggests both parents have two dominant alleles for the first gene (C) and two dominant alleles for the second gene (B), making them homozygous for both traits. But wait, no\u2014the notation might be confusing. Actually, the genotype would be CC for the first gene (C) since both alleles are C, and BB for the second gene (B) since both are B. So, they're both homozygous for both traits.\n\nBut then the other parent is cc bb. That means they're homozygous for the recessive alleles for both genes. So, the first parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and the second parent is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits).\n\nWait, that can't be right because if you cross a homozygous dominant with a homozygous recessive, all offspring should be heterozygotes. But let me confirm:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both genes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nCrossing these two: Each offspring will receive one allele from each parent. From Parent 1, they'll get either C or C (since they're homozygous), and from Parent 2, they'll get either c or c. Similarly, for the second gene, Parent 1 gives B or B, and Parent 2 gives b or b.\n\nTherefore, all F1 offspring will be Cc Bb. Because from Parent 1: CC contributes C, and cc contributes c; from Parent 2: BB contributes B, and bb contributes b. So the F1 genotypes are Cc Bb.\n\nNow, F1 individuals will produce gametes using Mendel's laws. They'll be heterozygous for both genes, so the gametes will be a combination of their alleles. The possible gametes from Cc Bb are:\n\nFor gene C: C and c\nFor gene B: B and b\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\nGametes from F1: (C/B), (C/b), (c/B), (c/b)\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | C   | c\n        -----------------\n        C   | CC | Cc\n        b      | Cb | cc\n        B     | CB | CB\n        b      | CB | cb\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I should correct that. The F1s are all Cc Bb, so when crossed with themselves, the possible combinations are:\n\nEach F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. Each with equal probability (25%).\n\nWhen these F1s mate, the resulting F2 generation will have different probabilities based on the Punnett square.\n\nLet me construct the F2 Punnett square correctly.\n\nParental genotypes: Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb\n\nPossible gametes from Cc (gene C):\n- C (25%)\n- c (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for Bb (gene B):\n- B (25%)\n- b (25%)\n\nSo combining these, the F2 will have:\n\nFor gene C: 25% C, 25% c\nFor gene B: 25% B, 25% b\n\nTo find the phenotypes, we combine the alleles for each gene. Then, based on the dominance hierarchy, we determine the phenotype.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n- Dominant (C or B) = Red\n- Recessive (c or b) = Brown\n- If both dominant, the same phenotype.\n\nSo, let's consider all possible combinations:\n\n1.

Let me approach it differently.\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals: 16.\n\nNumber of Checkered Red (C_B_):\n\nEach F2 can have C or c and B or b.\n\nIf C is present (either C or cc), and B is present (either B or bb), then the phenotype is Checkered Red.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb: Checkered Red\n\nThat's 6 cases.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Wait, no\u2014if C is present (C or cc) AND B is present (B or bb), regardless of whether they're homozygous or heterozygous.\n\nSo, the number of Checkered Red would be:\n\nFor C: 2 possibilities (C or cc)\nFor B: 2 possibilities (B or bb)\nTotal: 2x2=4 combinations where both C and B are present.\n\nBut each combination corresponds to multiple actual individuals.\n\nActually, more accurately, the number of Checkered Red individuals is the number of F2 where at least one C and at least one B allele are present. This includes:\n\n- CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb\n\nWhich is indeed 6 individuals.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered Brown (C_Bb):\n\nThis occurs when at least one C and at least one b are present.\n\nSo, the genotypes would include:\n\n- CC Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014CC Bb has C and B, but also has Bb, which doesn't add to brown unless B is present. Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of presence of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nWait, Checkered Brown would occur when at least one dominant allele (C or B) is present, but since both are present in some form, perhaps it's easier to calculate the complement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the combined probabilities can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nProbability of Checkered Red (both C and B dominant):\n\nP(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nProbability of Checkered Brown (at least one C and at least one b):\n\nThis is 1 - P(all C) - P(all b) + ... Wait, no. Actually, for the presence of at least one dominant and at least one recessive allele, it's 1 minus the probability of all dominant or all recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that for each gene, the presence of dominant or recessive affects the phenotype.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of dominant (C or B) is 3/4, since each gene has a 1/2 chance of being dominant, and they are independent.\n\nWait, no, for each gene, the probability that an individual is Checkered (dominant) is 3/4 (since there's a 1/4 chance of being recessive), and brown is 1/4.\n\nBut when considering both genes together, the probability of Checkered overall is (3/4)^2 = 9/16? No, that's incorrect because the presence of at least one dominant allele across both genes determines the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each gene separately and then combine.\n\nFor gene C:\n\n- 50% C, 50% c\nFor gene B:\n- 50% B, 50% b\n\nThe phenotype depends on both genes. Checkered is when both C and B are present (i.e., at least one C and at least one B allele present). Brown is when either both are recessive (c and b) or only one is present.\n\nWait, actually, brown occurs when both alleles are recessive (cc bb) or when one is recessive and the other is dominant, but since brown is when the dominant allele is missing. Wait, no\u2014the dominance hierarchy is such that if at least one dominant allele is present, the animal is colored red; otherwise, it's brown.\n\nSo, brown occurs when neither C nor B is present, i.e., when both alleles are recessive (cc and bb). So, the probability of brown is (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = (0.25)*(0.25)=0.0625, or 6.25%.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 93.75% are Checkered.\n\nBut let's verify this by counting the number of Checkered Red and Checkered Brown individuals in the F2 population.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each gene segregates independently, so there are 16 possible combinations.\n\nNumber of Checkered Red (C_B_):\n\nAs established before, this is when at least one C and at least one B allele are present. In terms of F2:\n\nEach gene has 50% C and 50% c, and 50% B and 50% b.\n\nThe number of Checkered Red individuals is the number where at least one C and at least one B are present. This includes:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- CC bb: 1\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n\nWait, but that's 6 individuals, each with a unique genotype. But each of these genotypes represents one phenotype, Checkered Red. So, 6 individuals.\n\nNumber of Checkered Brown (C_bb or cc B):\n\nThese are when either C is present and B is absent (C bb) or c is present and B is present (cc B).\n\nSo, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC bb: 1\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n\nAgain, 4 individuals.\n\nWait, but hold on: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb\u2014are these four distinct genotypes?\n\nYes. So, Checkered Brown occurs in 4 individuals.\n\nAnd the rest are brown:\n\n16 total - 6 Checkered Red - 4 Checkered Brown = 6 brown individuals.\n\nWait, that adds up to 16.\n\nNow, checking the options provided:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, Checkered Red is 6, Checkered Brown is 4, and the remaining 16 - 6 -4 = 6 brown.\n\nWait, but none of the options match exactly. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount.\n\nFor Checkered Red (C_B_):\n\nEach combination where at least one C and at least one B is present. So, in F2:\n\n- CC BB: Yes\n- CC Bb: Yes\n- CC bb: Yes (but this is brown)\n- cc BB: Yes\n- cc Bb: Yes\n- cc bb: Yes (brown)\n\nSo, Checkered Red: 6 individuals.\n\nCheckered Brown (C_bb or cc B):\n\n- CC bb: Yes\n- cc BB: Yes\n- cc Bb: Yes\n- cc bb: Yes\n\nBut wait, cc BB is Checkered Red, not brown. Wait, no\u2014cc BB would be Checkered Red, since both genes are dominant. So, brown occurs only when both are recessive.\n\nSo, Checkered Brown would be:\n\n- CC bb: Yes\n- cc BB: No, because both are dominant\n- cc Bb: Yes\n- cc bb: Yes\n\nSo, that's 3 individuals: CC bb, cc Bb, cc bb.\n\nWait, but that's three, not four. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, CC bb: yes (Checkered Brown)\ncc BB: no (Checkered Red)\ncc Bb: yes (Checkered Brown)\ncc bb: yes (Checkered Brown)\n\nSo, three individuals.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4, now 3. Let me recast:\n\nFor Checkered Brown (C_bb or cc B):\n\n- CC bb: 1\n- cc BB: 0 (Checkered Red)\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n\nSo, total 3.\n\nThen, the remaining would be:\n\n16 total - 6 Checkered Red - 3 Checkered Brown = 7 brown.\n\nBut that contradicts the previous count.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the initial counts.\n\nLet me try a different approach: create a Punnett square for F2.\n\nEach parent is Cc BB and cc bb.\n\nF1: Cc Bb.\n\nF2: Genotypes are Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So, for gene C:\n\nPossible alleles: C and c (each 50%)\n\nFor gene B:\n\nPossible alleles: B and b (each 50%)\n\nThus, F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nGene C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nGene B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe Punnett square combines these:\n\nRow: Gene C alleles (CC, Cc, cc)\nColumn: Gene B alleles (BB, Bb, bb)\n\nSo,\n\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CC BB\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CC Bb\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 CC bb\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cc BB\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Cc bb\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc BB\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\nCheckered Red (C_B_):\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that's six individuals, all Checkered Red except CC bb and cc bb, which are Checkered Brown.\n\nWait, no: CC BB is Checkered Red, CC Bb is brown, CC bb is brown.\n\nSame for cc BB: Checkered Red, cc Bb: brown, cc bb: brown.\n\nSo, Checkered Red: 4 (from CC and cc) + 2 (from BB and bb?) Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the above list, Checkered Red includes:\n\n- CC BB\n- cc BB\n- CC bb\n- cc bb\n\nWait, no: CC BB is",

    "rollout": " Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves two birds crossed in an adihybrid cross. The parents are a heterozygote for both traits and another bird that's also heterozygous but different traits. Let me note down the given information:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB)\n- Parent 2: Plain brown bird (ccbb)\n\nWe need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. But before that, maybe I should outline what each gene pair does.\n\nLooking at the genes involved:\n- Gene C: Dominant (C) causes checkered red or some other color; recessive (c) makes plain.\n- Gene B: Dominant (B) gives red color; recessive (b) gives brown.\n- Gene b and c are separate since they're on different chromosomes.\n\nSo, the parent with CCBB has genotype for C as CC (so both C alleles), which means checkered red because C is dominant. For B, BB means both B alleles, so red color.\n\nParent ccbb has genotype for C as cc, so plain. And for B, bb, so brown.\n\nNow, the cross is between these two birds. So, first, let's think about the F1 generation.\n\nWhen you cross a heterozygote (CcBB) x (ccbb):\n\nThe possible gametes from the first bird (CcBB):\n- C (from Cc) can produce C or c\n- B (from BB) can only produce B\n\nSo, gametes are CB and cb.\n\nFrom the second bird (ccbb):\n- c (from cc) can only produce c\n- B (from bb) can only produce B\n\nGametes: cb\n\nWait, no. Wait. The second bird is ccbb, meaning their genotype is cc (for C) and bb (for B). So, when producing gametes, C would be c (since it's homozygous recessive) and B would be b.\n\nBut wait, the bird is CCBB for Parent 1 and ccbb for Parent 2? Or was I misinterpreting earlier?\n\nWait, no. The initial description says:\n\nParent 1: Checkered red bird \u2192 CCBB\n\nParent 2: Plain brown bird \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo, the F1 would come from CCBB x ccbb.\n\nSo, for the F1:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1: C (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: c (homozygous recessive)\n\nSo, F1 will have Cc for gene C.\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1: B (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: b (homozygous recessive)\n\nSo, F1 will have Bb for gene B.\n\nTherefore, the F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nBut then, we need to consider the F1 to F2 generation. Wait, the question seems to ask for the F2 generation after crossing the two birds, so actually, the parents are CCBB and ccbb, making F1 CcBb, and then F2 would be generated from F1 x F1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is asking for the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross between CCBB and ccbb. So, the parents are both heterozygotes.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (AaBb x AaBb), the F2 generation would have various combinations based on independent assortment.\n\nLet me clarify the setup again:\n\nParents are CCBB (heterozygote for both genes) and ccbb (heterozygote).\n\nCrossing them, so F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen F2 would be the next generation, where each gene assorts independently.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\nGene C: C (probability 25%) and c (75%)\n\nGene B: B (25%), b (75%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the Punnett square would have 16 combinations:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% CB\n- 25% Cb\n- 25% cb\n- 25% ccB\n- etc., up to ccbb.\n\nWait, but considering the actual genotypes of the parents:\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 Genotype: CC (C) and BB (B)\n\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 Genotype: cc (c) and bb (b)\n\nSo, when crossed, the F1 will have:\n\nFor gene C: C (from CC) and c (from cc) \u2192 Cc\n\nFor gene B: B (from BB) and b (from bb) \u2192 Bb\n\nThus, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nNow, to get F2, we need to consider selfing F1 or F1 x F1.\n\nAssuming it's F1 x F1, so dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (CcBB x CcBB?), no\u2014wait, F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be CcBb x CcBb.\n\nAlternatively, if it's F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), the Punnett square would involve all combinations.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which are both heterozygotes.\n\nSo, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the offspring from F1 x F1.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square:\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n\nGametes from Parent 1 (CcBb): C, c, B, b\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (CcBb): same.\n\nSo, each parent can produce four types of gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations in F2.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n\n- Gene C: dominant C = Checkered red; recessive c = plain\n- Gene B: dominant B = Red; recessive b = Brown\n\nSo, each combination leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet's list all possible gamete combinations and their resulting phenotypes.\n\nPossible gametes from each parent (assuming equal probability):\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CcBb): 25% C, 25% c, 25% B, 25% b\n\nSame for Parent 2.\n\nSo, F2 will consist of all combinations of these gametes.\n\nLet's go through each possible genotype and its phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way. Since the genes are independent, we can calculate the probabilities for each phenotype without listing all 16 combinations.\n\nBut to make it manageable, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nThere are four possible phenotypes based on the combination of dominant and recessive traits for both genes.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities (dominant for C, recessive for c; dominant for B, recessive for b), so overall, nine possible phenotypes. However, due to dominance, some phenotypes might combine.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio among the F2 generation's phenotypes.\n\nLet me proceed methodically.\n\nEach gene (C and B) is segregating independently.\n\nSo, for gene C:\n\nProbability of dominant C (Checkered red) = 3/4\n\nProbability of recessive c (plain) = 1/4\n\nFor gene B:\n\nProbability of dominant B (Red) = 3/4\n\nProbability of recessive b (Brown) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Both genes recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, the four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n1. C dominant * B dominant = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant * B recessive = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C recessive * B dominant = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Red\n4. C recessive * B recessive = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but none of the options provided seem to match exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions G to H are:\n\nG. 12:12:2:2 \u2192 sum to 28, not 16\n\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nWait, the total number of possible outcomes is 16, so the fractions should add up to 1.\n\nBut according to my calculation, the probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nWhich simplifies to 9:3:3:1, adding to 16.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Sum 16, but order differs.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Sum 16, but order is 3:9:1:3, which matches 9+3+1+3=16, but the order is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, for Checkered Red: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nCheckered Brown: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPlain Red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nPlain Brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which corresponds to 3/16 :9/16 :1/16 :3/16, which sums to 16 parts.\n\nBut the option labels the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nSo, Option E states:\n\ncheckered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich aligns with our calculations.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned the options starting with 'A.' and so on.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves two birds crossed in an adihybrid cross. The parents are a heterozygote for both traits and another bird that's also heterozygous but different traits. Let me note down the given information:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB)\n- Parent 2: Plain brown bird (ccbb)\n\nWe need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. But before that, maybe I should outline what each gene pair does.\n\nLooking at the genes involved:\n- Gene C: Dominant (C) causes checkered red or some other color; recessive (c) makes plain.\n- Gene B: Dominant (B) gives red color; recessive (b) gives brown.\n- Gene b and c are separate since they're on different chromosomes.\n\nSo, the parent with CCBB has genotype for C as CC (so both C alleles), which means checkered red because C is dominant. For B, BB means both B alleles, so red color.\n\nParent ccbb has genotype for C as cc, so plain. And for B, bb, so brown.\n\nNow, the cross is between these two birds. So, first, let's think about the F1 generation.\n\nWhen you cross a heterozygote (CcBB) x (ccbb):\n\nThe possible gametes from the first bird (CcBB):\n- C (from Cc) can produce C or c\n- B (from BB) can only produce B\n\nSo, gametes are CB and cb.\n\nFrom the second bird (ccbb):\n- c (from cc) can only produce c\n- B (from bb) can only produce B\n\nGametes: cb\n\nWait, no. Wait. The second bird is ccbb, meaning their genotype is cc (for C) and bb (for B). So, when producing gametes, C would be c (since it's homozygous recessive) and B would be b.\n\nBut wait, the bird is CCBB for Parent 1 and ccbb for Parent 2? Or was I misinterpreting earlier?\n\nWait, no. The initial description says:\n\nParent 1: Checkered red bird \u2192 CCBB\n\nParent 2: Plain brown bird \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo, the F1 would come from CCBB x ccbb.\n\nSo, for the F1:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1: C (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: c (homozygous recessive)\n\nSo, F1 will have Cc for gene C.\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1: B (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: b (homozygous recessive)\n\nSo, F1 will have Bb for gene B.\n\nTherefore, the F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nBut then, we need to consider the F1 to F2 generation. Wait, the question seems to ask for the F2 generation after crossing the two birds, so actually, the parents are CCBB and ccbb, making F1 CcBb, and then F2 would be generated from F1 x F1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is asking for the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross between CCBB and ccbb. So, the parents are both heterozygotes.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (AaBb x AaBb), the F2 generation would have various combinations based on independent assortment.\n\nLet me clarify the setup again:\n\nParents are CCBB (heterozygote for both genes) and ccbb (heterozygote).\n\nCrossing them, so F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen F2 would be the next generation, where each gene assorts independently.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\nGene C: C (probability 25%) and c (75%)\n\nGene B: B (25%), b (75%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the Punnett square would have 16 combinations:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% CB\n- 25% Cb\n- 25% cb\n- 25% ccB\n- etc., up to ccbb.\n\nWait, but considering the actual genotypes of the parents:\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 Genotype: CC (C) and BB (B)\n\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 Genotype: cc (c) and bb (b)\n\nSo, when crossed, the F1 will have:\n\nFor gene C: C (from CC) and c (from cc) \u2192 Cc\n\nFor gene B: B (from BB) and b (from bb) \u2192 Bb\n\nThus, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nNow, to get F2, we need to consider selfing F1 or F1 x F1.\n\nAssuming it's F1 x F1, so dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (CcBB x CcBB?), no\u2014wait, F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be CcBb x CcBb.\n\nAlternatively, if it's F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), the Punnett square would involve all combinations.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which are both heterozygotes.\n\nSo, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the offspring from F1 x F1.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square:\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n\nGametes from Parent 1 (CcBb): C, c, B, b\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (CcBb): same.\n\nSo, each parent can produce four types of gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations in F2.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n\n- Gene C: dominant C = Checkered red; recessive c = plain\n- Gene B: dominant B = Red; recessive b = Brown\n\nSo, each combination leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet's list all possible gamete combinations and their resulting phenotypes.\n\nPossible gametes from each parent (assuming equal probability):\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CcBb): 25% C, 25% c, 25% B, 25% b\n\nSame for Parent 2.\n\nSo, F2 will consist of all combinations of these gametes.\n\nLet's go through each possible genotype and its phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way. Since the genes are independent, we can calculate the probabilities for each phenotype without listing all 16 combinations.\n\nBut to make it manageable, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nThere are four possible phenotypes based on the combination of dominant and recessive traits for both genes.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities (dominant for C, recessive for c; dominant for B, recessive for b), so overall, nine possible phenotypes. However, due to dominance, some phenotypes might combine.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio among the F2 generation's phenotypes.\n\nLet me proceed methodically.\n\nEach gene (C and B) is segregating independently.\n\nSo, for gene C:\n\nProbability of dominant C (Checkered red) = 3/4\n\nProbability of recessive c (plain) = 1/4\n\nFor gene B:\n\nProbability of dominant B (Red) = 3/4\n\nProbability of recessive b (Brown) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Both genes recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, the four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n1. C dominant * B dominant = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant * B recessive = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C recessive * B dominant = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain Red\n4. C recessive * B recessive = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but none of the options provided seem to match exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions G to H are:\n\nG. 12:12:2:2 \u2192 sum to 28, not 16\n\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nWait, the total number of possible outcomes is 16, so the fractions should add up to 1.\n\nBut according to my calculation, the probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nWhich simplifies to 9:3:3:1, adding to 16.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Sum 16, but order differs.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Sum 16, but order is 3:9:1:3, which matches 9+3+1+3=16, but the order is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, for Checkered Red: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nCheckered Brown: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nPlain Red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nPlain Brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which corresponds to 3/16 :9/16 :1/16 :3/16, which sums to 16 parts.\n\nBut the option labels the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nSo, Option E states:\n\ncheckered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich aligns with our calculations.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned the options starting with 'A.' and so on. Let me confirm the options:\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled from A to J, with each having specific numbers.\n\nFor example:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,2,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,2\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nSo, Option E is 3:9:1:3, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but in the options, E is written as \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the options start with A, but let me double-check.\n\nNo, the options are listed as:\n\nA. ... \n\nE. ... \n\nSo, yes, Option E is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nWe have two birds crossing, one that's a homozygous checkered red (CCBB) and another that's plain brown (ccbb). We need to create a Punnett square for an adihybridcross between them. Then, we're supposed to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation based on the given options.\n\nFirst, let me break down the genes involved:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant C leads to checkered pigeons, recessive c leads to plain.\n- Gene B: Dominant B results in red, recessive b gives brown.\n  \nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene, right? Let me list the possible gametes they can produce.\n\nFor the first parent, CCBB:\n- They'll produce gametes where both C and B are present since they're homozygous. So, all their gametes will be CB.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, CCBB has two C's and two B's, while ccbb has two c's and two b's. Therefore, the F1 generation should get one C from CCBB and one c from ccbb for the C gene, and similarly for B and b.\n\nSo, the F1 should be CcBb.\n\nNow, when we make the Punnett square for F1 x F1, which would be CcBb x CcBb.\n\nEach gene is independent, so I can handle them separately and then combine the results.\n\nLet me tackle each gene one by one.\n\nStarting with gene C (dominant C = checkered, recessive c = plain):\nIn F1, the genotype is Cc. So, the gametes produced will be C (homozygote) and c (heterozygote), each at equal probability (50% each).\n\nSimilarly, for gene B (dominant B = red, recessive b = brown):\nThe F1 genotype is Bb. So, the gametes will be B (homozygote) and b (heterozygote), again 50% each.\n\nSince these genes assort independently, the F2 genotypes can be found by combining the possibilities of each gene.\n\nBut wait, the question specifically asks about the F2 generation, not F1. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me recheck.\n\nNo, actually, the question says \"for the F2 generation,\" but the parents are CCBB and ccbb. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, because if you cross a homozygous CcBb (F1) with another F1, you'd get F2, but F1 itself isn't technically F2 unless you're starting from F1. Maybe the question intended to refer to the F1 generation as F2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Let me clarify.\n\nIf we consider the initial cross as F1, then F2 would result from F1 x F1. But the options provided seem to suggest that the F2 is the correct focus. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F1 as F2, which might not be standard terminology. Perhaps it's better to proceed with the assumption that the question refers to the F2 generation resulting from F1 x F1.\n\nGiven that, let's construct the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb, meaning they can produce four types of gametes:\n\n1. C_B_ (from C and B)\n2. C_bb (from C and b)\n3. ccB_ (from c and B)\n4. ccbb (from c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 individual has the genotype CcBb, so each gamete will have either C or c for the C locus and B or b for the B locus. Since both genes are linked, but assuming independent assortment, the gametes are combinations of these.\n\nSo, the possible gametes are:\n\n- C_B_ (probability 25%)\n- C_bb (25%)\n- ccB_ (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would consist of the F1 individuals crossed together, resulting in four possible combinations for each gene.\n\nTo find the phenotypes, I need to look at the combination of the alleles for both genes.\n\nLet's outline all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nBut before that, perhaps using a Punnett square approach would help. Each F1 (CcBB/ ccbb?) Wait, no. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB and ccbb, so each F1 would be CcBb, right?\n\nWait, no\u2014let me think again. The parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, each F1 would receive one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nFor gene C:\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\nSo F1 genotype: Cc\n\nFor gene B:\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\nSo F1 genotype: Bb\n\nThus, F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F2 would result from F1 x F1, producing four possible gametes as above.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the F2 directly without considering F1. Let me see.\n\nWait, but the question seems to be asking about the F2 generation after crossing a homozygous CcBb (if F1 is CcBb) with another CcBb, making F2. But the initial parents were CCBB (which would be CcBb) and ccbb (which is also CcBb?), no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014it's CCBB (so C is dominant, so the bird is checkered, and B is dominant, so it's red), and ccbb (plain, brown). So each parent is CcBb.\n\nWhen crossed, F1 would be CcBb x CcBb, and F2 would be F1 x F1.\n\nSo, perhaps I should build the Punnett square for F2.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb, so each gamete is a combination of C/B and c/b.\n\nThe F2 will consist of the F1 individuals crossed together, leading to four possible combinations for each gene.\n\nSo, for gene C:\n\nPossible gametes: C (25%), c (25%)\n\nFor gene B:\n\nPossible gametes: B (25%), b (25%)\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nCC BB \u2192 CcBb\nCC bb \u2192 Ccbb\ncc BB \u2192 ccBB\ncc bb \u2192 ccbb\n\nBut wait, I think I've missed some combinations. Actually, each gene's gametes are independent, so the F2 will have combinations like:\n\nFor gene C: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc\nFor gene B: 25% BB, 25% Bb, 25% bB, 25% bb\n\nBut when combined, the F2 genotypes will include all combinations of these, such as CC BB (25%), CC Bb (25%), CC bb (25%), etc., totaling 16%.\n\nHowever, the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles for both genes.\n\nSo, let's map the phenotypes:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - Dominant C (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype A\n  - Recessive c \u2192 Phenotype B\n\n- For gene B:\n  - Dominant B \u2192 Phenotype C\n  - Recessive b \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, the phenotype of each bird is determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nNow, let's determine how many of each phenotype there are in the F2.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (from Cc or CC) and B (from BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype A.C\n2. C (from Cc or CC) and b (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype A.D\n3. c (from cc) and B (from BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype B.C\n4. c (from cc) and b (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype B.D\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nThe number of each genotype is 16% for each unique combination, but let's calculate the actual counts.\n\nAssuming a large population, the ratios are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A.C (C and B): 25% (CC BB)\n- Phenotype A.D (C and b): 25% (CC bb)\n- Phenotype B.C (c and B): 25% (cc BB)\n- Phenotype B.D (c and b): 25% (cc bb)\n\nWait, but that's just the product of the probabilities for each gene. However, when considering all possible combinations, it's more accurate to say that each combination occurs with a certain frequency.\n\nWait, no\u2014if you have two independent loci, the frequency of each phenotype is the product of the frequencies of the respective alleles. But in reality, each trait is expressed independently based on its own gene.\n\nActually, the correct way is to multiply the probabilities for each gene independently. Since the two genes are independent, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nPhenotype A.C (C and B):\nProbability = (frequency of C) * (frequency of B) = (2/3) * (3/4) = 1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8 \u2192 37.5%\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype A.D (C and b):\nFrequency = (2/3) * (1/4) = 2/3 * 1/4 = 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n\nPhenotype B.C (c and B):\nFrequency = (1/3) * (3/4) = 1/3 * 3/4 = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype B.D (c and b):\nFrequency = (1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12 \u2248 8.33%\n\nAdding these up: 37.5% + 16.67% + 25% + 8.33% = 87.5%, which accounts for all possibilities.\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up to 100%. There must be a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, no\u2014the error is that the frequency for each phenotype is calculated as the product of the probabilities for each trait. For example, for Pheno A.C, it's the probability of having at least one dominant allele for C times the probability of having at least one dominant allele for B.\n\nBut actually, the phenotypic expression depends on whether the individual is expressing the dominant or recessive trait for each gene.\n\nSo, for Pheno A.C (C and B):\n\nThe probability is the chance of having at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B.\n\nWhich is (1 - (probability of both recessive)) \u2192 1 - (prob(c) * prob(b)) = 1 - (1/3 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/12 = 11/12 \u2248 91.67%\n\nWait, that's different than what I thought earlier.\n\nHmm, perhaps I confused the calculation earlier.\n\nLet me recalculate the frequencies properly.\n\nFor each phenotype, the probability is the product of the probabilities of the dominant trait for each gene.\n\nSo,\n\nPhenotype A.C (C and B):\n\nProbability = [1 - (prob(c for C))] * [1 - (prob(b for B))] \n\nBecause for a bird to express C (C_ or CC), it needs at least one dominant C allele, which is 1 - (prob(cc)) = 1 - (1/3 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/12 = 11/12 \u2248 91.67%\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype A.D (C and b):\n\nProbability = [1 - (prob(c for C))] * [prob(b for B)] = 11/12 * 1/4 = 11/48 \u2248 22.92%\n\nPhenotype B.C (c and B):\n\nProbability = [prob(c for C)] * [1 - (prob(b for B))] = 1/3 * 11/4 = 11/12 \u2248 87.5%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because for Pheno B.C, the bird must have at least one dominant B allele (since B is expressed), which is always true except when both are recessive, i.e., when both are b. Wait, no\u2014phenotype B.C means the bird is expressed as B (B_ or BB), regardless of the C allele.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability of at least one dominant B allele, which is 1 - (prob(bb)). Since for B, the recessive allele is b, and the probability of being bb is (1/3)^2 = 1/9, so 1 - 1/9 = 8/9 \u2248 88.89%\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, for each bird, we need to compute the probability that they exhibit each combination of traits.\n\nThe total probability for each phenotype is the sum over all possible genotypes that result in that phenotype of their respective probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better method is to use a Punnett square for both genes and then count the phenotypes.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nFirst, for gene C:\n\nParents: Cc x Cc\n\nPossible gametes:\n- C (25%)\n- c (25%)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\nParents: BB x bb\n\nPossible gametes:\n- B (25%)\n- b (25%)\n\nSo, the F2 for each gene:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, the F2 bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nLet's enumerate all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (from Cc or CC) and B (from BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype A.C\n2. C (from Cc or CC) and b (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype A.D\n3. c (from cc) and B (from BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype B.C\n4. c (from cc) and b (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype B.D\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nPhenotype A.C:\nProbability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B)\n= (2/3) * (3/4) = 6/12 = 1/2 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype A.D:\nProbability = (2/3) * (1/4) = 2/12 = 1/6 \u2192 16.67%\n\nPhenotype B.C:\nProbability = (1/3) * (3/4) = 3/12 = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype B.D:\nProbability = (1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12 \u2192 8.33%\n\nAdding these up: 50% + 16.67% + 25% + 8.33% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these percentages into numbers based on the F2 generation.\n\nSuppose we have 16 birds (for simplicity, though in reality, the numbers are much larger due to genetic ratios). \n\n- Phenotype A.C (50%): 8 birds\n- Phenotype A.D (16.67%): ~3 birds\n- Phenotype B.C (25%): 4 birds\n- Phenotype B.D (8.33%): ~2 birds\n\nTotal: 8 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 17, which is close to 16, likely rounding errors.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThis corresponds to Phenotype A.C (checkered red) = 9, A.D (checkered brown)=3, B.C (plain red)=3, B.D (plain brown)=1. This doesn't match our calculation of 8,3,4,2.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis is similar but swapped.\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nAgain, different numbers.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNot matching.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nThis matches exactly with our calculation (8,3,4,2) rounded, but the exact ratio is 8:3:4:2.\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match. Option G is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to 8:3:4:2 rounded. So, option G is closest.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, it's 8:3:4:2, which could be approximated as 9:3:3:1 if we round differently, but that's not ideal. So, none of the options perfectly match, but option G is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the F2 generation.\n\nEach parent is CcBb. When crossed, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but considering both genes together, the phenotypic ratio may differ.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the F2 generation, not F1. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"the F2 generation.\" Wait, but the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which are CcBb and CcBb. So, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be F1 x F1.\n\nWait, but in any case, the answer options don't include a ratio that closely matches our calculated 8:3:4:2. The closest is option G: 9:3:3:1, but that's not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recount the F2 phenotypic ratios correctly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nThe possible genotypes are",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nWe have two birds crossing, one that's a homozygous checkered red (CCBB) and another that's plain brown (ccbb). We need to create a Punnett square for an adihybridcross between them. Then, we're supposed to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation based on the given options.\n\nFirst, let me break down the genes involved:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant C leads to checkered pigeons, recessive c leads to plain.\n- Gene B: Dominant B results in red, recessive b gives brown.\n  \nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene, right?

So, all their gametes will be CB.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, CCBB has two C's and two B's, while ccbb has two c's and two b's. Therefore, the F1 generation should get one C from CCBB and one c from ccbb for the C gene, and similarly for B and b.\n\nSo, the F1 should be CcBb.\n\nNow, when we make the Punnett square for F1 x F1, which would be CcBb x CcBb.\n\nEach gene is independent, so I can handle them separately and then combine the results.\n\nLet me tackle each gene one by one.\n\nStarting with gene C (dominant C = checkered, recessive c = plain):\nIn F1, the genotype is Cc. So, the gametes produced will be C (homozygote) and c (heterozygote), each at equal probability (50% each).\n\nSimilarly, for gene B (dominant B = red, recessive b = brown):\nThe F1 genotype is Bb. So, the gametes will be B (homozygote) and b (heterozygote), again 50% each.\n\nSince these genes assort independently, the F2 genotypes can be found by combining the possibilities of each gene.\n\nBut wait, the question specifically asks about the F2 generation, not F1. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me recheck.\n\nNo, actually, the question says \"for the F2 generation,\" but the parents are CCBB and ccbb. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, because if you cross a homozygous CcBb (F1) with another F1, you'd get F2, but F1 itself isn't technically F2 unless you're starting from F1. Maybe the question intended to refer to the F1 generation as F2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Let me clarify.\n\nIf we consider the initial cross as F1, then F2 would result from F1 x F1. But the options provided seem to suggest that the F2 is the correct focus. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F1 as F2, which might not be standard terminology. Perhaps it's better to proceed with the assumption that the question refers to the F2 generation resulting from F1 x F1.\n\nGiven that, let's construct the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb, meaning they can produce four types of gametes:\n\n1. C_B_ (from C and B)\n2. C_bb (from C and b)\n3. ccB_ (from c and B)\n4. ccbb (from c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 individual has the genotype CcBb, so each gamete will have either C or c for the C locus and B or b for the B locus. Since both genes are linked, but assuming independent assortment, the gametes are combinations of these.\n\nSo, the possible gametes are:\n\n- C_B_ (probability 25%)\n- C_bb (25%)\n- ccB_ (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would consist of the F1 individuals crossed together, resulting in four possible combinations for each gene.\n\nTo find the phenotypes, I need to look at the combination of the alleles for both genes.\n\nLet's outline all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nBut before that, perhaps using a Punnett square approach would help. Each F1 (CcBB/ ccbb?) Wait, no. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB and ccbb, so each F1 would be CcBb, right?\n\nWait, no\u2014let me think again. The parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, each F1 would receive one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nFor gene C:\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\nSo F1 genotype: Cc\n\nFor gene B:\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\nSo F1 genotype: Bb\n\nThus, F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F2 would result from F1 x F1, producing four possible gametes as above.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the F2 directly without considering F1. Let me see.\n\nWait, but the question seems to be asking about the F2 generation after crossing a homozygous CcBb (if F1 is CcBb) with another CcBb, making F2. But the initial parents were CCBB (which would be CcBb) and ccbb (which is also CcBb?), no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014it's CCBB (so C is dominant, so the bird is checkered, and B is dominant, so it's red), and ccbb (plain, brown). So each parent is CcBb.\n\nWhen crossed, F1 would be CcBb x CcBb, and F2 would be F1 x F1.\n\nSo, perhaps I should build the Punnett square for F2.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb, so each gamete is a combination of C/B and c/b.\n\nThe F2 will consist of the F1 individuals crossed together, leading to four possible combinations for each gene.\n\nSo, for gene C:\n\nPossible gametes: C (25%), c (25%)\n\nFor gene B:\n\nPossible gametes: B (25%), b (25%)\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nCC BB \u2192 CcBb\nCC bb \u2192 Ccbb\ncc BB \u2192 ccBB\ncc bb \u2192 ccbb\n\nBut wait, I think I've missed some combinations. Actually, each gene's gametes are independent, so the F2 will have combinations like:\n\nFor gene C: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc\nFor gene B: 25% BB, 25% Bb, 25% bB, 25% bb\n\nBut when combined, the F2 genotypes will include all combinations of these, such as CC BB (25%), CC Bb (25%), CC bb (25%), etc., totaling 16%.\n\nHowever, the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles for both genes.\n\nSo, let's map the phenotypes:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - Dominant C (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype A\n  - Recessive c \u2192 Phenotype B\n\n- For gene B:\n  - Dominant B \u2192 Phenotype C\n  - Recessive b \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo, the phenotype of each bird is determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nNow, let's determine how many of each phenotype there are in the F2.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (from Cc or CC) and B (from BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype A.C\n2. C (from Cc or CC) and b (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype A.D\n3. c (from cc) and B (from BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype B.C\n4. c (from cc) and b (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype B.D\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nThe number of each genotype is 16% for each unique combination, but let's calculate the actual counts.\n\nAssuming a large population, the ratios are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A.C (C and B): 25% (CC BB)\n- Phenotype A.D (C and b): 25% (CC bb)\n- Phenotype B.C (c and B): 25% (cc BB)\n- Phenotype B.D (c and b): 25% (cc bb)\n\nWait, but that's just the product of the probabilities for each gene. However, when considering all possible combinations, it's more accurate to say that each combination occurs with a certain frequency.\n\nWait, no\u2014if you have two independent loci, the frequency of each phenotype is the product of the frequencies of the respective alleles. But in reality, each trait is expressed independently based on its own gene.\n\nActually, the correct way is to multiply the probabilities for each gene independently. Since the two genes are independent, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nPhenotype A.C (C and B):\nProbability = (frequency of C) * (frequency of B) = (2/3) * (3/4) = 1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8 \u2192 37.5%\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype A.D (C and b):\nFrequency = (2/3) * (1/4) = 2/3 * 1/4 = 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n\nPhenotype B.C (c and B):\nFrequency = (1/3) * (3/4) = 1/3 * 3/4 = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype B.D (c and b):\nFrequency = (1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12 \u2248 8.33%\n\nAdding these up: 37.5% + 16.67% + 25% + 8.33% = 87.5%, which accounts for all possibilities.\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up to 100%. There must be a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, no\u2014the error is that the frequency for each phenotype is calculated as the product of the probabilities for each trait. For example, for Pheno A.C, it's the probability of having at least one dominant allele for C times the probability of having at least one dominant allele for B.\n\nBut actually, the phenotypic expression depends on whether the individual is expressing the dominant or recessive trait for each gene.\n\nSo, for Pheno A.C (C and B):\n\nThe probability is the chance of having at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B.\n\nWhich is (1 - (probability of both recessive)) \u2192 1 - (prob(c) * prob(b)) = 1 - (1/3 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/12 = 11/12 \u2248 91.67%\n\nWait, that's different than what I thought earlier.\n\nHmm, perhaps I confused the calculation earlier.\n\nLet me recalculate the frequencies properly.\n\nFor each phenotype, the probability is the product of the probabilities of the dominant trait for each gene.\n\nSo,\n\nPhenotype A.C (C and B):\n\nProbability = [1 - (prob(c for C))] * [1 - (prob(b for B))] \n\nBecause for a bird to express C (C_ or CC), it needs at least one dominant C allele, which is 1 - (prob(cc)) = 1 - (1/3 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/12 = 11/12 \u2248 91.67%\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPhenotype A.D (C and b):\n\nProbability = [1 - (prob(c for C))] * [prob(b for B)] = 11/12 * 1/4 = 11/48 \u2248 22.92%\n\nPhenotype B.C (c and B):\n\nProbability = [prob(c for C)] * [1 - (prob(b for B))] = 1/3 * 11/4 = 11/12 \u2248 87.5%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because for Pheno B.C, the bird must have at least one dominant B allele (since B is expressed), which is always true except when both are recessive, i.e., when both are b. Wait, no\u2014phenotype B.C means the bird is expressed as B (B_ or BB), regardless of the C allele.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability of at least one dominant B allele, which is 1 - (prob(bb)). Since for B, the recessive allele is b, and the probability of being bb is (1/3)^2 = 1/9, so 1 - 1/9 = 8/9 \u2248 88.89%\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, for each bird, we need to compute the probability that they exhibit each combination of traits.\n\nThe total probability for each phenotype is the sum over all possible genotypes that result in that phenotype of their respective probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better method is to use a Punnett square for both genes and then count the phenotypes.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nFirst, for gene C:\n\nParents: Cc x Cc\n\nPossible gametes:\n- C (25%)\n- c (25%)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\nParents: BB x bb\n\nPossible gametes:\n- B (25%)\n- b (25%)\n\nSo, the F2 for each gene:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, the F2 bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nLet's enumerate all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (from Cc or CC) and B (from BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype A.C\n2. C (from Cc or CC) and b (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype A.D\n3. c (from cc) and B (from BB or Bb) \u2192 Phenotype B.C\n4. c (from cc) and b (from bb) \u2192 Phenotype B.D\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nPhenotype A.C:\nProbability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B)\n= (2/3) * (3/4) = 6/12 = 1/2 \u2192 50%\n\nPhenotype A.D:\nProbability = (2/3) * (1/4) = 2/12 = 1/6 \u2192 16.67%\n\nPhenotype B.C:\nProbability = (1/3) * (3/4) = 3/12 = 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nPhenotype B.D:\nProbability = (1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12 \u2192 8.33%\n\nAdding these up: 50% + 16.67% + 25% + 8.33% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these percentages into numbers based on the F2 generation.\n\nSuppose we have 16 birds (for simplicity, though in reality, the numbers are much larger due to genetic ratios). \n\n- Phenotype A.C (50%): 8 birds\n- Phenotype A.D (16.67%): ~3 birds\n- Phenotype B.C (25%): 4 birds\n- Phenotype B.D (8.33%): ~2 birds\n\nTotal: 8 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 17, which is close to 16, likely rounding errors.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThis corresponds to Phenotype A.C (checkered red) = 9, A.D (checkered brown)=3, B.C (plain red)=3, B.D (plain brown)=1. This doesn't match our calculation of 8,3,4,2.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis is similar but swapped.\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nAgain, different numbers.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNot matching.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nThis matches exactly with our calculation (8,3,4,2) rounded, but the exact ratio is 8:3:4:2.\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match. Option G is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to 8:3:4:2 rounded. So, option G is closest.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, it's 8:3:4:2, which could be approximated as 9:3:3:1 if we round differently, but that's not ideal. So, none of the options perfectly match, but option G is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the F2 generation.\n\nEach parent is CcBb. When crossed, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but considering both genes together, the phenotypic ratio may differ.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the F2 generation, not F1. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"the F2 generation.\" Wait, but the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which are CcBb and CcBb. So, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be F1 x F1.\n\nWait, but in any case, the answer options don't include a ratio that closely matches our calculated 8:3:4:2. The closest is option G: 9:3:3:1, but that's not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recount the F2 phenotypic ratios correctly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nThe possible genotypes are",

    "chunk_resampled": "Let me break it down step by step because it's a bit complex.",
    "rollout": " Let me break it down step by step because it's a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the question involves two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird and another is a plain brown bird. We need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between them. Then, we have to determine the phenotypic ratio, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nLet me start by understanding the genetic basis of the traits involved. There are two pairs of genes here:\n\n1. Gene C: This determines the color of the bird. C is dominant for checkered red, and c is recessive for plain red.\n2. Gene B: This determines the color of the body. B is dominant for brown, and b is recessive for checkered brown.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem statement, it says that red is controlled by gene C, and brown by gene B. So perhaps each trait has its own pair? Or maybe there are separate loci for each trait. Hmm, but typically, if they're different traits under the same locus, you'd use a diallelic system. But since it's mentioned as two separate traits, maybe they're on different loci or linked.\n\nBut let's proceed. Each bird is heterozygous for both genes, except for the first bird which might be homozygous. Wait no\u2014the first bird is homozygous checkered red. Since it's homozygous, it must have the genotype CC for the C gene, and BB for the B gene. Because checkered red would require at least one dominant allele for each gene. Similarly, the other bird is plain brown, which would be cc for the C gene and bb for the B gene.\n\nSo the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (for C) \u00d7 BB (for B), making it CC BB (assuming the loci are independent). So their genotype is Cc for each gene, but wait, hold on. Wait, parent 1 is homozygous checkered red, so it should be CC for C and BB for B. Wait, that can't be right because if both genes are dominant, then it's CC BB, meaning both loci are dominant. But then the other parent is cc bb, meaning both loci are recessive.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because if the first bird were homozygous for both traits, it would have to be CC BB, which is unusual. Usually, a homozygous bird would have two copies of the same allele. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-express the parents correctly. If the first bird is a homozygous checkered red, it means it's CC for the C gene and BB for the B gene. But that seems impossible because it can't have both alleles the same unless it's homozygous for both. Alternatively, perhaps the first bird is CC for C and BB for B, making it CC BB. But that would mean it's CC for C and BB for B, which together make it CC BB. That makes sense because it's homozygous for both traits. So the first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb.\n\nNow, when these two birds mate, the offspring will get one allele from each parent. So for the C gene, parent 1 contributes either C or C (since it's homozygous), and parent 2 contributes either c or c. So the possible gametes from parent 1 are CC and BB, but wait, no\u2014that's not correct because a bird with genotype CC BB can produce gametes that combine both alleles. Actually, the bird is CC BB, so it can produce gametes that are CB, CB, BB, or BB\u2014wait, no, that's incorrect because the bird is diploid for each gene separately. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid individual, so each gene is independent, so for the C locus, it's CC, and for B, it's BB. So when crossed, the gametes would be CB for both genes. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is CC BB, then for each gene, the gamete would be C and B respectively. So each gamete combines both alleles. Therefore, all gametes would be CB.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. A bird with genotype CC BB (two Cs and two Bs) can only contribute gametes that carry both alleles. So each gamete would be CB, meaning it carries one C and one B allele.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is cc bb. It can only produce gametes cb, carrying one c and one b allele.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation from this cross would consist of all possible combinations of CB and cb. So the F1 genotype would be Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb?\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is the result of the parents' gametes combining. So each F1 bird is the combination of one gamete from each parent. Since the first parent can only give CB and the second can only give cb, the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each bird is diploid, so each F1 bird would have two chromosomes. So each chromosome would receive one allele from each parent. So from the first parent, it gets CB, and from the second, cb, so the F1 bird would be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, but that would mean all F1s are Cc Bb. Then, the F1 would produce gametes Cc and Bb, leading to F2 with a 25% chance of each genotype: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. But wait, that's assuming independent assortment. However, in reality, sometimes genes are linked, so the assortment isn't independent. But the problem states to assume independent assortment, so I'll proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, but the initial parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 would be Cc Bb, as I thought earlier. Now, the F1 is crossed with itself to form the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but in the problem description, the F1 is listed as having gametes CB and cb, implying that the F1 is Cc Bb. But when F1 is crossed with F1, the F2 would have various genotypes. However, the problem asks about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents given. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the terms are confusing. Maybe it's not about dihybrid crosses but something else. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each trait independently, leading to a monohybrid cross for each gene. But the question mentions both C and B, so it's more likely a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their F1 would be Cc Bb. When F1 is crossed with F1, the F2 would be as follows:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So for the C locus, F1 has a 50% chance of being C and 50% of c. Same for the B locus. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nCC BB (25%), CC Bb (25%), CC bb (25%), cc BB (25%), cc Bb (25%), cc bb (25%).\n\nWait, but that's 6 outcomes, but in reality, some phenotypes may be similar due to dominance. So perhaps I should calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the dominant and recessive traits.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Dominant (C) = Checkered red (dominant)\n- Recessive (c) = Plain red (recessive)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Dominant (B) = Brown (dominant)\n- Recessive (b) = Checkered brown (recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes depend on both loci. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain red, Brown\n5. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nNow, let's categorize each into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Plain red, Brown\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red, Brown: Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red, Checkered brown: Cases 2, 3 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain red, Brown: Case 4 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red, Checkered brown: Cases 5, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, that adds up to 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8, but the options provided don't include 8. Wait, but the options suggest a total of 8 in some categories. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me list each possibility:\n\n- Cases where both traits are dominant: CC BB (Checkered red, Brown), CC Bb (Checkered red, Checkered brown), CC bb (Checkered red, Checkered brown) \u2192 3 cases\n- Cases where only one trait is dominant: cc BB (Plain red, Brown), cc Bb (Plain red, Checkered brown), cc bb (Plain red, Checkered brown) \u2192 3 cases\n- Cases where neither trait is dominant: CC BB is already counted as dominant, so perhaps no pure recessive cases. Wait, no\u2014the recessive cases are where both are recessive. CC BB is dominant, so any bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene would have at least one dominant trait. Only the plain red and plain brown would be the recessive ones.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier breakdown, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red, Brown\n2. Checkered red, Checkered brown\n3. Plain red, Brown\n4. Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nAnd each of these occurs 3, 2, 1, and 2 times respectively.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the answer choices are:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of the options match my calculation. Did I miscount?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, looking back, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red, Brown: Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3\n2. Checkered red, Checkered brown: Cases 2, 3 \u2192 2\n3. Plain red, Brown: Case 4 \u2192 1\n4. Plain red, Checkered brown: Cases 5, 6 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8, but the options have totals like 6, 8, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. For example, in some contexts, the order matters, such as whether the C or B trait is considered first. But in the absence of specific instructions, I think the standard approach applies: dominant traits take precedence over recessive ones.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 1+3+9+3=16, which is the total number of F2 individuals (4x4 grid).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including those that didn't arise in the cross described. Wait, but in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F2 would indeed follow the Mendelian ratio.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:1:2, which is 8 total. None of the options match exactly. Let me look again.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nSum: 5+3+2+6=16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I miscalculated the number of each phenotype.

Wait, no\u2014each parent produces 4 types of gametes, but in this case, both parents produce the same set of gametes, so the F2 should have 16 birds. Wait, no, the F2 is generated from selfing an individual who has both dominant alleles, so the number of possible phenotypes depends on how many distinct genotypes there are.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the F2 generation. Let me consider the actual F2 generation from the cross described.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u00d7 Parent 2: cc bb.\n\nCross results in F1: Cc Bb.\n\nF1 selfed: F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for each gene, the F2 will have a 50% chance of being dominant (C or B) and 50% recessive (c or b). Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C: CC, Cc, cc\nFor B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nCombining these, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red, Brown\n2.

Now, assigning phenotypes based on dominant/recessive:\n\n- 3 cases where both traits are dominant: Checkered red, Brown\n- 2 cases where one trait is dominant and the other is recessive: Checkered red, Checkered brown\n- 1 case where one trait is recessive and the other is dominant: Plain red, Brown\n- 2 cases where both traits are recessive: Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:1:2.\n\nBut none of the options match this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me break it down step by step because it's a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the question involves two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird and another is a plain brown bird. We need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between them. Then, we have to determine the phenotypic ratio, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nLet me start by understanding the genetic basis of the traits involved. There are two pairs of genes here:\n\n1. Gene C: This determines the color of the bird. C is dominant for checkered red, and c is recessive for plain red.\n2. Gene B: This determines the color of the body. B is dominant for brown, and b is recessive for checkered brown.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem statement, it says that red is controlled by gene C, and brown by gene B. So perhaps each trait has its own pair? Or maybe there are separate loci for each trait. Hmm, but typically, if they're different traits under the same locus, you'd use a diallelic system. But since it's mentioned as two separate traits, maybe they're on different loci or linked.\n\nBut let's proceed. Each bird is heterozygous for both genes, except for the first bird which might be homozygous. Wait no\u2014the first bird is homozygous checkered red. Since it's homozygous, it must have the genotype CC for the C gene, and BB for the B gene. Because checkered red would require at least one dominant allele for each gene. Similarly, the other bird is plain brown, which would be cc for the C gene and bb for the B gene.\n\nSo the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (for C) \u00d7 BB (for B), making it CC BB (assuming the loci are independent). So their genotype is Cc for each gene, but wait, hold on. Wait, parent 1 is homozygous checkered red, so it should be CC for C and BB for B. Wait, that can't be right because if both genes are dominant, then it's CC BB, meaning both loci are dominant. But then the other parent is cc bb, meaning both loci are recessive.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because if the first bird were homozygous for both traits, it would have to be CC BB, which is unusual. Usually, a homozygous bird would have two copies of the same allele. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-express the parents correctly. If the first bird is a homozygous checkered red, it means it's CC for the C gene and BB for the B gene. But that seems impossible because it can't have both alleles the same unless it's homozygous for both. Alternatively, perhaps the first bird is CC for C and BB for B, making it CC BB. But that would mean it's CC for C and BB for B, which together make it CC BB. That makes sense because it's homozygous for both traits. So the first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb.\n\nNow, when these two birds mate, the offspring will get one allele from each parent. So for the C gene, parent 1 contributes either C or C (since it's homozygous), and parent 2 contributes either c or c. So the possible gametes from parent 1 are CC and BB, but wait, no\u2014that's not correct because a bird with genotype CC BB can produce gametes that combine both alleles. Actually, the bird is CC BB, so it can produce gametes that are CB, CB, BB, or BB\u2014wait, no, that's incorrect because the bird is diploid for each gene separately. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid individual, so each gene is independent, so for the C locus, it's CC, and for B, it's BB. So when crossed, the gametes would be CB for both genes. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is CC BB, then for each gene, the gamete would be C and B respectively. So each gamete combines both alleles. Therefore, all gametes would be CB.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. A bird with genotype CC BB (two Cs and two Bs) can only contribute gametes that carry both alleles. So each gamete would be CB, meaning it carries one C and one B allele.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is cc bb. It can only produce gametes cb, carrying one c and one b allele.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation from this cross would consist of all possible combinations of CB and cb. So the F1 genotype would be Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb?\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is the result of the parents' gametes combining. So each F1 bird is the combination of one gamete from each parent. Since the first parent can only give CB and the second can only give cb, the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each bird is diploid, so each F1 bird would have two chromosomes. So each chromosome would receive one allele from each parent. So from the first parent, it gets CB, and from the second, cb, so the F1 bird would be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, but that would mean all F1s are Cc Bb. Then, the F1 would produce gametes Cc and Bb, leading to F2 with a 25% chance of each genotype: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. But wait, that's assuming independent assortment. However, in reality, sometimes genes are linked, so the assortment isn't independent. But the problem states to assume independent assortment, so I'll proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, but the initial parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 would be Cc Bb, as I thought earlier. Now, the F1 is crossed with itself to form the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but in the problem description, the F1 is listed as having gametes CB and cb, implying that the F1 is Cc Bb. But when F1 is crossed with F1, the F2 would have various genotypes. However, the problem asks about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents given. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the terms are confusing. Maybe it's not about dihybrid crosses but something else. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each trait independently, leading to a monohybrid cross for each gene. But the question mentions both C and B, so it's more likely a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their F1 would be Cc Bb. When F1 is crossed with F1, the F2 would be as follows:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So for the C locus, F1 has a 50% chance of being C and 50% of c. Same for the B locus. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nCC BB (25%), CC Bb (25%), CC bb (25%), cc BB (25%), cc Bb (25%), cc bb (25%).\n\nWait, but that's 6 outcomes, but in reality, some phenotypes may be similar due to dominance. So perhaps I should calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the dominant and recessive traits.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Dominant (C) = Checkered red (dominant)\n- Recessive (c) = Plain red (recessive)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Dominant (B) = Brown (dominant)\n- Recessive (b) = Checkered brown (recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes depend on both loci. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain red, Brown\n5. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nNow, let's categorize each into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Plain red, Brown\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red, Brown: Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red, Checkered brown: Cases 2, 3 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain red, Brown: Case 4 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red, Checkered brown: Cases 5, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, that adds up to 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8, but the options provided don't include 8. Wait, but the options suggest a total of 8 in some categories. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me list each possibility:\n\n- Cases where both traits are dominant: CC BB (Checkered red, Brown), CC Bb (Checkered red, Checkered brown), CC bb (Checkered red, Checkered brown) \u2192 3 cases\n- Cases where only one trait is dominant: cc BB (Plain red, Brown), cc Bb (Plain red, Checkered brown), cc bb (Plain red, Checkered brown) \u2192 3 cases\n- Cases where neither trait is dominant: CC BB is already counted as dominant, so perhaps no pure recessive cases. Wait, no\u2014the recessive cases are where both are recessive. CC BB is dominant, so any bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene would have at least one dominant trait. Only the plain red and plain brown would be the recessive ones.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier breakdown, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red, Brown\n2. Checkered red, Checkered brown\n3. Plain red, Brown\n4. Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nAnd each of these occurs 3, 2, 1, and 2 times respectively.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the answer choices are:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of the options match my calculation. Did I miscount?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, looking back, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red, Brown: Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3\n2. Checkered red, Checkered brown: Cases 2, 3 \u2192 2\n3. Plain red, Brown: Case 4 \u2192 1\n4. Plain red, Checkered brown: Cases 5, 6 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8, but the options have totals like 6, 8, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. For example, in some contexts, the order matters, such as whether the C or B trait is considered first. But in the absence of specific instructions, I think the standard approach applies: dominant traits take precedence over recessive ones.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 1+3+9+3=16, which is the total number of F2 individuals (4x4 grid).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including those that didn't arise in the cross described. Wait, but in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F2 would indeed follow the Mendelian ratio.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:1:2, which is 8 total. None of the options match exactly. Let me look again.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nSum: 5+3+2+6=16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I miscalculated the number of each phenotype. Let me redo the counts.\n\nFrom the F2:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red, Brown (1)\n- CC Bb: Checkered red, Checkered brown (1)\n- CC bb: Checkered red, Checkered brown (1)\n- cc BB: Plain red, Brown (1)\n- cc Bb: Plain red, Checkered brown (1)\n- cc bb: Plain red, Checkered brown (1)\n\nWait, that gives 6 cases, but according to the problem statement, each bird is produced by two gametes, so the F2 should have 4 x 4 = 16 birds. Wait, no\u2014each parent produces 4 types of gametes, but in this case, both parents produce the same set of gametes, so the F2 should have 16 birds. Wait, no, the F2 is generated from selfing an individual who has both dominant alleles, so the number of possible phenotypes depends on how many distinct genotypes there are.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the F2 generation. Let me consider the actual F2 generation from the cross described.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u00d7 Parent 2: cc bb.\n\nCross results in F1: Cc Bb.\n\nF1 selfed: F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for each gene, the F2 will have a 50% chance of being dominant (C or B) and 50% recessive (c or b). Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C: CC, Cc, cc\nFor B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nCombining these, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered red, Checkered brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain red, Brown\n5. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nEach of these has a probability of 1/4 (25%). Now, assigning phenotypes based on dominant/recessive:\n\n- 3 cases where both traits are dominant: Checkered red, Brown\n- 2 cases where one trait is dominant and the other is recessive: Checkered red, Checkered brown\n- 1 case where one trait is recessive and the other is dominant: Plain red, Brown\n- 2 cases where both traits are recessive: Plain red, Checkered brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:1:2.\n\nBut none of the options match this. The closest option is Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of each phenotype.

    "rollout": " Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves two birds crossing their genes, and we're supposed to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). The traits involved are color (red or brown) and beak shape (checkered or plain), determined by alleles C/c and B/b respectively.\n\nThe options given are A through J, each providing different phenotypic ratios. I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nLet's start by understanding the genes:\n\n- C and c: C is dominant for checkered, c is recessive for plain.\n- B and b: B is dominant for red, b is recessive for brown.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for each parent are:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB): Both heterozygotes for both genes since they have two dominant alleles for both genes.\n- Parent 2 (cc bb): Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, their offspring will follow the laws of independent assortment. So, each gamete from Parent 1 can carry either C or c for the first gene and either B or b for the second gene. Similarly, each gamete from Parent 2 can only carry c for the first gene and b for the second.\n\nWhen creating the F1 generation, each parent contributes two types of gametes. However, since Parent 1 is heterozygous for both genes, the F1 will be dihybrids, meaning all combinations of Cc and Bb will appear. But wait, actually, no\u2014since each parent is CC BB and cc bb, the F1 should be CcBb because each gamete combines one allele from each parent.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each parent produces gametes that are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, they'll produce gametes where the first gene is C (since both are C) and the second gene is B (both are B). Wait, no\u2014the genotype is CC BB, so all gametes will be C/B. Because both parents contribute one allele each, but since Parent 1 is CC BB, any gamete from them will be C/B.\n\nBut Parent 2 is cc bb, so all its gametes will be c/b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 will receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 on one homolog, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 on the other homolog. So the F1 will be CcBb. But wait, hold on\u2014that might not capture all possibilities correctly.\n\nActually, the F1 should be all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent. Since Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, each gamete from Parent 1 will combine with each gamete from Parent 2. Therefore, the F1 will consist of all possible gamete combinations, resulting in the following genotypes:\n\nFrom Parent 1:\n- C/B\n- C/b\n- c/B\n- c/b\n\nFrom Parent 2:\n- c/b\n\nSo, combining these, each F1 bird will have two sets of gametes\u2014one from each parent. Therefore, the F1 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CcBb (from Parent 1 gamete C/B and Parent 2 gamete c/b)\n- CcBb (same as above, since both are same)\n- CcBb (again same)\n- CcBb (same)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because each F1 bird gets one gamete from each parent. Since Parent 2 only gives c/b, each F1 bird will get either C/B or c/b from Parent 1 and c/b from Parent 2. So the F1 genotypes would be:\n\n- CcBb (from C/B + c/b)\n- c/b c/b \u2192 cc bb (but this won't happen because Parent 1 can't give c/b to itself; actually, each bird has two copies, so maybe I'm mixing up here.)\n\nWait, perhaps better to think about the F1 being the combination of Parent 1's gametes and Parent 2's gametes. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, all its gametes are C/B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so all its gametes are c/b. Therefore, each F1 bird will receive one allele from each parent, making their genotype Cc (from C/B) and Bb (from B/b). So the F1 phenotype is checkered (C) and red (B), hence \"checkered red.\"\n\nWait, but that seems too simplified. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the F1 will be CcBb, but since Parent 1 is CC BB, each gamete from Parent 1 will be C/B, and Parent 2 will give c/b. So each F1 bird will have one copy of C/B and one copy of c/b. Therefore, the F1 will be CcBb. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 should be CcBb for each bird? Or perhaps more accurately, each F1 bird will have one allele from each parent, so for the first gene (C/c), Parent 1 contributes C and Parent 2 contributes c, so the F1 will be Cc. For the second gene (B/b), Parent 1 contributes B and Parent 2 contributes b, so the F1 will be Bb. Therefore, the F1 phenotype is checkered (C) and red (B), so \"checkered red.\"\n\nWait, but then what about the other possibilities? If Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb, then when they mate, each F1 bird will have one allele from each parent. From Parent 1, you could have either C or B, but since Parent 1 is CC BB, both alleles are C and B. So each F1 bird will inherit C from Parent 1 and B from Parent 1, making the first gene checkered, and c from Parent 2 and b from Parent 2, making the second gene brown. Therefore, all F1 birds will be CcBb, so \"checkered red.\"\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So the F1 will all be CcBb, hence \"checkered red.\" Now, moving on to F2.\n\nIn F1, all birds are CcBb. When F1 mates with another F1, the F2 generation will result from a dihybrid cross. The dihybrid cross formula is (CcBb x CcBb). Using the Punnett square method, each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the possible alleles are C/c and B/b.\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n- Parent 1: Cc\n- Parent 2: Cc\n- Possible gametes: C and c\n- Possible offspring genotypes: CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 simplified to CC, Cc, cc.\n\nSimilarly for the second gene (B/b):\n- Parent 1: Bb\n- Parent 2: Bb\n- Possible gametes: B and b\n- Possible offspring genotypes: BB, Bb, bB, bb \u2192 simplified to BB, Bb, bb.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the F2 will have a grid of these possibilities. The phenotypes depend on the combination of both genes.\n\nEach phenotype will be determined by the presence of the dominant alleles C and B. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered and brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain and red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and brown (cccc)\n\nWait, no\u2014let me correct that. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele for C is present (i.e., C_), the bird is checkered.\n- If at least one dominant allele for B is present (i.e., B_), the bird is red.\n- Otherwise, if neither C nor B is present, the bird is plain (for C) and brown (for B).\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. The dominance hierarchy is such that B is dominant over b, and C is dominant over c. So:\n\n- Dominant alleles: C and B.\n- Phenotype depends on whether C and/or B are present.\n\nThus:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is checkered.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is red.\n- If neither C nor B is present (c and b), the bird is plain and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's the opposite. Because if an animal has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it displays the dominant trait. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for checkering (C_), it is checkered.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for red (B_), it is red.\n- If it lacks both dominant alleles, it is plain and brown.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the first gene, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc. For the second gene, BB, Bb, bb.\n\nThe number of each genotype in F2 is calculated based on the Punnett square. For a dihybrid cross, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1, but let's break it down into phenotypes.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, let's consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC_B_: Checkered and red (C_, B_)\n   - Probability: (Probability of C_) * (Probability of B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. CC_bb: Checkered and brown (C_, bb)\n   - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. cc_BB: Plain and red (cc, B_)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. cc_bb: Plain and brown (cc, bb)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these to actual counts:\n\nAssuming 16 individuals:\n\n- 9: Checkered and red\n- 3: Checkered and brown\n- 3: Plain and red\n- 1: Plain and brown\n\nThis matches option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the absolute count. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nHmm, none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, for the dihybrid cross, the probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- Checkered and red (C_, B_): 9/16\n- Checkered and brown (C_, bb): 3/16\n- Plain and red (cc, B_): 3/16\n- Plain and brown (cc, bb): 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided, none of them exactly match this. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,3,1\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nK. 4,4,4,4\n\nL. 3,9,1,3\n\nM. 12,2,2,0\n\nN. 5,3,2,6\n\nO. 7,5,1,3\n\nP. 4,4,4,4\n\nQ. 12,2,2,0\n\nR. 5,3,2,6\n\nS. 7,5,1,3\n\nT. 4,4,4,4\n\nU. 3,9,1,3\n\nV. 12,2,2,0\n\nW. 5,3,2,6\n\nX. 7,5,1,3\n\nY. 4,4,4,4\n\nZ. 12,2,2,0\n\nSo, option K is 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't our case.\n\nOption D is 1,3,3,1, which sums to 8. Our total is 16, so that's half. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let's re-express the dihybrid cross probabilities properly.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits perfectly.\n\nWait, but looking back at the initial problem statement, the options don't include option C as per the user input. Wait, the user input lists options from A to Z, but according to the original instruction, the options were:\n\nA. ... \n\n...\n\nC. ...\n\nD. ...\n\nE. ...\n\nF. ...\n\nG. ...\n\nH. ...\n\nI. ...\n\nJ. ...\n\nK. ?\n\nNo, in the user's message, the last few lines are:\n\nK. 4,4,4,4\n\nL. 3,9,1,3\n\nM. 12,2,2,0\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAh, yes, so option K is 4,4,4,4, which corresponds to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not our case. Option D is 1,3,3,1, which adds up to 8, which is less than 16, so it must correspond to a smaller sample size, like a test cross or a subset. But the question is about F2 generation, which should sum to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the list again:\n\nAfter G, the options continue as:\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1\n\nK. 4,4,4,4\n\nL. 3,9,1,3\n\nM. 12,2,2,0\n\nN. 5,3,2,6\n\nO. 7,5,1,3\n\nP. 4,4,4,4\n\nQ. 12,2,2,0\n\nR. 5,3,2,6\n\nS. 7,5,1,3\n\nT. 4,4,4,4\n\nU. 3,9,1,3\n\nV. 12,2,2,0\n\nW. 5,3,2,6\n\nX. 7,5,1,3\n\nY. 4,4,4,4\n\nZ. 12,2,2,0\n\nSo, option K is 4,4,4,4, which sums to 16, but the ratio is 1:1:1:1, not 9:3:3:1. So that's not matching.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me verify once more.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Presence of C (dominant) \u2192 Checkered.\n- Presence of B (dominant) \u2192 Red.\n- Neither \u2192 Plain and Brown.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered and Brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and Brown (cc_bb)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n1. C_B_: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C_bb: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. cc_B_: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. cc_bb: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nBut in the options provided, option C is written as:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich matches our calculation. So why did I initially think there was a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me confirm the counts:\n\nIf F2 has 16 individuals,\n\n- 9 have C_B_: checkered and red\n- 3 have C_bb: checkered and brown\n- 3 have cc_B_: plain and red\n- 1 has cc_bb: plain and brown\n\nSo, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, corresponding to option C.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, option C is:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nEarlier, I thought option K was 4,4,4,4, which is wrong, but option C is correct.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I thought option D had 1,3,3,1, which would add to 8, but that's incorrect because F2 should sum to 16.\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue arises because in some cases, the F2 generation may involve incomplete dominance or other factors, but in this problem, the traits are codominant, so each gene segregates independently without blending.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves two birds crossing their genes, and we're supposed to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). The traits involved are color (red or brown) and beak shape (checkered or plain), determined by alleles C/c and B/b respectively.\n\nThe options given are A through J, each providing different phenotypic ratios. I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nLet's start by understanding the genes:\n\n- C and c: C is dominant for checkered, c is recessive for plain.\n- B and b: B is dominant for red, b is recessive for brown.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for each parent are:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB): Both heterozygotes for both genes since they have two dominant alleles for both genes.\n- Parent 2 (cc bb): Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, their offspring will follow the laws of independent assortment. So, each gamete from Parent 1 can carry either C or c for the first gene and either B or b for the second gene. Similarly, each gamete from Parent 2 can only carry c for the first gene and b for the second.\n\nWhen creating the F1 generation, each parent contributes two types of gametes. However, since Parent 1 is heterozygous for both genes, the F1 will be dihybrids, meaning all combinations of Cc and Bb will appear. But wait, actually, no\u2014since each parent is CC BB and cc bb, the F1 should be CcBb because each gamete combines one allele from each parent.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each parent produces gametes that are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, they'll produce gametes where the first gene is C (since both are C) and the second gene is B (both are B). Wait, no\u2014the genotype is CC BB, so all gametes will be C/B. Because both parents contribute one allele each, but since Parent 1 is CC BB, any gamete from them will be C/B.\n\nBut Parent 2 is cc bb, so all its gametes will be c/b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 will receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 on one homolog, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 on the other homolog. So the F1 will be CcBb. But wait, hold on\u2014that might not capture all possibilities correctly.\n\nActually, the F1 should be all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent. Since Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, each gamete from Parent 1 will combine with each gamete from Parent 2. Therefore, the F1 will consist of all possible gamete combinations, resulting in the following genotypes:\n\nFrom Parent 1:\n- C/B\n- C/b\n- c/B\n- c/b\n\nFrom Parent 2:\n- c/b\n\nSo, combining these, each F1 bird will have two sets of gametes\u2014one from each parent. Therefore, the F1 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CcBb (from Parent 1 gamete C/B and Parent 2 gamete c/b)\n- CcBb (same as above, since both are same)\n- CcBb (again same)\n- CcBb (same)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because each F1 bird gets one gamete from each parent. Since Parent 2 only gives c/b, each F1 bird will get either C/B or c/b from Parent 1 and c/b from Parent 2. So the F1 genotypes would be:\n\n- CcBb (from C/B + c/b)\n- c/b c/b \u2192 cc bb (but this won't happen because Parent 1 can't give c/b to itself; actually, each bird has two copies, so maybe I'm mixing up here.)\n\nWait, perhaps better to think about the F1 being the combination of Parent 1's gametes and Parent 2's gametes. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, all its gametes are C/B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so all its gametes are c/b. Therefore, each F1 bird will receive one allele from each parent, making their genotype Cc (from C/B) and Bb (from B/b). So the F1 phenotype is checkered (C) and red (B), hence \"checkered red.\"\n\nWait, but that seems too simplified. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the F1 will be CcBb, but since Parent 1 is CC BB, each gamete from Parent 1 will be C/B, and Parent 2 will give c/b. So each F1 bird will have one copy of C/B and one copy of c/b. Therefore, the F1 will be CcBb. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 should be CcBb for each bird? Or perhaps more accurately, each F1 bird will have one allele from each parent, so for the first gene (C/c), Parent 1 contributes C and Parent 2 contributes c, so the F1 will be Cc. For the second gene (B/b), Parent 1 contributes B and Parent 2 contributes b, so the F1 will be Bb. Therefore, the F1 phenotype is checkered (C) and red (B), so \"checkered red.\"\n\nWait, but then what about the other possibilities? If Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb, then when they mate, each F1 bird will have one allele from each parent. From Parent 1, you could have either C or B, but since Parent 1 is CC BB, both alleles are C and B. So each F1 bird will inherit C from Parent 1 and B from Parent 1, making the first gene checkered, and c from Parent 2 and b from Parent 2, making the second gene brown. Therefore, all F1 birds will be CcBb, so \"checkered red.\"\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So the F1 will all be CcBb, hence \"checkered red.\" Now, moving on to F2.\n\nIn F1, all birds are CcBb. When F1 mates with another F1, the F2 generation will result from a dihybrid cross. The dihybrid cross formula is (CcBb x CcBb). Using the Punnett square method, each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the possible alleles are C/c and B/b.\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n- Parent 1: Cc\n- Parent 2: Cc\n- Possible gametes: C and c\n- Possible offspring genotypes: CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 simplified to CC, Cc, cc.\n\nSimilarly for the second gene (B/b):\n- Parent 1: Bb\n- Parent 2: Bb\n- Possible gametes: B and b\n- Possible offspring genotypes: BB, Bb, bB, bb \u2192 simplified to BB, Bb, bb.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the F2 will have a grid of these possibilities. The phenotypes depend on the combination of both genes.\n\nEach phenotype will be determined by the presence of the dominant alleles C and B. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered and brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain and red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and brown (cccc)\n\nWait, no\u2014let me correct that. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele for C is present (i.e., C_), the bird is checkered.\n- If at least one dominant allele for B is present (i.e., B_), the bird is red.\n- Otherwise, if neither C nor B is present, the bird is plain (for C) and brown (for B).\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. The dominance hierarchy is such that B is dominant over b, and C is dominant over c. So:\n\n- Dominant alleles: C and B.\n- Phenotype depends on whether C and/or B are present.\n\nThus:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is checkered.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is red.\n- If neither C nor B is present (c and b), the bird is plain and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's the opposite. Because if an animal has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it displays the dominant trait. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for checkering (C_), it is checkered.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for red (B_), it is red.\n- If it lacks both dominant alleles, it is plain and brown.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the first gene, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc. For the second gene, BB, Bb, bb.\n\nThe number of each genotype in F2 is calculated based on the Punnett square. For a dihybrid cross, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1, but let's break it down into phenotypes.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, let's consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC_B_: Checkered and red (C_, B_)\n   - Probability: (Probability of C_) * (Probability of B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. CC_bb: Checkered and brown (C_, bb)\n   - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. cc_BB: Plain and red (cc, B_)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. cc_bb: Plain and brown (cc, bb)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these to actual counts:\n\nAssuming 16 individuals:\n\n- 9: Checkered and red\n- 3: Checkered and brown\n- 3: Plain and red\n- 1: Plain and brown\n\nThis matches option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the absolute count. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nHmm, none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, for the dihybrid cross, the probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- Checkered and red (C_, B_): 9/16\n- Checkered and brown (C_, bb): 3/16\n- Plain and red (cc, B_): 3/16\n- Plain and brown (cc, bb): 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided, none of them exactly match this.

Let me verify once more.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Presence of C (dominant) \u2192 Checkered.\n- Presence of B (dominant) \u2192 Red.\n- Neither \u2192 Plain and Brown.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered and Brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and Brown (cc_bb)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n1. C_B_: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C_bb: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. cc_B_: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. cc_bb: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nBut in the options provided, option C is written as:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich matches our calculation. So why did I initially think there was a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me confirm the counts:\n\nIf F2 has 16 individuals,\n\n- 9 have C_B_: checkered and red\n- 3 have C_bb: checkered and brown\n- 3 have cc_B_: plain and red\n- 1 has cc_bb: plain and brown\n\nSo, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, corresponding to option C.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, option C is:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nEarlier, I thought option K was 4,4,4,4, which is wrong, but option C is correct.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I thought option D had 1,3,3,1, which would add to 8, but that's incorrect because F2 should sum to 16.\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue arises because in some cases, the F2 generation may involve incomplete dominance or other factors, but in this problem, the traits are codominant, so each gene segregates independently without blending.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

We need to make a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two parents. Then, we have to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. There are multiple options given for the answer, each with different phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let me break down what each gene does. The first locus has genes C and c. C is dominant for checkered color, and c is recessive for plain. So, if someone has at least one C allele, they'll be checkered. If not, they'll be plain.\n\nThe second locus has genes B and b. B is dominant for red color, and b is recessive for brown. So, having at least one B means they're red, and b makes them brown.\n\nNow, looking at the parents:\n\n- Parent 1 is CCBB. That means both alleles are dominant at both loci. So, they will express all dominant traits\u2014checkered and red.\n  \n- Parent 2 is ccbb. Both alleles are recessive. Therefore, they'll express all recessive traits\u2014plain and brown.\n\nSo, when they mate, the possible offspring's genotypes can be determined using a Punnett square. Since each parent contributes one allele from each locus, the combinations will vary based on which alleles are inherited.\n\nLet me outline the possible gametes:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CCBB), since both alleles are dominant, the gametes will be CB (since each allele is present once).\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, for each locus, you get one allele. So, for the first locus (C/c), Parent 1 gives either C or c. But since it's CC, both alleles are C, so all gametes will be C.\n\nFor the second locus (B/b), Parent 1 gives either B or B, because both alleles are B. So, all gametes from Parent 1 will be CB.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (ccbb) can only give cb gametes because all alleles are recessive.\n\nTherefore, the Punnett square would have the following combinations:\n\nParent 1's gametes: CB\nParent 2's gametes: cb\n\nSo, combining them, the F1 generation would be CcBb. Because from Parent 1, we get C and from Parent 2, we get c and b. So, the genotype is CcBb.\n\nWait, but hold on. Actually, the F1 generation is from each parent, so F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1, C + c) and Bb (from Parent 2, B + b). So, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions F2 generation, so maybe I should focus on that after considering F1.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen two parents (each producing gametes) are crossed, the F1 generation consists of all possible combinations. In this case, since Parent 1 is CCBB and Parent 2 is ccbb, their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes C/B (from Parent 1) and c/b (from Parent 2).\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) would self-fertilize to produce F2. So, the next step is to set up the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb. So, in the Punnett square, each parent contributes C or c for the first locus and B or b for the second locus.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square:\n\nFirst Locus (C/c):\n\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\n\nSecond Locus (B/b):\n\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\n\nSo, each F1 contributes C or c, and B or b.\n\nThus, the possible gametes from F1 are:\n\n- C (from Parent 1) + B (from Parent 1) \u2192 CB\n- C (from Parent 1) + b (from Parent 1) \u2192 Cb\n- c (from Parent 2) + B (from Parent 2) \u2192 cB\n- c (from Parent 2) + b (from Parent 2) \u2192 cb\n\nSo, four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nNow, setting up the Punnett square:\n\n```\n          | C   | c   |\n----------|-----|-----|\n        C   | CC  | Cc  |\n----------|-----|-----|\n        c    | cC  | cc  |\n```\n\nWait, no, better to list all combinations properly.\n\nActually, the correct way is to pair each gamete from F1 with each gamete from F1.\n\nSo, the Punnett square cells will contain the genotypes from each combination.\n\nLet me write it correctly:\n\nTop row: Cc (from F1)\nLeft column: Cc (from F1)\n\nSo, each cell is the combination of F1 gamete from top and left.\n\nTop-left cell: C (from F1 gamete) and C (from F1 gamete) \u2192 CC\nTop-middle: C (from F1 gamete) and c (from F1 gamete) \u2192 Cc\nTop-right: c (from F1 gamete) and C (from F1 gamete) \u2192 cC\nBottom-left: c (from F1 gamete) and c (from F1 gamete) \u2192 cc\nMiddle: c (from F1 gamete) and c (from F1 gamete) \u2192 cc\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nEach cell represents the combination of the gametes from both parents contributing to that spot.\n\nSo, the square would look like this:\n\n```\n          | C | c |\n----------|---|---|\n        C | CC | Cc |\n----------|---|---|\n        c | cC | cc |\n```\n\nWait, but gametes from F1 are CB, Cb, cB, cb. So, the F1 individuals contribute these gametes. So, the Punnett square should represent the F1 parents crossing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Each F1 parent produces gametes C/B and c/b. So, the Punnett square combines these gametes.\n\nSo, for the first locus (C/c), the F1s produce C and c. For the second locus (B/b), they produce B and b.\n\nSo, the Punnett square cells will be combinations of C/c and B/b:\n\n```\n          | B | b |\n----------|----|----|\n        C   | CB  | Cb  |\n----------|----|----|\n        c    | cB  | cc  |\n```\n\nWait, but actually, each gamete is a combination of both alleles.

Maybe I should approach it systematically.\n\nEach F1 parent produces four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo, the Punnett square will have these four possibilities for each parent.\n\nSo, the top row and the first column will list these gametes.\n\nThe resulting F2 genotypes will be combinations of gametes from both parents.\n\nSo, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CB (from F1) and CB (from F1): CcBb\n2. CB (from F1) and Cb (from F1): CC Bb \u2192 CcBb? Wait, no.

So, in the F2, the probability of getting C is 50% and c is 50%.\n\nSame for the second locus (B/b): 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the loci are independent, the overall probabilities multiply.\n\nSo, the expected phenotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, the probability of being checkered (C) is 50%, and the probability of being red (B) is 50%. Since the traits are independent, the combined probability is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, meaning 25% checkered red, etc.\n\nAlternatively, without relying on probabilities, we can count the number of each genotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, there are 16 possible combinations, assuming each gamete is equally likely.\n\nBut wait, since each F1 parent is heterozygous for both loci, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, similar to Mendel's laws.\n\nWait, but in reality, each locus is independent, so the phenotypic ratio would be (number of CC) : (number of Cc) : (number of cc) for each locus multiplied together.\n\nSo, for the first locus (C/c):\n\nProbability of CC: 25%\nProbability of Cc: 50%\nProbability of cc: 25%\n\nFor the second locus (B/b):\n\nProbability of BB: 25%\nProbability of Bb: 50%\nProbability of bb: 25%\n\nCombining these, the phenotypic ratio for the two loci is 9:3:3:1.\n\nSo, checking the options provided:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that seems to match the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nSo, option D states the same.\n\nAnother option is H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nThat doesn't fit our ratio.\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., which also doesn't match.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc., which isn't matching.\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., which is higher than our ratio.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we have two birds crossed. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB because they're both homozygous and have the dominant alleles for both color genes. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so that would be cc bb. Since the bird is plain, it has two recessive alleles for each color, meaning both parents are homozygous.\n\nNow, the cross involves an adihybrid, but wait, in this case, the parents are already both homozygous. So maybe the question is about the F1 generation? Wait, no, the question says \"complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, perhaps there was a mistake here. Maybe it's not an adihybrid cross but rather considering another scenario where one bird is heterozygous, like if the parents were different, say CC bb or something else. But as per the given info, both parents are homozygous. That might mean the cross isn't between them but perhaps considering the F1 from a dihybrid cross, but since both parents are homozygous, all offspring will be homozygous.\n\nWait, let me reread the problem statement carefully. It says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Oh, okay, maybe it's referring to a cross where one bird is dihybrids, but the parents themselves are homozygous. Wait, that doesn't make sense because you can't cross a homozygous bird with another bird unless it's also homozygous for some genes. Maybe it's a typo, and they actually meant a dihybrid cross where one bird is AaBb and the other is aaBB or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's about the F1 generation of a dihybrid cross between two homozygous parents. But given the way the question is phrased, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the parents are AA BB and aa bb, leading to F1 as Aa Bb, and then F2 as Aa Bb x Aa Bb.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, particularly choices A through H, the phenotypic ratios seem to vary based on the combination of alleles. Let's clarify:\n\nThe checkered pattern is due to gene C, with C being dominant and c recessive. Piggyback colors are determined by B and b, with B dominant and b recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB\n- Checkered brown: CC bb\n- Plain red: cc BB\n- Plain brown: cc bb\n\nIn the cross described, the parents are homozygous: CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). When you cross these two, all offspring will be CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, resulting in all offspring being Cc Bb. Because when you mate two homozygotes, the F1 will all be the same genotype. Then, in F1, they'll produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but for dihybrid crosses, each parent produces four types of gametes, but since both parents are homozygous, each gamete type is equally likely.\n\nSo the F1 will all be Cc Bb, which translates to:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- Checkered brown: CC bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- Plain brown: cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSince all the F1 are the same, the phenotypic ratio should reflect how many of each phenotype are produced. However, looking at the options, none directly match this scenario because the options involve ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc., suggesting multiple genotypes and thus different phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the cross. Maybe the parents aren't both homozygous. Perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where one parent is AA BB and the other is aa bb. But according to the problem statement, both parents are homozygous. So maybe the correct approach is to consider F1 from a dihybrid cross, assuming that one bird is Aa Bb and the other is aa BB, but that doesn't align with the given parents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are actually different, such as one being AA BB and the other being aa BB, leading to F1 as Aa BB, but again, the problem states both are homozygous.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, and the cross is not F1 but F2. Let me re-examine the problem: it says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\"\n\nAh, so the cross is not F1 but F2. So let's assume that the parents are both homozygous: CC BB and cc bb. Then, F1 would all be Cc Bb, and F2 would result from crossing F1 individuals. But wait, if both parents are homozygous, their offspring would all be Cc Bb, so F1 would all be the same, leading to only one phenotype. However, the options don't suggest that, so perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe I misread the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the parents are a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So when crossed, all F1 would be Cc Bb, which is a single phenotype. Then, F2 would consist of F1 x F1, resulting in all F2 being Cc Bb, so only one phenotype again. This contradicts the options provided, which all show multiple phenotypes.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Perhaps one parent is CC BB and the other is cc Bb, making it a dihybrid cross. In that case, the F1 would be Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb. Then, the F2 would be a dihybrid cross among F1s, leading to various phenotypes.\n\nWait, but the problem specifically mentions the parents as CC BB and cc bb. So perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that both parents are homozygous and thus all offspring are the same, leading to only one phenotype. However, none of the options match this scenario, indicating a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended to refer to a dihybrid cross where one parent is AA BB and the other is aa bb, leading to F1 as Aa Bb, which then produce F2 with varying phenotypes. But since the problem states both parents are homozygous, this seems conflicting.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the parents are indeed homozygous, and thus all F1 are Cc Bb, leading to only one phenotype. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% checkered red (CC BB), 100% checkered brown (CC bb), 100% plain red (cc BB), and 100% plain brown (cc bb). However, the options provided do not include such a scenario, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Perhaps one is AA BB and the other is aa BB, leading to F1 as Aa BB, which then produce F2. But given the problem statement, I think the intended scenario is that both parents are homozygous, leading to a single phenotype in F1 and F2, which conflicts with the answer choices.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should look back at the options and see which makes sense. Option G gives a phenotypic ratio of 12:2:2:0, which sums up to 16, suggesting 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. But why would there be zero plain brown?\n\nWait, perhaps if one bird is CC BB and the other is cc Bb instead of cc bb. Let me recalculate that.\n\nIf one parent is CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and the other is cc Bb (which could be either cc Bb or cc bb depending on dominance), then the F1 would be Cc B, Cc Bb, cc Bb, and cc Bb. Wait, but dominance applies to each gene separately. So if the second parent is cc Bb, then the gametes would be Cc B and cc Bb. Thus, F1 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom CC BB \u00d7 cc Bb:\n- CC \u00d7 cc = Cc\n- CC \u00d7 Bb = Cc B\n- BB \u00d7 cc = Cc\n- BB \u00d7 Bb = Cc B\n\nSo the F1 genotypes would be Cc B, Cc Bb, Cc B, Cc B. But wait, this leads to more complexity. However, this scenario complicates the F2 calculation, and the problem specifies both parents are homozygous, so this may not apply.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Given the problem statement, it's most plausible that both parents are homozygous, leading to F1 as Cc Bb, which results in a single phenotype. However, since none of the answer choices reflect this, perhaps the intended scenario is a dihybrid cross, despite the wording suggesting homozygous parents.\n\nAssuming a dihybrid cross where one parent is AA BB and the other is aa bb, the F1 would be Aa Bb, and the F2 would have a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1. Breaking this down into phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red (AA BB): 9/16\n- Checkered brown (AA bb): 3/16\n- Plain red (aa BB): 3/16\n- Plain brown (aa bb): 1/16\n\nBut the problem states both parents are homozygous, so this doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, implying that in the F2 generation, 12 out of 16 are checkered red, 2 are checkered brown, 2 are plain red, and 0 are plain brown. This might imply that in the cross, one parent is homozygous for a dominant trait, and the other is heterozygous for the other trait, leading to different phenotypic outcomes.\n\nHowever, without further information, I think the best approach is to select option G, as it fits the scenario where the parents are both homozygous, but this seems contradictory. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to present a dihybrid cross despite stating homozygous parents, leading to option G as the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). We need to complete the Punnett square for their offspring, specifically looking at the F2 generation. Then, we have to determine the phenotypic ratio based on the possible genotypes and their probabilities.\n\nFirst, let me break down the genes involved. There are two pairs of genes here: one pair controlling color (B and b) and another controlling beak shape (C and c).\n\nThe parents are:\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 genotype CC BB (since they're both homozygous for each gene)\n- Parent 2: Plain brown \u2192 genotype cc bb (again, homozygous for each gene)\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, we'll get F1 generation, but since we're interested in the F2 generation, which comes from the F1 selfing or between F1 and another type, but actually, the standard approach is that the F1 individuals themselves will produce gametes, and then those gametes will form the F2 population. So, let me think about how the F1 looks.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on\u2014\"adihybrid cross\"\u2014that term isn't familiar to me. Maybe it's a typo? Because adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits, like AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, producing AaAb, etc. But here, the parents are already homozygous for both genes. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake, and they meant dihybrid cross instead of adihybrid. Because if it's a dihybrid cross, then the parents would be AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, resulting in AaAb, AaBb, aaBb, and aabb. But since the parents are homozygous, maybe it's still a dihybrid cross where the F1 is AA BB, Aa BB, Aa Bb, aa BB, Aa bb, etc., but given the parents are homozygous, perhaps the F1 would all be heterozygotes?\n\nWait, no\u2014if you have two homozygous individuals, say, one with CC BB and another with cc bb, their offspring can only be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, etc.\u2014but wait, the F1 would all be heterozygotes because both parents are homozygous. So, the F1 generation would consist of Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, etc.\u2014but more accurately, the F1 would be CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, and ccBB, etc. But actually, when you cross two homozygotes, the F1 generation is all the possible combinations of the alleles from each parent. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, contributing c and b. So, all F1 would be CcBb? Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, meaning both C and B are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, meaning both c and b are recessive. When crossed, each offspring gets one allele from each parent. So, from Parent 1: either C or C (so always C), and either B or B (always B). From Parent 2: either c or c (always c), and either b or b (always b). So, all F1 offspring would be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, etc.? No, wait\u2014it's just Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc bb. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Actually, when you cross CC BB (which is CC BB) with cc bb (which is cc bb), the F1 should be all the possible combinations: Cc, BB; Cc, Bb; Cc, bb; cc, BB; cc, Bb; cc, bb. So the F1 would be CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb. Now, these would be the F1, and then F2 is obtained by selfing or mated again.\n\nBut the question mentions an F2 generation, so after selfing F1. Wait, but the initial question might not specify whether it's selfing or interbreeding. However, typically, for F2, you'd consider the F1 selfed. Alternatively, if F1 were selfed, then the F2 would be the next generation. But regardless, the F2 would come from the F1 individuals.\n\nSo, let's first outline the possible gametes from each parent. The parents are CC BB (from Parent 1) and cc bb (from Parent 2). Each parent will produce four types of gametes:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC BB):\n- Can only give C (dominant for both genes)\n- Can only give B (dominant for both genes)\n\nFrom Parent 2 (cc bb):\n- Can only give c (recessive for both genes)\n- Can only give b (recessive for both genes)\n\nTherefore, all gametes from Parent 1 will be CB, and all gametes from Parent 2 will be cb. Thus, the F1 will receive one allele from each parent, making all F1 birds either CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, or ccBB, etc. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, when you cross CC BB (which is C C B B) with cc bb (c c b b), each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So, for Gene C, Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c. For Gene B, Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b. Therefore, all F1 individuals will be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, cc bb, etc. Wait, no\u2014each F1 individual will have one allele from each parent for each gene. So, for gene C, Parent 1 provides C, Parent 2 provides c. For gene B, Parent 1 provides B, Parent 2 provides b. Therefore, all F1 individuals will be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, cc bb, etc. Wait, but actually, since each parent contributes one allele, all F1 will be Cc for gene C and Bb for gene B, except some may have different combinations. Wait, no\u2014Parent 1 gives C and B, Parent 2 gives c and b. So F1 will have Cc for gene C and Bb for gene B. Similarly, from Parent 2, F1 will have cc for gene C and bb for gene B. Therefore, all F1 will be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, cc bb, etc. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Each F1 receives one allele from each parent for each gene. So, for gene C: Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c. For gene B: Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b. Therefore, each F1 individual has Cc for gene C and Bb for gene B. But also, there's another possibility where Parent 1 gives c for gene C and Parent 2 gives C for gene C, resulting in cc for gene C. Similarly, for gene B, Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b, leading to Bb for gene B, or Parent 1 gives b and Parent 2 gives B, leading to Bb as well. Wait, but actually, since Parent 1 is CC BB, it can only give C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, giving c and b. Therefore, all F1 individuals will have Cc for gene C (from Parent 1) and Bb for gene B (from Parent 2). But wait, that can't be right because Parent 1 can only give C and B, and Parent 2 can only give c and b. So, for gene C, F1 will have C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2013 thus, Cc. For gene B, F1 will have B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2013 thus, Bb. Therefore, all F1 individuals will be Cc Bb. That makes sense because Parent 1 is homozygous for both dominant traits, and Parent 2 is homozygous for both recessive. So, when crossed, all offspring will inherit one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene, resulting in Cc Bb.\n\nWait, that seems odd because sometimes the parents aren't both homozygous for both traits. Wait, but in this case, Parent 1 is CC BB, which means both genes are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, which means both genes are recessive. So, when crossed, the F1 will be Cc Bb. But then, why do we even go into F2? Or perhaps I've misunderstood something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to an adihybrid cross, which involves two different traits, but in this case, both parents are homozygous for both traits. So, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the parents are actually AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, making a dihybrid cross. If that's the case, then the F1 would be AaBb, and the F2 would follow Mendelian ratios. But since the question states the parents are homozygous, perhaps the intended setup is that one parent is AaBb and the other is AaBb, leading to a dihybrid cross.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the question refers to a dihybrid cross between two AaBb parents, resulting in AaAb, AaBb, aaBb, and aabb genotypes, with respective phenotypes determined by dominance.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't seem to fit a dihybrid cross scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the initial explanation was correct, and the parents are indeed homozygous for both genes, resulting in all F1 being Cc Bb. But that wouldn't lead to any variation in the F2, which contradicts the presence of different phenotypes in the options. Therefore, I must conclude that there's a misunderstanding in the way the parents are set up.\n\nPerhaps the parents are actually AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, making a dihybrid cross, but the user made a typo, thinking it's a dihybrid cross when it's actually a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, maybe the initial description is incorrect, and the parents are indeed both homozygous, leading to all F1 being Cc Bb.\n\nIn any case, proceeding with the assumption that the parents are AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, let's construct the Punnett square.\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n- A (dominant for A)\n- a (recessive for A)\n- B (dominant for B)\n- b (recessive for B)\n\nThe F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations, leading to nine possible genotypes:\n- AAB_B_ (AA BB)\n- AAB_b (AA Bb)\n- AaB_B (Aa BB)\n- AaB_b (Aa Bb)\n- aaB_B (aa BB)\n- aaB_b (aa Bb)\n- AAB_B (AA BB) [duplicate]\n- AAB_b (AA Bb) [duplicate]\n- AaB_b (Aa Bb) [duplicate]\n\nBut considering the actual combinations, it's better to list them as:\n\n1. AAB_ (AABB, AABb, AA_bb, etc.)\nWait, no. Let me properly write the Punnett square for a dihybrid cross between AaBb \u00d7 AaBb.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. So, for gene A, each parent can give A or a, and for gene B, each parent can give B or b. The possible combinations for each gene are independent.\n\nSo, the F1 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor gene A: AA, Aa, aa\nFor gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThus, the F1 genotypes will be combinations of these, leading to nine possible genotypes:\n1. AA BB\n2. AA Bb\n3. AA bb\n4. Aa BB\n5. Aa Bb\n6. Aa bb\n7. aa BB\n8. aa Bb\n9. aa bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on dominance. Assume that for gene A, A is dominant over a, and for gene B, B is dominant over b.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n- For each genotype, if both dominant alleles are present, the phenotype is dominant.\n- So, for example, AA BB \u2192 dominant A and dominant B \u2192 dominant phenotype.\nSimilarly, Aa BB \u2192 dominant A and dominant B \u2192 dominant.\nAa Bb \u2192 dominant A and dominant B \u2192 dominant.\nAA Bb \u2192 same.\nAa bb \u2192 dominant A and recessive B \u2192 intermediate.\naa BB \u2192 recessive a and dominant B \u2192 intermediate.\naa Bb \u2192 recessive a and recessive B \u2192 recessive.\naa bb \u2192 recessive a and recessive B \u2192 recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014phenotypes depend on both genes. So, for example, if an animal has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will express the dominant trait(s). Otherwise, it won't.\n\nAssuming that the dominant traits are expressed when at least one dominant allele is present for each gene. Wait, but typically, the expression depends on both genes. For instance, if an animal has a dominant A and a dominant B, it expresses both dominant traits. But without specific information on how the traits interact, it's safer to assume that having at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the dominant phenotype.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be categorized as:\n- Dominant (e.g., A_B_)\n- Recessive (e.g., a_bb)\n\nSo, the F1 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes would be:\n\n1. AA BB \u2192 Dominant A and Dominant B \u2192 Dominant Phenotype\n2. AA Bb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Dominant\n3. AA bb \u2192 Dominant A and Recessive B \u2192 Intermediate?\nWait, no\u2014wait, if B is dominant, then having at least one B allele would result in the dominant phenotype for B. But since B is dominant, any presence of B would mean the animal is dominant for B. Similarly for A.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the dominant status is per gene. So, for each gene, if the organism has at least one dominant allele, it expresses that trait. So, for gene A, presence of A leads to dominant phenotype, and for gene B, presence of B leads to dominant phenotype.\n\nThus, the phenotype is a combination of both traits. If the animal has at least one dominant allele for A and at least one dominant allele for B, it exhibits both dominant traits. If it has at least one dominant allele for A but none for B, it expresses the A dominant trait. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for B but none for A, it expresses the B dominant trait. Only if it has no dominant alleles for either gene does it express the recessive phenotype.\n\nSo, applying that to our F1 genotypes:\n\n1.

If it has at least one A but none B, it shows the A dominant trait. If it has at least one B but none A, it shows the B dominant trait. If neither A nor B is present (all recessive), it shows the recessive trait.\n\nApplying that:\n\nPhenotype classification:\n1. Dominant (A_B_)\n2. Dominant (A_bb)\n3. Dominant (AA bb)\n4. Dominant (Aa BB)\n5. Dominant (Aa Bb)\n6. Dominant (Aa bb)\n7. Dominant (aa_B_)\n8. Dominant (aa Bb)\n9. Recessive (aaa?)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, for gene B, if the organism has at least one B allele, it shows the dominant trait.

Similarly, if it has at least one A allele, it will show the dominant A trait regardless of B. Therefore, only animals that have no A and no B alleles will have the recessive phenotype.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nWe have two birds crossed in an adhybrid cross. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). We need to complete the Punnett square for their offspring, specifically looking at the F2 generation. Then, we have to determine the phenotypic ratio based on the possible genotypes and their probabilities.\n\nFirst, let me break down the genes involved. There are two pairs of genes here: one pair controlling color (B and b) and another controlling beak shape (C and c).\n\nThe parents are:\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 genotype CC BB (since they're both homozygous for each gene)\n- Parent 2: Plain brown \u2192 genotype cc bb (again, homozygous for each gene)\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, we'll get F1 generation, but since we're interested in the F2 generation, which comes from the F1 selfing or between F1 and another type, but actually, the standard approach is that the F1 individuals themselves will produce gametes, and then those gametes will form the F2 population. So, let me think about how the F1 looks.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on\u2014\"adihybrid cross\"\u2014that term isn't familiar to me. Maybe it's a typo? Because adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits, like AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, producing AaAb, etc. But here, the parents are already homozygous for both genes. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake, and they meant dihybrid cross instead of adihybrid. Because if it's a dihybrid cross, then the parents would be AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, resulting in AaAb, AaBb, aaBb, and aabb. But since the parents are homozygous, maybe it's still a dihybrid cross where the F1 is AA BB, Aa BB, Aa Bb, aa BB, Aa bb, etc., but given the parents are homozygous, perhaps the F1 would all be heterozygotes?\n\nWait, no\u2014if you have two homozygous individuals, say, one with CC BB and another with cc bb, their offspring can only be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, etc.\u2014but wait, the F1 would all be heterozygotes because both parents are homozygous. So, the F1 generation would consist of Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, etc.\u2014but more accurately, the F1 would be CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, and ccBB, etc. But actually, when you cross two homozygotes, the F1 generation is all the possible combinations of the alleles from each parent. Since Parent 1 is CC BB, it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, contributing c and b. So, all F1 would be CcBb? Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, meaning both C and B are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, meaning both c and b are recessive. When crossed, each offspring gets one allele from each parent. So, from Parent 1: either C or C (so always C), and either B or B (always B). From Parent 2: either c or c (always c), and either b or b (always b). So, all F1 offspring would be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, etc.? No, wait\u2014it's just Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc bb. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Actually, when you cross CC BB (which is CC BB) with cc bb (which is cc bb), the F1 should be all the possible combinations: Cc, BB; Cc, Bb; Cc, bb; cc, BB; cc, Bb; cc, bb. So the F1 would be CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb. Now, these would be the F1, and then F2 is obtained by selfing or mated again.\n\nBut the question mentions an F2 generation, so after selfing F1. Wait, but the initial question might not specify whether it's selfing or interbreeding. However, typically, for F2, you'd consider the F1 selfed. Alternatively, if F1 were selfed, then the F2 would be the next generation. But regardless, the F2 would come from the F1 individuals.\n\nSo, let's first outline the possible gametes from each parent. The parents are CC BB (from Parent 1) and cc bb (from Parent 2). Each parent will produce four types of gametes:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC BB):\n- Can only give C (dominant for both genes)\n- Can only give B (dominant for both genes)\n\nFrom Parent 2 (cc bb):\n- Can only give c (recessive for both genes)\n- Can only give b (recessive for both genes)\n\nTherefore, all gametes from Parent 1 will be CB, and all gametes from Parent 2 will be cb. Thus, the F1 will receive one allele from each parent, making all F1 birds either CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, or ccBB, etc. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, when you cross CC BB (which is C C B B) with cc bb (c c b b), each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So, for Gene C, Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c. For Gene B, Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b. Therefore, all F1 individuals will be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, cc bb, etc. Wait, no\u2014each F1 individual will have one allele from each parent for each gene. So, for gene C, Parent 1 provides C, Parent 2 provides c. For gene B, Parent 1 provides B, Parent 2 provides b. Therefore, all F1 individuals will be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, cc bb, etc. Wait, but actually, since each parent contributes one allele, all F1 will be Cc for gene C and Bb for gene B, except some may have different combinations. Wait, no\u2014Parent 1 gives C and B, Parent 2 gives c and b. So F1 will have Cc for gene C and Bb for gene B. Similarly, from Parent 2, F1 will have cc for gene C and bb for gene B. Therefore, all F1 will be Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc BB, Cc Bb, cc bb, etc. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Each F1 receives one allele from each parent for each gene. So, for gene C: Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c. For gene B: Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b. Therefore, each F1 individual has Cc for gene C and Bb for gene B. But also, there's another possibility where Parent 1 gives c for gene C and Parent 2 gives C for gene C, resulting in cc for gene C. Similarly, for gene B, Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b, leading to Bb for gene B, or Parent 1 gives b and Parent 2 gives B, leading to Bb as well. Wait, but actually, since Parent 1 is CC BB, it can only give C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, giving c and b. Therefore, all F1 individuals will have Cc for gene C (from Parent 1) and Bb for gene B (from Parent 2). But wait, that can't be right because Parent 1 can only give C and B, and Parent 2 can only give c and b. So, for gene C, F1 will have C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2013 thus, Cc. For gene B, F1 will have B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2013 thus, Bb. Therefore, all F1 individuals will be Cc Bb. That makes sense because Parent 1 is homozygous for both dominant traits, and Parent 2 is homozygous for both recessive. So, when crossed, all offspring will inherit one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene, resulting in Cc Bb.\n\nWait, that seems odd because sometimes the parents aren't both homozygous for both traits. Wait, but in this case, Parent 1 is CC BB, which means both genes are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, which means both genes are recessive. So, when crossed, the F1 will be Cc Bb. But then, why do we even go into F2? Or perhaps I've misunderstood something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question refers to an adihybrid cross, which involves two different traits, but in this case, both parents are homozygous for both traits. So, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the parents are actually AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, making a dihybrid cross. If that's the case, then the F1 would be AaBb, and the F2 would follow Mendelian ratios. But since the question states the parents are homozygous, perhaps the intended setup is that one parent is AaBb and the other is AaBb, leading to a dihybrid cross.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the question refers to a dihybrid cross between two AaBb parents, resulting in AaAb, AaBb, aaBb, and aabb genotypes, with respective phenotypes determined by dominance.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't seem to fit a dihybrid cross scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the initial explanation was correct, and the parents are indeed homozygous for both genes, resulting in all F1 being Cc Bb. But that wouldn't lead to any variation in the F2, which contradicts the presence of different phenotypes in the options. Therefore, I must conclude that there's a misunderstanding in the way the parents are set up.\n\nPerhaps the parents are actually AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, making a dihybrid cross, but the user made a typo, thinking it's a dihybrid cross when it's actually a dihybrid cross.

AA BB \u2192 Dominant A and Dominant B \u2192 Dominant Phenotype\n2. AA Bb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Dominant\n3.

Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for B but none for A, it expresses the B dominant trait. Only if it has no dominant alleles for either gene does it express the recessive phenotype.\n\nSo, applying that to our F1 genotypes:\n\n1.

So that means if someone has at least one C allele, they have the checkered pattern. If both alleles are c, then it's plain. Got it.\n\nThen, there's the coloring part. Red is controlled by gene B, which is dominant, meaning at least one B allele gives them red. If both are b, they're brown. Makes sense.\n\nThe cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So the first parent must be BBCC because they're red (B is dominant, so having BB or BC would give red). Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, for the color Pigmentation, since B is dominant, any presence of B in the genotype results in red pigment. So the parent with red must be BB or Bb. But since it's a homozygous bird, it's BB. Because if it were Bb, it wouldn't be homozygous. Wait, but the question says \"homozygous checkered red bird.\" Checkered is due to the C gene, right? So perhaps the bird is BBCC because it's homozygous for the red pigment but not necessarily for the checkered pattern. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial description said the checkered pattern is controlled by C. So the C gene determines the checkered pattern, while the c is plain. Then, red color is B, and brown is b. So each bird has two alleles for each trait: one for checkered (C or c) and one for color (B or b).\n\nSo the parent with checkered red must be CC_B_, because they're homozygous red (so BB for color), and their C\u57fa\u56e0 determines the checkered pattern. So their genotype is CC_B_. But wait, since it's homozygous, they must be either CC or BB for the other trait. Wait, no\u2014the wording was about the pigmentation being control by B. The checkered is from C. So the bird is homozygous for red (so BB) and heterozygous for the checkered pattern? Or is it homozygous for both traits?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird.\" That suggests that the bird is homozygous for both traits. Because \"checkered\" is determined by C, and \"red\" is determined by B. So if the bird is homozygous for both, then it's CC_B_. Because CC would make it checkered regardless of B, and B_ would make it red. So yes, that makes sense. So the genotype is CC_B_.\n\nThe other parent is a plain brown bird, which is ccbb. Because it's plain (no c) and brown (no b). So their genotype is ccbb.\n\nNow, we need to do an F1 generation. Wait, but the question is asking about an F2 generation. Oh, okay. So after F1, we cross F1s to get F2. But wait, the problem says \"gametes: CB, cb, etc.\" Maybe I should construct the Punnett square based on these gametes.\n\nBut wait, the user provided some information about possible F1 and F2 genotypes. Let me look at what they wrote.\n\nThey started with:\n\n- Gametes: CB, cb.\n- F1: CcBb.\n- Then another set of gametes:\n  - CB, cb.\n- F1\u00d7F1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n- They list all possible combinations as (CB)(CB), (CB)(cb), etc., which seems like all possible F1 x F1 combinations.\n\nBut the main point is to find the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the options given are A to H, each with different phenotypic ratios. So I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the possible offspring genotypes when F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb).\n2. From those genotypes, determine the phenotypes based on the dominance hierarchy.\n3. Calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation using Mendel's laws.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the F1 genotype. Since it's CcBb crossed with CcBb, each parent will produce four types of gametes:\n\nGametes from CcBb: \n- C_B_ (probability 25%),\n- C_bb (25%),\n- cc_B_ (25%),\n- cc_bb (25%).\n\nWhen crossing, each gamete from one parent combines with each gamete from the other parent.\n\nSo the F2 generation will consist of 16 possible combinations. However, many will be the same, so we can calculate the probabilities.\n\nEach trait is independently assorting, so the probability for each combination is (1/4)^2 = 1/16.\n\nNow, let's map the phenotypes based on dominance:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- Dominant (C): Checkered pattern.\n- Recessive (c): Plain pattern.\n\nFor the B gene:\n- Dominant (B): Red color.\n- Recessive (b): Brown color.\n\nSince the traits are independent, we can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that each gene segregates independently.\n\nTo simplify, let's break down each gene's contribution:\n\n- C gene: C (dominant) or c (recessive)\n- B gene: B (dominant) or b (recessive)\n\nThe phenotypes depend on both genes, so each combination of dominant or recessive alleles will result in a specific phenotype.\n\nLet's create a table of all possible combinations, assigning the phenotypes based on the dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but since it's an F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb), the typical F2 phenotypic ratio without considering dominance is 9:3:1:1:2:2:2:2:..., but with dominance, it changes.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, when both traits are independently assorting and dominant, the F2 phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1 for each trait, but combined. Alternatively, let's compute it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each trait, so:\n\nFor C (pattern):\n\n- C_: Checkered\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor B (color):\n\n- B_: Red\n- bb: Brown\n\nThe phenotype depends on both traits. So each bird has a combination of these.\n\nThe order of dominance is important. Since C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, but the interaction isn't specified beyond that. However, typically, when both traits are under independent dominance, the phenotypic ratio follows 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nWait, but in this case, since both traits are expressed independently, the overall phenotypic ratio would be (9 + 3 + 3 + 1) : ... Wait, perhaps better to count each possible combination.\n\nWait, let's model it:\n\nEach bird has four alleles: two for pattern (C/c) and two for color (B/b).\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. Pattern: C_, Color: B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Pattern: C_, Color: bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. Pattern: cc, Color: B_ \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Pattern: cc, Color: bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the four phenotypes are Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown.\n\nNow, the task is to find how many birds fall into each category.\n\nSince each gene segregates independently, the total number of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities:\n\nPattern:\n\nProbability of C_: 3/4\nProbability of cc: 1/4\n\nColor:\n\nProbability of B_: 3/4\nProbability of bb: 1/4\n\nAssuming independence, the joint probabilities are:\n\nCheckered Red: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nCheckered Brown: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain Red: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain Brown: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct.\n\nSo now, according to these probabilities:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/16\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Red: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6/2/6/2 sum to 16? No, 6+2+6+2=16, so ratio 6:2:6:2. Doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratios 8:4:0:4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nAlright, there's this checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C. So that means if someone has at least one C allele, they have the checkered pattern. If both alleles are c, then it's plain. Got it.\n\nThen, there's the coloring part. Red is controlled by gene B, which is dominant, meaning at least one B allele gives them red. If both are b, they're brown. Makes sense.\n\nThe cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So the first parent must be BBCC because they're red (B is dominant, so having BB or BC would give red). Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, for the color Pigmentation, since B is dominant, any presence of B in the genotype results in red pigment. So the parent with red must be BB or Bb. But since it's a homozygous bird, it's BB. Because if it were Bb, it wouldn't be homozygous. Wait, but the question says \"homozygous checkered red bird.\" Checkered is due to the C gene, right? So perhaps the bird is BBCC because it's homozygous for the red pigment but not necessarily for the checkered pattern. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial description said the checkered pattern is controlled by C. So the C gene determines the checkered pattern, while the c is plain. Then, red color is B, and brown is b. So each bird has two alleles for each trait: one for checkered (C or c) and one for color (B or b).\n\nSo the parent with checkered red must be CC_B_, because they're homozygous red (so BB for color), and their C\u57fa\u56e0 determines the checkered pattern. So their genotype is CC_B_. But wait, since it's homozygous, they must be either CC or BB for the other trait. Wait, no\u2014the wording was about the pigmentation being control by B. The checkered is from C. So the bird is homozygous for red (so BB) and heterozygous for the checkered pattern? Or is it homozygous for both traits?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird.\" That suggests that the bird is homozygous for both traits. Because \"checkered\" is determined by C, and \"red\" is determined by B. So if the bird is homozygous for both, then it's CC_B_. Because CC would make it checkered regardless of B, and B_ would make it red. So yes, that makes sense. So the genotype is CC_B_.\n\nThe other parent is a plain brown bird, which is ccbb. Because it's plain (no c) and brown (no b). So their genotype is ccbb.\n\nNow, we need to do an F1 generation. Wait, but the question is asking about an F2 generation. Oh, okay. So after F1, we cross F1s to get F2. But wait, the problem says \"gametes: CB, cb, etc.\" Maybe I should construct the Punnett square based on these gametes.\n\nBut wait, the user provided some information about possible F1 and F2 genotypes. Let me look at what they wrote.\n\nThey started with:\n\n- Gametes: CB, cb.\n- F1: CcBb.\n- Then another set of gametes:\n  - CB, cb.\n- F1\u00d7F1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n- They list all possible combinations as (CB)(CB), (CB)(cb), etc., which seems like all possible F1 x F1 combinations.\n\nBut the main point is to find the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the options given are A to H, each with different phenotypic ratios. So I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the possible offspring genotypes when F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb).\n2. From those genotypes, determine the phenotypes based on the dominance hierarchy.\n3. Calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation using Mendel's laws.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the F1 genotype. Since it's CcBb crossed with CcBb, each parent will produce four types of gametes:\n\nGametes from CcBb: \n- C_B_ (probability 25%),\n- C_bb (25%),\n- cc_B_ (25%),\n- cc_bb (25%).\n\nWhen crossing, each gamete from one parent combines with each gamete from the other parent.\n\nSo the F2 generation will consist of 16 possible combinations. However, many will be the same, so we can calculate the probabilities.\n\nEach trait is independently assorting, so the probability for each combination is (1/4)^2 = 1/16.\n\nNow, let's map the phenotypes based on dominance:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- Dominant (C): Checkered pattern.\n- Recessive (c): Plain pattern.\n\nFor the B gene:\n- Dominant (B): Red color.\n- Recessive (b): Brown color.\n\nSince the traits are independent, we can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that each gene segregates independently.\n\nTo simplify, let's break down each gene's contribution:\n\n- C gene: C (dominant) or c (recessive)\n- B gene: B (dominant) or b (recessive)\n\nThe phenotypes depend on both genes, so each combination of dominant or recessive alleles will result in a specific phenotype.\n\nLet's create a table of all possible combinations, assigning the phenotypes based on the dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but since it's an F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb), the typical F2 phenotypic ratio without considering dominance is 9:3:1:1:2:2:2:2:..., but with dominance, it changes.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, when both traits are independently assorting and dominant, the F2 phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1 for each trait, but combined. Alternatively, let's compute it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each trait, so:\n\nFor C (pattern):\n\n- C_: Checkered\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor B (color):\n\n- B_: Red\n- bb: Brown\n\nThe phenotype depends on both traits.

However, typically, when both traits are under independent dominance, the phenotypic ratio follows 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nWait, but in this case, since both traits are expressed independently, the overall phenotypic ratio would be (9 + 3 + 3 + 1) : ... Wait, perhaps better to count each possible combination.\n\nWait, let's model it:\n\nEach bird has four alleles: two for pattern (C/c) and two for color (B/b).\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. Pattern: C_, Color: B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Pattern: C_, Color: bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. Pattern: cc, Color: B_ \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Pattern: cc, Color: bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the four phenotypes are Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown.\n\nNow, the task is to find how many birds fall into each category.\n\nSince each gene segregates independently, the total number of each phenotype can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities:\n\nPattern:\n\nProbability of C_: 3/4\nProbability of cc: 1/4\n\nColor:\n\nProbability of B_: 3/4\nProbability of bb: 1/4\n\nAssuming independence, the joint probabilities are:\n\nCheckered Red: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nCheckered Brown: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain Red: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain Brown: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, that adds up to 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct.\n\nSo now, according to these probabilities:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/16\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Red: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them match exactly.

    "rollout": " Let's see what it's about. There are these birds with different colored beaks and their alleles controlling those colors. The main goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation after a specific cross.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is from the recessive allele c.\n- Red color is governed by a dominant gene B.\n- Brown is due to the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for both C and B. The combination determines their phenotype.\n\nThe parents involved in the cross are:\n- A homozygous checkered red bird: That should be CC BB since checkered is dominant (C), and red is dominant (B). Homozygous means both alleles are the same, so CC BB.\n- A plain brown bird: This would be cc bb because plain is recessive (c), and brown is recessive (b).\n\nWait, but wait\u2014plain color is from the recessive allele, so if the bird is plain, both alleles must be recessive. So yes, cc is plain, and bb is brown. Therefore, the parent is cc bb.\n\nNow, we're looking at an F1 generation before the F2 cross. But actually, the question mentions that the F1 generation isn't needed here\u2014it's asking about the F2 generation after crossing F1s together? Or maybe not. Wait, no\u2014the question says to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 generation might not even exist here; instead, we need to look at the F2.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial setup. Because typically, you'd have parents producing F1, then F1 producing F2. Here, the parents are already F1s, and they produce gametes. Then F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct as presented, meaning the parents themselves are F1, and we're considering their cross to get F2. Hmm, that seems odd because F1 generation wouldn't make sense unless the parents were F1. Maybe there's confusion in the question's phrasing.\n\nLet me proceed under the assumption that the question is correctly stated: creating a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Adihybrid refers to a dihybrid cross, which involves two traits. So, the parents are each heterozygous for both genes (C_B_b), making them dihybrids. Their offspring will have various combinations.\n\nWait, but in this case, one parent is homozygous for both genes (CC BB), and the other is homozygous for both (cc bb). So when crossed, all offspring will be Cc Bb, making F1 all Cc Bb. Then F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. So let's focus on that.\n\nEach bird has two pairs of alleles: one for C and one for B. The possible alleles for each gene are uppercase (dominant) or lowercase (recessive).\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parental: CC and cc \u2192 F1: Cc\n- F1: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 F2: CC, Cc, cc\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- Parental: BB and bb \u2192 F1: Bb\n- F1: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 F2: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSince the loci are independent, we can consider them separately. Each gene contributes independently to the phenotype.\n\nSo, the total phenotypic classes depend on the combination of the two genes. Each bird has four possible genotype combinations for the two genes (since each gene is diploid, but we're looking at the combined effect). However, phenotypically, the combination of dominant and recessive alleles will determine the color.\n\nWait, but the question also gives us the mapping: checkered is Cc, plain is cc. Similarly, red is BB, brown is bb. So, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combinations of the two genes:\n\n- Checkered red: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Cc \u00d7 BB = CcBB\n- Checkered brown: Cc \u00d7 bb = Ccbb\n- Plain red: cc \u00d7 BB = ccBB\n- Plain brown: cc \u00d7 bb = ccbb\n\nSo, four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, each gene is independently segregating. For each gene, the probability of each genotype is as follows:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBB (Checkered Red)\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB (Plain Red)\n4. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB (Checkered Red)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, each allele from the first parent (CC BB) combines with each allele from the second parent (cc bb).\n\nSo, for Gene C:\n- From CC, it's always C.\n- From cc, it's always c.\n\nFor Gene B:\n- From BB, it's always B.\n- From bb, it's always b.\n\nThus, the F2 genotype is always Cc Bb. So, the phenotype depends solely on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the F2 generation is being considered, so each bird's phenotype is based on both C and B.\n\nSo, let's think about how many birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Dominant (C): 50% (Cc)\n- Recessive (c): 50% (cc)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Dominant (B): 50% (Bb)\n- Recessive (b): 50% (bb)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered Red: C dominant and B dominant \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Checkered Brown: C dominant and B recessive \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Red: C recessive and B dominant \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Brown: C recessive and B recessive \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but the question options don\u2019t seem to match this. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, the actual calculation is:\n\nEach trait is independent, so the number of birds in each phenotype is 25%. But the options provided don\u2019t include 25% for any phenotype. Instead, the options suggest more than 25% for some phenotypes.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the phenotypes are based on the entire genotype. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Checkered pattern is C\n- Plain color is c\n- Red color is B\n- Brown is b\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nTherefore, each bird has two alleles for C and two for B. The phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant and recessive alleles in both genes.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"checkered pattern\" as controlled by C, so perhaps the dominance is per allele, but the overall phenotype depends on whether the allele is present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is determined by the presence of either dominant C or dominant B, but that doesn't align with the initial description.\n\nWait, the initial description says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Red color is control by dominant gene B.\n- Brown color by recessive allele b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. The presence of dominant alleles for either gene results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nWait, but the checkered pattern is determined by C. So, perhaps the checkered pattern is expressed when at least one dominant allele exists (either C or B), leading to a checkered appearance. While the color is determined by the other gene.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it methodically.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Checkered pattern: dominant C (C)\n- Plain: recessive c (cc)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Checkered: dominant B (B)\n- Plain: recessive b (bb)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both genes. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Red (C B)\n2. C dominant and B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown (C b)\n3. C recessive and B dominant \u2192 Plain Red (c B)\n4. C recessive and B recessive \u2192 Plain Brown (c b)\n\nNow, in the F2 generation, each gene is independently segregating. So, for each gene, the probability is 25% for each possible genotype.\n\nHowever, the question is about the phenotypic ratio, so we need to count how many birds fall into each phenotype class.\n\nEach bird is a combination of the two genes. Since the loci are independent, the number of birds in each phenotype is equal to the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Checkered Red (C dominant and B dominant): 50% (for C) \u00d7 50% (for B) = 25%\n- Checkered Brown (C dominant and B recessive): 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Red (c dominant and B dominant): 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Brown (c dominant and B recessive): 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n\nAdding these up gives 100%.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect 25% for each phenotype. Instead, the options suggest different ratios like 6,2, etc. So, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the initial description: the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color by B. So, each bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nWait, but perhaps the checkered pattern is when at least one dominant allele is present for either gene. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either C or B, it's checkered. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSo, the checkered phenotype includes all birds except those with both alleles recessive for both genes. So, the checkered phenotype covers three cases:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele in C or B.\n\nWhich would exclude only the cc bb (both recessive for both genes) bird.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered (all other birds)\n2. Plain (only cc bb)\n\nBut the problem statement says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B\n- Brown color by recessive allele b\n\nSo, the checkered pattern is when C is present (at least one dominant allele for C), and plain color is when c is present (both recessive for C). Similarly, red is when B is present, brown when b is present.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions checkered pattern, which is from C. So, perhaps the presence of dominant C makes the pattern checkered, while the color is determined by B. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of dominant B affects the color, but the pattern is determined by C.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps the checkered pattern is caused by the presence of dominant C alleles, regardless of B. So, if a bird has at least one dominant C, it shows a checkered pattern. The color is determined by B: if B is dominant, it's red; else, brown.\n\nIn this case, the phenotype depends on both C and B.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Red (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Checkered and Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and Red (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain and Brown (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nFor each gene, the probability is 50% for dominant (C or B) and 50% recessive.\n\nSince the genes are independent:\n\n- Probability of C dominant and B dominant: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- C dominant and B recessive: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- c dominant and B dominant: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- c dominant and B recessive: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nAgain, adding to 100%.\n\nBut the answer options don't reflect this. They all have numbers greater than 25% for some phenotypes. Perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the checkered pattern is determined by both dominant C and dominant B alleles, whereas the color is determined by one of them. Or perhaps the checkered pattern is when at least one dominant allele is present in C, and the color is determined by B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the checkered pattern is when at least one dominant allele is present in either gene, and the color is determined by the presence of dominant B.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered pattern is when at least one dominant allele is present for C, but the color is determined by B. So, the presence of dominant B changes the color, while the presence of dominant C creates the checkered pattern.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered (C dominant, B any)\n2. Plain (c dominant, B any)\n\nBecause the color depends on B. If B is dominant, it's red; else, brown. The pattern is determined by C: if C is dominant, it's checkered; else, plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Red (C dominant and B dominant)\n- Checkered Brown (C dominant and B recessive)\n- Plain Red (c dominant and B dominant)\n- Plain Brown (c dominant and B recessive)\n\nSame as before, with each having 25% chance.\n\nBut again, the answer options don't match this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's see what it's about. There are these birds with different colored beaks and their alleles controlling those colors. The main goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation after a specific cross.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is from the recessive allele c.\n- Red color is governed by a dominant gene B.\n- Brown is due to the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for both C and B. The combination determines their phenotype.\n\nThe parents involved in the cross are:\n- A homozygous checkered red bird: That should be CC BB since checkered is dominant (C), and red is dominant (B). Homozygous means both alleles are the same, so CC BB.\n- A plain brown bird: This would be cc bb because plain is recessive (c), and brown is recessive (b).\n\nWait, but wait\u2014plain color is from the recessive allele, so if the bird is plain, both alleles must be recessive. So yes, cc is plain, and bb is brown. Therefore, the parent is cc bb.\n\nNow, we're looking at an F1 generation before the F2 cross. But actually, the question mentions that the F1 generation isn't needed here\u2014it's asking about the F2 generation after crossing F1s together? Or maybe not. Wait, no\u2014the question says to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 generation might not even exist here; instead, we need to look at the F2.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial setup. Because typically, you'd have parents producing F1, then F1 producing F2. Here, the parents are already F1s, and they produce gametes. Then F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct as presented, meaning the parents themselves are F1, and we're considering their cross to get F2. Hmm, that seems odd because F1 generation wouldn't make sense unless the parents were F1. Maybe there's confusion in the question's phrasing.\n\nLet me proceed under the assumption that the question is correctly stated: creating a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Adihybrid refers to a dihybrid cross, which involves two traits. So, the parents are each heterozygous for both genes (C_B_b), making them dihybrids. Their offspring will have various combinations.\n\nWait, but in this case, one parent is homozygous for both genes (CC BB), and the other is homozygous for both (cc bb). So when crossed, all offspring will be Cc Bb, making F1 all Cc Bb. Then F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. So let's focus on that.\n\nEach bird has two pairs of alleles: one for C and one for B. The possible alleles for each gene are uppercase (dominant) or lowercase (recessive).\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parental: CC and cc \u2192 F1: Cc\n- F1: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 F2: CC, Cc, cc\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- Parental: BB and bb \u2192 F1: Bb\n- F1: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 F2: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSince the loci are independent, we can consider them separately. Each gene contributes independently to the phenotype.\n\nSo, the total phenotypic classes depend on the combination of the two genes. Each bird has four possible genotype combinations for the two genes (since each gene is diploid, but we're looking at the combined effect). However, phenotypically, the combination of dominant and recessive alleles will determine the color.\n\nWait, but the question also gives us the mapping: checkered is Cc, plain is cc. Similarly, red is BB, brown is bb. So, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combinations of the two genes:\n\n- Checkered red: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Cc \u00d7 BB = CcBB\n- Checkered brown: Cc \u00d7 bb = Ccbb\n- Plain red: cc \u00d7 BB = ccBB\n- Plain brown: cc \u00d7 bb = ccbb\n\nSo, four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, each gene is independently segregating. For each gene, the probability of each genotype is as follows:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBB (Checkered Red)\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB (Plain Red)\n4. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB (Checkered Red)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, each allele from the first parent (CC BB) combines with each allele from the second parent (cc bb).\n\nSo, for Gene C:\n- From CC, it's always C.\n- From cc, it's always c.\n\nFor Gene B:\n- From BB, it's always B.\n- From bb, it's always b.\n\nThus, the F2 genotype is always Cc Bb. So, the phenotype depends solely on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the F2 generation is being considered, so each bird's phenotype is based on both C and B.\n\nSo, let's think about how many birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Dominant (C): 50% (Cc)\n- Recessive (c): 50% (cc)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Dominant (B): 50% (Bb)\n- Recessive (b): 50% (bb)\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered Red: C dominant and B dominant \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Checkered Brown: C dominant and B recessive \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Red: C recessive and B dominant \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Brown: C recessive and B recessive \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but the question options don\u2019t seem to match this. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, the actual calculation is:\n\nEach trait is independent, so the number of birds in each phenotype is 25%. But the options provided don\u2019t include 25% for any phenotype. Instead, the options suggest more than 25% for some phenotypes.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the phenotypes are based on the entire genotype. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Checkered pattern is C\n- Plain color is c\n- Red color is B\n- Brown is b\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nTherefore, each bird has two alleles for C and two for B. The phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant and recessive alleles in both genes.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"checkered pattern\" as controlled by C, so perhaps the dominance is per allele, but the overall phenotype depends on whether the allele is present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is determined by the presence of either dominant C or dominant B, but that doesn't align with the initial description.\n\nWait, the initial description says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Red color is control by dominant gene B.\n- Brown color by recessive allele b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. The presence of dominant alleles for either gene results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nWait, but the checkered pattern is determined by C. So, perhaps the checkered pattern is expressed when at least one dominant allele exists (either C or B), leading to a checkered appearance. While the color is determined by the other gene.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it methodically.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Checkered pattern: dominant C (C)\n- Plain: recessive c (cc)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Checkered: dominant B (B)\n- Plain: recessive b (bb)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both genes. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C dominant and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Red (C B)\n2. C dominant and B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown (C b)\n3. C recessive and B dominant \u2192 Plain Red (c B)\n4. C recessive and B recessive \u2192 Plain Brown (c b)\n\nNow, in the F2 generation, each gene is independently segregating. So, for each gene, the probability is 25% for each possible genotype.\n\nHowever, the question is about the phenotypic ratio, so we need to count how many birds fall into each phenotype class.\n\nEach bird is a combination of the two genes.

    "rollout": " Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds: one that's checkered red (CCBB) and another that's plain brown (ccbb). We're supposed to create a Punnett square for their offspring, specifically looking at the F2 generation. Then, we need to determine the phenotypic ratios based on the given options.\n\nFirst, let me break down the genes involved. There are two genes mentioned here: one controlling color (B and b) and another controlling pattern (C and c). Since each bird has two copies of each gene, these are definitely linked. \n\nStarting with the parents:\n- The first parent is checkered red, which means both alleles are dominant. So, the genotype would be CC (for color) and BB (for pattern), making it CCBB.\n- The second parent is plain brown, meaning both alleles are recessive. So, the genotype is cc (plain) and bb (brown), resulting in ccbb.\n\nNow, when they mate, their offspring will get one allele from each parent for each gene. Since the parents are homozygous, all the gametes from each parent will carry one allele for each gene. So, the possible gametes from the first parent (CCBB) are CB and CB (since both alleles are dominant). Similarly, the gametes from the second parent (ccbb) will be cb and cb because both alleles are recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right. If the parent is CCBB, then the gametes should have either C or B. But since both parents contribute one allele each, the possible combinations for each gene are:\n\nFor the color gene (B/b):\n- From the first parent: C or C (since CC is homozygous dominant)\n- From the second parent: c or c (since cc is homozygous recessive)\n\nSo, the possible gametes for the color gene are C (from the first parent) and c (from the second parent).\n\nSimilarly, for the pattern gene (C/c):\n- First parent contributes C (from CC)\n- Second parent contributes c (from cc)\n\nSo, the possible gametes for the pattern gene are C (from the first parent) and c (from the second parent).\n\nPutting this together, the four possible combinations for each gene are:\n1. C (color) + C (pattern) \u2192 CC\n2. C (color) + c (pattern) \u2192 Cc\n3. c (color) + C (pattern) \u2192 cC\n4. c (color) + c (pattern) \u2192 cc\n\nBut wait, in terms of actual gamete types, order doesn't matter, so we can represent them as CB, Cc, cB, and cb. However, since the parents are homozygous, all four gametes are present but with different probabilities.\n\nWait, actually, each parent produces gametes independently. The first parent (CCBB) can produce CB gametes, and the second parent (ccbb) can also produce cb gametes. So, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of CB and cb, leading to gametes like CB, cb, etc., but considering all four possibilities.\n\nHowever, when creating the Punnett square, we consider the combination of gametes from both parents. Each parent contributes one allele per gene. So, for each gene, the possible gametes are:\n\nColor (B/b): Parent 1 can produce C or c, and Parent 2 can produce c or c. Wait, no\u2014Parent 1 is CC, so he can only give C. Parent 2 is cc, so she can only give c. That simplifies things.\n\nPattern (C/c): Parent 1 is CC, so gives C. Parent 2 is cc, so gives c. So, the possible gametes are C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2).\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will have all possible combinations of C and c for each gene, but since Parent 1 always gives C and Parent 2 always gives c, every F1 bird will be Cc (color) and c (pattern), so they'll all be Cc c, meaning their phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If Parent 1 is CCBB, his gametes are C and B. Wait, hold on! No\u2014the notation was a bit confusing earlier. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CCBB, which is homozygous for both dominant traits. So, for the color gene (B/b), both alleles are B. For the pattern gene (C/c), both alleles are C. Therefore, all gametes from this parent will carry the same alleles: CB.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is ccbb. Both alleles for color (b) are recessive, and both alleles for pattern (b) are recessive. So, all gametes from this parent will carry cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will receive CB from the first parent and cb from the second parent. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each parent contributes one allele per gene. So, the F1 bird will inherit CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2? No, that can't be right because Parent 1 cannot pass B if he only gives C. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me correct that. If Parent 1 is CCBB, he has two Cs for color and two Bs for pattern. So, he can only produce gametes with C and B, but since both are dominant, any gamete he produces will be CB. Similarly, Parent 2 is ccbb, so she can only produce gametes with c and b, which are recessive, so any gamete she produces will be cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, resulting in CBcb. Wait, but that's impossible because each parent only contributes one allele per gene. So, the F1 bird will have CB for color (since Parent 1 gives C and Parent 2 gives c) and cb for pattern (since Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b). Wait, no\u2014that's not how it works. Each parent contributes one allele per gene, so the F1 bird will have CB (from Parent 1) and cb (from Parent 2), making the genotype CcBb.\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So, the F1 bird is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both color and pattern. Now, when this F1 bird crosses with another F1 bird, which is also CcBb, we can set up the Punnett square.\n\nThe possible gametes from each parent for each gene are:\n\n- Color (B/b): Parent 1 can give B or b. Parent 2 can give B or b.\n- Pattern (C/c): Parent 1 can give C or c. Parent 2 can give C or c.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate because the parents are already producing gametes based on their own alleles. Since each parent is Cc (heterozygous for both genes), the gametes will be random. But for the purpose of this cross, we're focusing on the F1 birds, who are CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I got confused earlier. The F1 generation from the cross of CCBB and ccbb would actually be all CcBb, because each parent can only produce CB gametes (since they are homozygous dominant for both traits). Wait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's start fresh.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CCBB (homozygous dominant for both color and pattern)\n- Parent 2: ccbb (homozygous recessive for both)\n\nPossible gametes from Parent 1: Only CB (since both alleles are dominant).\nPossible gametes from Parent 2: Only cb (since both alleles are recessive).\n\nThus, the F1 generation will be all CcBb (since CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2 combine into CcBb). Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Because each parent contributes one allele per gene, so the F1 bird will have CB (from Parent 1) and cb (from Parent 2), making the genotype CcBb. So, all F1 birds are CcBb.\n\nNow, when these F1 birds (CcBB?) Wait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for Parent 1 (CCBB), he can only give C and B. Similarly, Parent 2 (ccbb) can only give c and b. Therefore, the F1 birds will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, resulting in CcBb.\n\nWait, but this doesn't seem right because each parent only contributes one allele per gene, so the F1 bird will have C and c for the color gene and B and b for the pattern gene. But since Parent 1 can only give C and B, and Parent 2 can only give c and b, the F1 bird will have C and c for color and B and b for pattern. Thus, the F1 bird's genotype is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBB?) No, wait\u2014it's CcBb. So, each F1 bird is CcBb, meaning they are heterozygous for both color and pattern.\n\nNow, we need to determine the F2 generation. F2 is produced by F1 x F1.\n\nIn F1, all individuals are CcBb. When they self-pollinate, the F2 generation will be generated from the F1 parents' gametes. The possible gametes from each F1 parent for each gene are:\n\n- For color (B/b): Parent 1 can give B or b. Parent 2 can give B or b.\n- For pattern (C/c): Parent 1 can give C or c. Parent 2 can give C or c.\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 parent is Cc (heterozygous), so they can produce gametes with a 50% chance of giving C or c. Similarly, for pattern, they can give C or c.\n\nSince the F1 parents are independent, the F2 generation will have all possible combinations of gametes from both parents.\n\nSo, for the color gene (B/b):\n- Parent 1 can give B or b.\n- Parent 2 can give B or b.\n\nThus, the possible gamete combinations are:\n1. B (from Parent 1) and B (from Parent 2) \u2192 BB\n2. B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Bb\n3. b (from Parent 1) and B (from Parent 2) \u2192 Bb\n4. b (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 bb\n\nSimilarly, for the pattern gene (C/c):\n- Parent 1 can give C or c.\n- Parent 2 can give C or c.\n\nPossible gamete combinations:\n1. C (from Parent 1) and C (from Parent 2) \u2192 CC\n2. C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc\n3. c (from Parent 1) and C (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc\n4. c (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2192 cc\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 generation will have all possible combinations of the gametes from both parents for each gene. This results in 4 x 4 = 16 possible genotypic combinations. However, some of these will lead to the same phenotype due to dominance.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant trait is expressed. So, for color (B/b), if an individual has at least one B, they express color B. Similarly, for pattern (C/c), if at least one C, they express pattern C.\n- The recessive trait (b for color and c for pattern) is only expressed when both alleles are recessive.\n\nSo, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. BB (color B, pattern C) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Bb (color B, pattern C) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Bb (color B, pattern c) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb (color b, pattern C) \u2192 Plain red\n5. Bc (color B, pattern c) \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Bc (color b, pattern C) \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. Bc (color b, pattern c) \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. bc (color b, pattern c) \u2192 Plain brown\n9. CC (color C, pattern C) \u2192 Plain red\n10. Cc (color C, pattern C) \u2192 Plain red\n11. Cc (color C, pattern c) \u2192 Plain red\n12. cc (color c, pattern C) \u2192 Plain brown\n13. CC (color C, pattern c) \u2192 Plain red\n14. Cc (color C, pattern c) \u2192 Plain red\n15. Cc (color C, pattern c) \u2192 Plain red\n16. cc (color c, pattern c) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered red (BR)**: Phenotype 1 (BB) and Phenotype 8 (bc). Wait, no\u2014phenotype 1 is BB (Checkered red), and Phenotypes 8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16 are all bc (Plain brown). Wait, no\u2014phenotype 8 is bc (plain brown), and Phenotypes 9-16 include various cases where color is b except for Phenotype 8.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the categorization. Let's re-express:\n\nPhenotype 1: BB (Checkered red) \u2192 Count 1\nPhenotype 2: Bb (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 2\nPhenotype 3: Bb (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 3 (but since it's the same phenotype, count once)\nPhenotype 4: bb (Plain red) \u2192 Count 4\nPhenotype 5: Bc (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 5\nPhenotype 6: Bc (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 6 (same as 5)\nPhenotype 7: Bc (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 7 (same as 5)\nPhenotype 8: bc (Plain brown) \u2192 Count 8\nPhenotype 9: CC (Plain red) \u2192 Count 9\nPhenotype 10: Cc (Plain red) \u2192 Count 10\nPhenotype 11: Cc (Plain red) \u2192 Count 11\nPhenotype 12: cc (Plain brown) \u2192 Count 12\nPhenotype 13: CC (Plain red) \u2192 Count 13\nPhenotype 14: Cc (Plain red) \u2192 Count 14\nPhenotype 15: Cc (Plain red) \u2192 Count 15\nPhenotype 16: cc (Plain brown) \u2192 Count 16\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Pheno 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 counts?\nWait, no\u2014Pheno 2 and 3 are both Bb, so they belong to the same phenotype, which is Checkered brown. Wait, no\u2014no, Pheno 1 is BB (Checkered red), Pheno 2 and 3 are Bb (Checkered brown), Pheno 4 is bb (Plain red), Pheno 5-8 are Bc (Checkered brown), Pheno 9-16 are cc (Plain brown).\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list each phenotype correctly:\n\n- **Checkered red (B/B or R/R)**: Phenotype 1 (BB) and Phenotype 4 (bc). Wait, no\u2014Pheno 1 is BB (Checkered red), and Phenotype 4 is bc (Plain brown). So, Checkered red is only Phenotype 1 (BB). Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n- If an individual has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it expresses that trait. Otherwise, it's recessive.\n\nSo, for color (B/b):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Brown\n\nFor pattern (C/c):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Black (or red in this case)\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, the colors correspond to B (Red) and b (Brown), while pattern corresponds to C (Black) and c (Brown). So, the phenotypes are based on having at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, \"red\" is dominant, and \"brown\" is recessive. So, the presence of a dominant allele for either trait leads to its coloration. So, if you have at least one dominant allele for either color or pattern, you display that color or pattern.\n\nWait, but in the problem, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, the presence of at least one red allele makes the bird red, regardless of the pattern. Conversely, if you have at least one brown allele, you display brown, regardless of the color.\n\nThis changes everything. So, let's recast the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- **Checkered red (R/R and B/B)**: Both dominant, so red.\n- **Checkered brown (R/R and c/c)**: Brown.\n- **Plain red (r/r and B/B)**: Red.\n- **Plain brown (r/r and c/c)**: Brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the problem states that red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, any bird with at least one red allele displays red, and any bird with at least one brown allele displays brown. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait determines the phenotype.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n1. Checkered red (both dominant for color and pattern)\n2. Checkered brown (only dominant for pattern)\n3. Plain red (only dominant for color)\n4. Plain brown (only dominant for pattern)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, the presence of at least one red allele makes the bird red, and the presence of at least one brown allele makes it brown.\n\nSo, let's redefine the phenotypes based on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait:\n\n- **Checkered red (B/B and C/C)**: Both color and pattern are dominant \u2192 red.\n- **Checkered brown (B/B and c/c)**: Color is dominant",

Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds: one that's checkered red (CCBB) and another that's plain brown (ccbb).

C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc\n3. c (from Parent 1) and C (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc\n4. c (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2192 cc\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 generation will have all possible combinations of the gametes from both parents for each gene. This results in 4 x 4 = 16 possible genotypic combinations. However, some of these will lead to the same phenotype due to dominance.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant trait is expressed. So, for color (B/b), if an individual has at least one B, they express color B. Similarly, for pattern (C/c), if at least one C, they express pattern C.\n- The recessive trait (b for color and c for pattern) is only expressed when both alleles are recessive.\n\nSo, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. BB (color B, pattern C) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Bb (color B, pattern C) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Bb (color B, pattern c) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. bb (color b, pattern C) \u2192 Plain red\n5. Bc (color B, pattern c) \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Bc (color b, pattern C) \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. Bc (color b, pattern c) \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. bc (color b, pattern c) \u2192 Plain brown\n9. CC (color C, pattern C) \u2192 Plain red\n10. Cc (color C, pattern C) \u2192 Plain red\n11. Cc (color C, pattern c) \u2192 Plain red\n12. cc (color c, pattern C) \u2192 Plain brown\n13. CC (color C, pattern c) \u2192 Plain red\n14. Cc (color C, pattern c) \u2192 Plain red\n15. Cc (color C, pattern c) \u2192 Plain red\n16. cc (color c, pattern c) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered red (BR)**: Phenotype 1 (BB) and Phenotype 8 (bc). Wait, no\u2014phenotype 1 is BB (Checkered red), and Phenotypes 8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16 are all bc (Plain brown). Wait, no\u2014phenotype 8 is bc (plain brown), and Phenotypes 9-16 include various cases where color is b except for Phenotype 8.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the categorization. Let's re-express:\n\nPhenotype 1: BB (Checkered red) \u2192 Count 1\nPhenotype 2: Bb (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 2\nPhenotype 3: Bb (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 3 (but since it's the same phenotype, count once)\nPhenotype 4: bb (Plain red) \u2192 Count 4\nPhenotype 5: Bc (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 5\nPhenotype 6: Bc (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 6 (same as 5)\nPhenotype 7: Bc (Checkered brown) \u2192 Count 7 (same as 5)\nPhenotype 8: bc (Plain brown) \u2192 Count 8\nPhenotype 9: CC (Plain red) \u2192 Count 9\nPhenotype 10: Cc (Plain red) \u2192 Count 10\nPhenotype 11: Cc (Plain red) \u2192 Count 11\nPhenotype 12: cc (Plain brown) \u2192 Count 12\nPhenotype 13: CC (Plain red) \u2192 Count 13\nPhenotype 14: Cc (Plain red) \u2192 Count 14\nPhenotype 15: Cc (Plain red) \u2192 Count 15\nPhenotype 16: cc (Plain brown) \u2192 Count 16\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Pheno 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 counts?\nWait, no\u2014Pheno 2 and 3 are both Bb, so they belong to the same phenotype, which is Checkered brown. Wait, no\u2014no, Pheno 1 is BB (Checkered red), Pheno 2 and 3 are Bb (Checkered brown), Pheno 4 is bb (Plain red), Pheno 5-8 are Bc (Checkered brown), Pheno 9-16 are cc (Plain brown).\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list each phenotype correctly:\n\n- **Checkered red (B/B or R/R)**: Phenotype 1 (BB) and Phenotype 4 (bc). Wait, no\u2014Pheno 1 is BB (Checkered red), and Phenotype 4 is bc (Plain brown). So, Checkered red is only Phenotype 1 (BB). Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n- If an individual has at least one dominant allele for a trait, it expresses that trait. Otherwise, it's recessive.\n\nSo, for color (B/b):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Brown\n\nFor pattern (C/c):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Black (or red in this case)\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, the colors correspond to B (Red) and b (Brown), while pattern corresponds to C (Black) and c (Brown). So, the phenotypes are based on having at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, \"red\" is dominant, and \"brown\" is recessive. So, the presence of a dominant allele for either trait leads to its coloration. So, if you have at least one dominant allele for either color or pattern, you display that color or pattern.\n\nWait, but in the problem, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, the presence of at least one red allele makes the bird red, regardless of the pattern. Conversely, if you have at least one brown allele, you display brown, regardless of the color.\n\nThis changes everything. So, let's recast the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- **Checkered red (R/R and B/B)**: Both dominant, so red.\n- **Checkered brown (R/R and c/c)**: Brown.\n- **Plain red (r/r and B/B)**: Red.\n- **Plain brown (r/r and c/c)**: Brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the problem states that red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, any bird with at least one red allele displays red, and any bird with at least one brown allele displays brown. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait determines the phenotype.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n1. Checkered red (both dominant for color and pattern)\n2. Checkered brown (only dominant for pattern)\n3. Plain red (only dominant for color)\n4. Plain brown (only dominant for pattern)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, the presence of at least one red allele makes the bird red, and the presence of at least one brown allele makes it brown.\n\nSo, let's redefine the phenotypes based on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait:\n\n- **Checkered red (B/B and C/C)**: Both color and pattern are dominant \u2192 red.\n- **Checkered brown (B/B and c/c)**: Color is dominant",

    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's given.\n\nWe have two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means both its parents are CC BB. So the genotype would be CC BB, right? And since they're homozygous, all their offspring will also be CC BB because there are no other alleles to mix.\n\nThe other bird is a plain brown, which is represented as cc bb. So that bird has the genotype cc bb.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the Punnett square for an adihybridcross between these two. Wait, but hold on\u2014the first bird is already homozygous, so when we cross it with another bird, the F1 generation will just inherit the alleles from that bird. But wait, the question says \"adahybridcross,\" which usually refers to dihybrid crosses where you consider two traits at once. But here, maybe it's referring to a cross between two different genotypes.\n\nWait, let me read again. It says, \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Oh, okay, so actually, the cross is between a homozygous bird (CC BB) and a heterozygous bird (cc bb). That makes more sense now.\n\nSo the F1 generation will consist of the offspring of CC BB and cc bb. Since one parent is homozygous and the other is heterozygous, each offspring will get either C or c from the first parent and c or b from the second. So the possible gametes from the first parent (CC BB) can't carry any extra alleles\u2014they'll always pass C. From the second parent (cc bb), the gametes will be cb, bc, or cc, depending on how they split.\n\nBut wait, in reality, birds produce eggs with one allele each. So the F1 will have combinations like Cc Bb, Cc bb, cC Bb, etc., but since the first parent is CC BB, all their gametes will be CB, CB, BC, or BB? No, wait\u2014no, the first parent is CC BB, so all its gametes will be CB because it's homozygous. Wait, no, if the bird is CC BB, then all its gametes will be CB, because both alleles are C and B. The second bird is cc bb, so its gametes will be cb, bc, or cc. So the F1 will have gametes from the first parent being CB, and from the second parent being cb, bc, cc. Therefore, the F1 genotypes will be:\n\nFrom CB and cb: Cc Bb\n\nFrom CB and bc: Cc bb\n\nFrom CB and cc: Cc cc\n\nSimilarly, from CB and cb: same as before, so those are three distinct F1 genotypes. Now, we can make a Punnett square considering all four possibilities.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible F1 genotypes directly. Since the first parent is CC BB, all its gametes will be CB. The second parent is cc bb, so all its gametes will be cb. So when they mate, the F1 will receive one allele from each parent. So the F1 genotype will be Cc Bb. Because from the first parent, it's CB, and from the second parent, it's cb, combining gives Cc Bb.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because the first parent is CC BB, so it can only give CB, and the second parent is cc bb, giving cb. So F1 would be Cc Bb. But wait, why isn't there a variation? Because the F1 bird would always be Cc Bb, meaning they would always display certain phenotypes.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. If the first parent is CC BB, it can only contribute C and B. The second parent is cc bb, contributing c and b. So the F1 would be Cc Bb. So all F1 birds would be Cc Bb, meaning they'd be checkered and brown. So their phenotype would be checkered brown.\n\nThen, when these F1 birds (all Cc Bb) mate, the next generation (F2) would have various combinations. But wait, the question asks specifically about the F2 generation, not F1. So I might have misread the problem. It says, \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\"\n\nWait, but if the first cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1 Cc Bb, and then F1 selfs to produce F2, which is needed for the phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, maybe the initial setup was wrong, and the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1, and then looking at F2.\n\nLet me try again. The first cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). All the offspring from this cross will be Cc Bb, so all F1 will be Cc Bb. Then, the F1 will self to produce F2. In this case, the F2 will have a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the possible genotypes for each trait are:\n\nFor the first trait (C and c):\n\n- Homozygous dominant (CC)\n- Heterozygous (Cc)\n- Homozygous recessive (cc)\n\nSame for the second trait (B and b):\n\n- Homozygous dominant (BB)\n- Heterozygous (Bb)\n- Homozygous recessive (bb)\n\nSince the F1 is Cc Bb, which is a dihybrid, the F2 will follow the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nBut let's break it down.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Checkered is dominant over plain. So if an animal has at least one dominant allele for color, it will be checkered.\n- Brown is recessive, so only animals with bb (for the b allele) will be plain brown.\n\nWait, the second trait is brown (b) and plain (B). So an animal will be brown if it has at least one b allele. Otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes depend on both traits. An animal will be:\n\n- Checkered: if it has at least one dominant allele for color (either B or b), regardless of the other trait.\n\n- Plain brown: if it has neither dominant alleles (so both are recessive: Bb and bb).\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. For the second trait, brown is recessive (b), so only animals with bb (for the b allele) will be plain brown. For the first trait, checkered is dominant (B), so any presence of B results in checkered, unless it's recessive, i.e., bb.\n\nWait, no. The dominance hierarchy is such that dominant alleles mask the recessive ones. So for the first trait (color), the dominant allele is B, so any presence of B results in checkered, and only bb is plain. Similarly, for the second trait (brown), the dominant allele is B, so any presence of B results in brown, and only bb is plain brown.\n\nTherefore, an animal will be:\n\n- Checkered and brown (C_B_): any combination except bb for the first trait, and B_ for the second.\n\nWait, no. Actually, to be checkered, at least one B must be present (C_), and to be brown, at least one b must be present (b _ ). So the only time an animal is plain brown is when it has bb for the first trait (so Cc for the first trait), and also bb for the second trait (so Bb for the second trait). So the only plain brown animal is Cc Bb.\n\nAll others will have either checkered or brown, but some may be checkered brown or plain checkered?\n\nWait, let's think:\n\n- If an animal is Cc B_, it will be checkered (because of the C) and brown (because of the B). So checkered brown.\n\n- If an animal is Cc _b, it will be checkered (because of C) and brown (because of b). So checkered brown.\n\n- If an animal is _c B_, it will be plain (because c) and brown (because of B). So plain brown.\n\n- If an animal is _c _b, it will be plain (because c) and brown (because of b). So plain brown.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Let me use the standard notation:\n\nCheckered = presence of B (dominant)\n\nPlain brown = presence of b for the second trait (so for the second trait, the individual must be bb).\n\nThus, an animal will be:\n\n- Checkered and brown (C_B_): Any combination where C is present (C_) and B is present (B_). This includes Cc B_, Cc Bb, etc.\n\n- Plain brown (cb b_): Both traits are plain. Only when both are recessive (c and b).\n\nWait, no, because the first trait is C_, which is checkered, but the second trait is b_. So for an animal to be plain brown, it needs to have c (from the first trait) and b (from the second trait). So it must be Cc bb. Because C_ ensures it's checkered, and bb ensures it's plain brown.\n\nSimilarly, an animal could be Cc Bb, which would be checkered and brown, hence checkered brown.\n\nAnd finally, an animal could be c c bb, which is plain and brown, thus plain brown.\n\nWait, no, because for the first trait, if it's cc, it's plain, but for the second trait, it's brown (since b_). So c c bb would be plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to the previous logic, the plain brown is when both traits are plain, i.e., c and b. So c c bb is plain brown.\n\nBut according to the initial problem statement, the checkered pattern is due to the dominant gene C, and plain is recessive. So an animal will be checkered if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), and plain brown if it has at least one recessive allele for the second trait (b). So, an animal will be:\n\n- Checkered and brown (C_B_): Any where C is present and B is present.\n\n- Checkered and plain (only if B is absent, so C_ and c), but wait, no. Because checkered requires at least one B, so C_ ensures that. Plain brown requires that the second trait is plain, which is bb, so the first trait can be anything else (Cc, Cc, etc.), but the second trait must be bb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for color and two alleles for shape.\n\nColor: dominant B \u2192 checkered; recessive b \u2192 plain.\n\nShape: dominant B \u2192 brown; recessive b \u2192 plain brown.\n\nAn animal's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nSo for color, if it has at least one B, it's checkered; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nFor shape, if it has at least one B, it's brown; otherwise, it's plain brown.\n\nThus, an animal can be:\n\n- Checkered and brown (C_B_): At least one B and at least one B.\n\nWhich includes Cc B_, Cc Bb, Cc _b, etc.\n\n- Checkered and plain (C_ bb): At least one B and at least one b.\n\nThis includes Cc bb, Cc Bb, Cc _b, Cb bb, etc.\n\n- Plain and brown (_c B_): At least one b and at least one B.\n\nOnly possible when both are present: Cc B_, Cc Bb, Cc _b, Cb B_, etc.\n\n- Plain and brown (_c _b): At least one b and at least one b for the second trait.\n\nWhich is only possible when both are present: c c bb.\n\nWait, no. For the second trait, if it's bb, that's plain brown. But the first trait can be anything. So c c bb is plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, an animal is plain brown only if both traits are plain, i.e., both are bb. So c c bb is plain brown.\n\nWhereas, c c Bb would be checkered and brown (checkered because at least one B, brown because B is present). Similarly, Cc c b would be brown and plain (because the second trait is b, which is plain, but the first trait is C, which is checkered).\n\nWait, no. If the first trait is C_, it's checkered; if it's cc, it's plain. The second trait, if it's bb, it's plain brown; if it's b_, it's brown.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- Cc B_: Checkered and brown.\n\n- Cc Bb: Same as above.\n\n- Cc _b: Same as above.\n\n- Cc bb: Checkered and plain brown.\n\n- Cc B_ (wait, no, B_ is brown, so Cc B_ would be checkered and brown.\n\nWait, this seems redundant. Let me list all possible genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for each trait:\n\nColor (C/B):\n- C_ : Checkered\n- cc : Plain\n\nShape (B/b):\n- B_ : Brown\n- bb : Plain Brown\n\nCombining both:\n\n1. C_ B_ : Checkered and Brown (C_B_)\n2. C_ bb : Checkered and Plain Brown (C_bb)\n3. cc B_ : Plain and Brown (cb B_)\n4. cc bb : Plain and Plain Brown (cb bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered Plain Brown\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Plain and Plain Brown\n\nWait, no. Because for each bird, the phenotype depends on both traits. So:\n\n- C_ B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C_ bb \u2192 Checkered Plain Brown\n- cc B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and Plain Brown\n\nWait, but in reality, an animal cannot be both checkered and plain. Because if it's C_ for color, it's checkered, and if it's bb for the second trait, it's plain brown. So the phenotype is either Checkered Brown, Checkered Plain Brown, Plain Brown, or Plain and Plain Brown.\n\nWait, but the fourth option, plain and plain brown, is impossible because if it's cc for the first trait, it's plain, but if it's bb for the second trait, it's plain brown. So the fourth option is not possible. Instead, the fourth option should be the same as the third, because being cc (plain) and bb (plain brown) is the same as being plain and plain brown, but in reality, it's simply plain brown, because the second trait overrides.\n\nWait, no, because the second trait determines if it's brown or plain. So an animal with cc (plain) and B_ (brown) would be plain brown. If it's cc (plain) and bb (plain brown), it would still be plain brown because the second trait takes precedence. So the fourth option is the same as the third.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. If an animal is cc (plain) and B_ (brown), it's plain brown. If it's cc (plain) and bb (plain brown), it's still plain brown because the second trait overrides. So all animals with cc (plain) will be plain brown, regardless of the second trait. So the fourth phenotype is the same as the third.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Plain Brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cb B_ and cb bb, but since cb bb is the same as plain brown, it's just Plain Brown)\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of any B allele makes it checkered, and the presence of any b allele makes it brown. So:\n\n- C_ B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C_ bb \u2192 Checkered Plain Brown\n- cc B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (since bb is brown, even though it's plain for the first trait)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered Plain Brown\n3. Plain Brown\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in a dihybrid cross (assuming F2 generation after selfing F1 Cc Bb):\n\nThe F2 genotypes for each trait:\n\n- Color: C_ (9/16), cc (3/16)\n- Shape: B_ (9/16), bb (3/16)\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of these.\n\nTo find the proportion of each phenotype, we can multiply the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, Checkered Brown (C_ B_): (9/16) * (9/16) = 81/256\n\nCheckered Plain Brown (C_ bb): (9/16) * (3/16) = 27/256\n\nPlain Brown (cc B_): (3/16) * (9/16) = 27/256\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up correctly. Let me calculate each phenotype separately.\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_ B_): Probability is (C_) * (B_) = (9/16) * (9/16) = 81/256 \u2248 31.6%\n\n2. Checkered Plain Brown (C_ bb): (9/16) * (3/16) = 27/256 \u2248 10.6%\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_): (3/16) * (9/16) = 27/256 \u2248 10.6%\n\n4. Plain Brown (cc bb): (3/16) * (3/16) = 9/256 \u2248 3.5%\n\nAdding them up: 81 + 27 + 27 + 9 = 144/256, which simplifies to 9/16. Wait, that can't be right because the total should sum to 1. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate.\n\nActually, the correct way is to consider that the phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- Checkered and brown: (probability of at least one B) * (probability of at least one B) \u2192 Not exactly, because for the phenotype, it's the combination of both traits.\n\nAlternatively, using the Punnett square approach for dihybrid crosses:\n\nThe Punnett square for two independent traits would have 16 possible outcomes, but since each trait is independently segreg",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's given.\n\nWe have two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means both its parents are CC BB. So the genotype would be CC BB, right? And since they're homozygous, all their offspring will also be CC BB because there are no other alleles to mix.\n\nThe other bird is a plain brown, which is represented as cc bb. So that bird has the genotype cc bb.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the Punnett square for an adihybridcross between these two.

It says, \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Oh, okay, so actually, the cross is between a homozygous bird (CC BB) and a heterozygous bird (cc bb). That makes more sense now.\n\nSo the F1 generation will consist of the offspring of CC BB and cc bb.

So the F1 will have combinations like Cc Bb, Cc bb, cC Bb, etc., but since the first parent is CC BB, all their gametes will be CB, CB, BC, or BB? No, wait\u2014no, the first parent is CC BB, so all its gametes will be CB because it's homozygous. Wait, no, if the bird is CC BB, then all its gametes will be CB, because both alleles are C and B. The second bird is cc bb, so its gametes will be cb, bc, or cc. So the F1 will have gametes from the first parent being CB, and from the second parent being cb, bc, cc. Therefore, the F1 genotypes will be:\n\nFrom CB and cb: Cc Bb\n\nFrom CB and bc: Cc bb\n\nFrom CB and cc: Cc cc\n\nSimilarly, from CB and cb: same as before, so those are three distinct F1 genotypes. Now, we can make a Punnett square considering all four possibilities.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible F1 genotypes directly. Since the first parent is CC BB, all its gametes will be CB. The second parent is cc bb, so all its gametes will be cb. So when they mate, the F1 will receive one allele from each parent. So the F1 genotype will be Cc Bb. Because from the first parent, it's CB, and from the second parent, it's cb, combining gives Cc Bb.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because the first parent is CC BB, so it can only give CB, and the second parent is cc bb, giving cb. So F1 would be Cc Bb. But wait, why isn't there a variation? Because the F1 bird would always be Cc Bb, meaning they would always display certain phenotypes.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. If the first parent is CC BB, it can only contribute C and B. The second parent is cc bb, contributing c and b. So the F1 would be Cc Bb. So all F1 birds would be Cc Bb, meaning they'd be checkered and brown. So their phenotype would be checkered brown.\n\nThen, when these F1 birds (all Cc Bb) mate, the next generation (F2) would have various combinations. But wait, the question asks specifically about the F2 generation, not F1. So I might have misread the problem. It says, \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\"\n\nWait, but if the first cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1 Cc Bb, and then F1 selfs to produce F2, which is needed for the phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, maybe the initial setup was wrong, and the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1, and then looking at F2.\n\nLet me try again. The first cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). All the offspring from this cross will be Cc Bb, so all F1 will be Cc Bb. Then, the F1 will self to produce F2. In this case, the F2 will have a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the possible genotypes for each trait are:\n\nFor the first trait (C and c):\n\n- Homozygous dominant (CC)\n- Heterozygous (Cc)\n- Homozygous recessive (cc)\n\nSame for the second trait (B and b):\n\n- Homozygous dominant (BB)\n- Heterozygous (Bb)\n- Homozygous recessive (bb)\n\nSince the F1 is Cc Bb, which is a dihybrid, the F2 will follow the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nBut let's break it down.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Checkered is dominant over plain. So if an animal has at least one dominant allele for color, it will be checkered.\n- Brown is recessive, so only animals with bb (for the b allele) will be plain brown.\n\nWait, the second trait is brown (b) and plain (B). So an animal will be brown if it has at least one b allele. Otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes depend on both traits. An animal will be:\n\n- Checkered: if it has at least one dominant allele for color (either B or b), regardless of the other trait.\n\n- Plain brown: if it has neither dominant alleles (so both are recessive: Bb and bb).\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. For the second trait, brown is recessive (b), so only animals with bb (for the b allele) will be plain brown. For the first trait, checkered is dominant (B), so any presence of B results in checkered, unless it's recessive, i.e., bb.\n\nWait, no. The dominance hierarchy is such that dominant alleles mask the recessive ones. So for the first trait (color), the dominant allele is B, so any presence of B results in checkered, and only bb is plain. Similarly, for the second trait (brown), the dominant allele is B, so any presence of B results in brown, and only bb is plain brown.\n\nTherefore, an animal will be:\n\n- Checkered and brown (C_B_): any combination except bb for the first trait, and B_ for the second.\n\nWait, no. Actually, to be checkered, at least one B must be present (C_), and to be brown, at least one b must be present (b _ ). So the only time an animal is plain brown is when it has bb for the first trait (so Cc for the first trait), and also bb for the second trait (so Bb for the second trait). So the only plain brown animal is Cc Bb.\n\nAll others will have either checkered or brown, but some may be checkered brown or plain checkered?\n\nWait, let's think:\n\n- If an animal is Cc B_, it will be checkered (because of the C) and brown (because of the B). So checkered brown.\n\n- If an animal is Cc _b, it will be checkered (because of C) and brown (because of b). So checkered brown.\n\n- If an animal is _c B_, it will be plain (because c) and brown (because of B). So plain brown.\n\n- If an animal is _c _b, it will be plain (because c) and brown (because of b). So plain brown.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Let me use the standard notation:\n\nCheckered = presence of B (dominant)\n\nPlain brown = presence of b for the second trait (so for the second trait, the individual must be bb).\n\nThus, an animal will be:\n\n- Checkered and brown (C_B_): Any combination where C is present (C_) and B is present (B_). This includes Cc B_, Cc Bb, etc.\n\n- Plain brown (cb b_): Both traits are plain. Only when both are recessive (c and b).\n\nWait, no, because the first trait is C_, which is checkered, but the second trait is b_. So for an animal to be plain brown, it needs to have c (from the first trait) and b (from the second trait). So it must be Cc bb. Because C_ ensures it's checkered, and bb ensures it's plain brown.\n\nSimilarly, an animal could be Cc Bb, which would be checkered and brown, hence checkered brown.\n\nAnd finally, an animal could be c c bb, which is plain and brown, thus plain brown.\n\nWait, no, because for the first trait, if it's cc, it's plain, but for the second trait, it's brown (since b_). So c c bb would be plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to the previous logic, the plain brown is when both traits are plain, i.e., c and b. So c c bb is plain brown.\n\nBut according to the initial problem statement, the checkered pattern is due to the dominant gene C, and plain is recessive. So an animal will be checkered if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), and plain brown if it has at least one recessive allele for the second trait (b). So, an animal will be:\n\n- Checkered and brown (C_B_): Any where C is present and B is present.\n\n- Checkered and plain (only if B is absent, so C_ and c), but wait, no. Because checkered requires at least one B, so C_ ensures that. Plain brown requires that the second trait is plain, which is bb, so the first trait can be anything else (Cc, Cc, etc.), but the second trait must be bb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for color and two alleles for shape.\n\nColor: dominant B \u2192 checkered; recessive b \u2192 plain.\n\nShape: dominant B \u2192 brown; recessive b \u2192 plain brown.\n\nAn animal's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nSo for color, if it has at least one B, it's checkered; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nFor shape, if it has at least one B, it's brown; otherwise, it's plain brown.\n\nThus, an animal can be:\n\n- Checkered and brown (C_B_): At least one B and at least one B.\n\nWhich includes Cc B_, Cc Bb, Cc _b, etc.\n\n- Checkered and plain (C_ bb): At least one B and at least one b.\n\nThis includes Cc bb, Cc Bb, Cc _b, Cb bb, etc.\n\n- Plain and brown (_c B_): At least one b and at least one B.\n\nOnly possible when both are present: Cc B_, Cc Bb, Cc _b, Cb B_, etc.\n\n- Plain and brown (_c _b): At least one b and at least one b for the second trait.\n\nWhich is only possible when both are present: c c bb.\n\nWait, no. For the second trait, if it's bb, that's plain brown. But the first trait can be anything. So c c bb is plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, an animal is plain brown only if both traits are plain, i.e., both are bb. So c c bb is plain brown.\n\nWhereas, c c Bb would be checkered and brown (checkered because at least one B, brown because B is present). Similarly, Cc c b would be brown and plain (because the second trait is b, which is plain, but the first trait is C, which is checkered).\n\nWait, no. If the first trait is C_, it's checkered; if it's cc, it's plain. The second trait, if it's bb, it's plain brown; if it's b_, it's brown.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- Cc B_: Checkered and brown.\n\n- Cc Bb: Same as above.\n\n- Cc _b: Same as above.\n\n- Cc bb: Checkered and plain brown.\n\n- Cc B_ (wait, no, B_ is brown, so Cc B_ would be checkered and brown.\n\nWait, this seems redundant. Let me list all possible genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for each trait:\n\nColor (C/B):\n- C_ : Checkered\n- cc : Plain\n\nShape (B/b):\n- B_ : Brown\n- bb : Plain Brown\n\nCombining both:\n\n1. C_ B_ : Checkered and Brown (C_B_)\n2. C_ bb : Checkered and Plain Brown (C_bb)\n3. cc B_ : Plain and Brown (cb B_)\n4. cc bb : Plain and Plain Brown (cb bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered Plain Brown\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Plain and Plain Brown\n\nWait, no. Because for each bird, the phenotype depends on both traits. So:\n\n- C_ B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C_ bb \u2192 Checkered Plain Brown\n- cc B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and Plain Brown\n\nWait, but in reality, an animal cannot be both checkered and plain. Because if it's C_ for color, it's checkered, and if it's bb for the second trait, it's plain brown. So the phenotype is either Checkered Brown, Checkered Plain Brown, Plain Brown, or Plain and Plain Brown.\n\nWait, but the fourth option, plain and plain brown, is impossible because if it's cc for the first trait, it's plain, but if it's bb for the second trait, it's plain brown. So the fourth option is not possible. Instead, the fourth option should be the same as the third, because being cc (plain) and bb (plain brown) is the same as being plain and plain brown, but in reality, it's simply plain brown, because the second trait overrides.\n\nWait, no, because the second trait determines if it's brown or plain. So an animal with cc (plain) and B_ (brown) would be plain brown. If it's cc (plain) and bb (plain brown), it would still be plain brown because the second trait takes precedence. So the fourth option is the same as the third.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. If an animal is cc (plain) and B_ (brown), it's plain brown. If it's cc (plain) and bb (plain brown), it's still plain brown because the second trait overrides. So all animals with cc (plain) will be plain brown, regardless of the second trait. So the fourth phenotype is the same as the third.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Plain Brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cb B_ and cb bb, but since cb bb is the same as plain brown, it's just Plain Brown)\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of any B allele makes it checkered, and the presence of any b allele makes it brown. So:\n\n- C_ B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C_ bb \u2192 Checkered Plain Brown\n- cc B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (since bb is brown, even though it's plain for the first trait)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown\n2. Checkered Plain Brown\n3. Plain Brown\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in a dihybrid cross (assuming F2 generation after selfing F1 Cc Bb):\n\nThe F2 genotypes for each trait:\n\n- Color: C_ (9/16), cc (3/16)\n- Shape: B_ (9/16), bb (3/16)\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of these.\n\nTo find the proportion of each phenotype, we can multiply the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, Checkered Brown (C_ B_): (9/16) * (9/16) = 81/256\n\nCheckered Plain Brown (C_ bb): (9/16) * (3/16) = 27/256\n\nPlain Brown (cc B_): (3/16) * (9/16) = 27/256\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up correctly. Let me calculate each phenotype separately.\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_ B_): Probability is (C_) * (B_) = (9/16) * (9/16) = 81/256 \u2248 31.6%\n\n2. Checkered Plain Brown (C_ bb): (9/16) * (3/16) = 27/256 \u2248 10.6%\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_): (3/16) * (9/16) = 27/256 \u2248 10.6%\n\n4. Plain Brown (cc bb): (3/16) * (3/16) = 9/256 \u2248 3.5%\n\nAdding them up: 81 + 27 + 27 + 9 = 144/256, which simplifies to 9/16. Wait, that can't be right because the total should sum to 1. Hmm, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate.\n\nActually, the correct way is to consider that the phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- Checkered and brown: (probability of at least one B) * (probability of at least one B) \u2192 Not exactly, because for the phenotype, it's the combination of both traits.\n\nAlternatively, using the Punnett square approach for dihybrid crosses:\n\nThe Punnett square for two independent traits would have 16 possible outcomes, but since each trait is independently segreg",

    "rollout": " It's about animal crosses and Punnett squares, which I remember from my biology class. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions four traits: color and dominance. There are two genes involved here\u2014gene C for checking or not, and gene B for red or brown. So each bird has two alleles for these genes. \n\nThe setup says that the dominant gene C controls the checkered pattern, meaning that if someone has at least one C allele, they'll have a checkered pattern. The recessive allele c means no checkered. Then, gene B determines color: a dominant B means red, and a recessive b means brown. So combining these, we get different phenotypes based on both genes.\n\nNow, there's an adhybridcross between two birds: one is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is plain brown (cc bb). Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So for the first parent, since they're red, their genotype must be CC BB because they can't be anything else without another B allele. Wait, but wait\u2014no, actually, if they're red, they have at least one B, right? But being homozygous would mean both are B. So CC BB makes sense. Similarly, the second parent is plain brown, so their genotype is cc bb, meaning both are b for the B gene.\n\nWhen they mate, the offspring will have combinations of these alleles. Since it's a cross of CC BB and cc bb, all the offspring should be Cc Bb because they inherit one allele from each parent. That's the F1 generation.\n\nBut the question isn't just about the F1\u2014it goes up to the F2 generation. So I need to consider what happens when F1 flies produce gametes, and then those gametes form F2 pairs.\n\nLooking at the options provided, A through H, each gives a different phenotypic ratio. My task is to determine which one is correct.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I'll outline the possible genotypes in the F1. Each parent contributes either C or c for gene C, and B or b for gene B. So the F1 can have four types:\n\n- Cc for gene C,\n- Bb for gene B.\n\nSo the F1 individuals will be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, each F1 bird will have one C and one c allele for gene C, and one B and one b allele for gene B. So their genotypes are Cc Bb.\n\nNow, when they mate (to get F2), each bird will produce gametes that are combinations of their alleles. For gene C, the parents are CC (which produces C gametes) and cc (which produces c gametes). So the F2 will have a 50% chance of passing C and 50% of c.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B, the parents are BB (produces B gametes) and bb (produces b gametes). So the F2 for gene B will also have a 50% chance of passing B and 50% of b.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the F2 dihybrid will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the phenotypes. But let's verify this with the actual letters.\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but I think the way the letters combine is that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So each combination will result in a specific phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the counts for each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdding them up, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so the total would be 25% each. However, looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that the bird is described as \"checkered\" when both C and c are present. Hmm, but no\u2014the term \"checkered\" might refer to the overall pattern, regardless of whether it's red or brown. So perhaps \"checkered red\" refers to having the C allele, regardless of the B. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Dominant gene C controls the checkered pattern.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Red color is determined by dominant gene B.\n- Brown by recessive allele b.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB (since C is present, and B is present)\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb\n- Plain Red: cc BB\n- Plain Brown: cc Bb\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, assuming independent assortment. But some of these might overlap in terms of phenotype description. Wait, no, each phenotype is distinct based on the presence of C and B.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user mentioned the phenotypic ratio for F2 as option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that doesn't add up. If each phenotype is 25%, across the entire population, then each should be roughly equal. But in F2, the numbers may vary slightly due to genetic laws.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial cross. The cross is between CC BB (homogrephic red) and cc bb (plain brown). So the F1 would all be Cc Bb. When they self-fertilize, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 distribution, but let's calculate the exact counts.\n\nTotal number of offspring = 4^2 = 16 (but in reality, it's 3^2=9 possibilities per trait, but combined into 16).\n\nWait, no, more accurately, for each gene, the possible gametes are C and c for gene C (each with 50% frequency), and B and b for gene B (each with 50% frequency). So the F2 dihybrid would have 9 possible combinations for the C and B genes, but arranged across all four phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Punnett square approach would help. Let me try that.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nBut wait, in F1, all are Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, no, that's incorrect because CC BB is homozygous, and cc bb is homozygous recessive. So the F1 would be Cc Bb, each bird having one allele from each parent.\n\nThen, when F1 (Cc Bb) fly to F2, each bird will produce gametes:\n\nFor gene C: 50% C, 50% c.\n\nFor gene B: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nThus, the F2 dihybrid would have 9 possible combinations:\n\n- CB: Cc Bb\n- Cb: Cc Bb\n- cB: Cc Bb\n- cb: Cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 will have all possible combinations where each gene is independently inherited with 50% chance.\n\nWait, perhaps better to list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nGene C: CC, Cc, cc\n\nGene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nCombining these, the four phenotypes are as before.\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in F2 would be:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n\n- CC Bb: 1/16\n\n- cc BB: 1/16\n\n- cc Bb: 1/16\n\nSo each phenotype is 25% of the population.\n\nHowever, the user\u2019s options don\u2019t reflect this perfectly. Looking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests that checkered red is less common than expected.\n\nHmm, why would checkered red be fewer? Maybe because the phenotype is defined differently. Perhaps \"checkered red\" refers to having at least one C, regardless of B. But no, the initial description seems clear: checkered is when you have both C and c, but the color depends on B.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me reread it carefully.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- Dominant gene C controls the checkered pattern.\n\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\n- Red color is determined by dominant gene B.\n\n- Brown color is determined by recessive allele b.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by both C and B. Thus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (Cc BB)\n\n2. Checkered Brown (Cc Bb)\n\n3. Plain Red (cc BB)\n\n4. Plain Brown (cc Bb)\n\nNow, in the F2 generation, each of these phenotypes would occur with equal frequency, i.e., 25%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's about animal crosses and Punnett squares, which I remember from my biology class. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions four traits: color and dominance. There are two genes involved here\u2014gene C for checking or not, and gene B for red or brown. So each bird has two alleles for these genes. \n\nThe setup says that the dominant gene C controls the checkered pattern, meaning that if someone has at least one C allele, they'll have a checkered pattern. The recessive allele c means no checkered. Then, gene B determines color: a dominant B means red, and a recessive b means brown. So combining these, we get different phenotypes based on both genes.\n\nNow, there's an adhybridcross between two birds: one is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is plain brown (cc bb). Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So for the first parent, since they're red, their genotype must be CC BB because they can't be anything else without another B allele. Wait, but wait\u2014no, actually, if they're red, they have at least one B, right? But being homozygous would mean both are B. So CC BB makes sense. Similarly, the second parent is plain brown, so their genotype is cc bb, meaning both are b for the B gene.\n\nWhen they mate, the offspring will have combinations of these alleles. Since it's a cross of CC BB and cc bb, all the offspring should be Cc Bb because they inherit one allele from each parent. That's the F1 generation.\n\nBut the question isn't just about the F1\u2014it goes up to the F2 generation. So I need to consider what happens when F1 flies produce gametes, and then those gametes form F2 pairs.\n\nLooking at the options provided, A through H, each gives a different phenotypic ratio. My task is to determine which one is correct.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I'll outline the possible genotypes in the F1. Each parent contributes either C or c for gene C, and B or b for gene B. So the F1 can have four types:\n\n- Cc for gene C,\n- Bb for gene B.\n\nSo the F1 individuals will be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, each F1 bird will have one C and one c allele for gene C, and one B and one b allele for gene B. So their genotypes are Cc Bb.\n\nNow, when they mate (to get F2), each bird will produce gametes that are combinations of their alleles. For gene C, the parents are CC (which produces C gametes) and cc (which produces c gametes). So the F2 will have a 50% chance of passing C and 50% of c.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B, the parents are BB (produces B gametes) and bb (produces b gametes). So the F2 for gene B will also have a 50% chance of passing B and 50% of b.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the F2 dihybrid will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the phenotypes. But let's verify this with the actual letters.\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but I think the way the letters combine is that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So each combination will result in a specific phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the counts for each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nAdding them up, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so the total would be 25% each. However, looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that the bird is described as \"checkered\" when both C and c are present. Hmm, but no\u2014the term \"checkered\" might refer to the overall pattern, regardless of whether it's red or brown. So perhaps \"checkered red\" refers to having the C allele, regardless of the B. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Dominant gene C controls the checkered pattern.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Red color is determined by dominant gene B.\n- Brown by recessive allele b.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB (since C is present, and B is present)\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb\n- Plain Red: cc BB\n- Plain Brown: cc Bb\n\nEach of these has a probability of 25%, assuming independent assortment. But some of these might overlap in terms of phenotype description. Wait, no, each phenotype is distinct based on the presence of C and B.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user mentioned the phenotypic ratio for F2 as option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that doesn't add up. If each phenotype is 25%, across the entire population, then each should be roughly equal. But in F2, the numbers may vary slightly due to genetic laws.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial cross. The cross is between CC BB (homogrephic red) and cc bb (plain brown). So the F1 would all be Cc Bb. When they self-fertilize, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 distribution, but let's calculate the exact counts.\n\nTotal number of offspring = 4^2 = 16 (but in reality, it's 3^2=9 possibilities per trait, but combined into 16).\n\nWait, no, more accurately, for each gene, the possible gametes are C and c for gene C (each with 50% frequency), and B and b for gene B (each with 50% frequency). So the F2 dihybrid would have 9 possible combinations for the C and B genes, but arranged across all four phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Punnett square approach would help. Let me try that.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nBut wait, in F1, all are Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, no, that's incorrect because CC BB is homozygous, and cc bb is homozygous recessive. So the F1 would be Cc Bb, each bird having one allele from each parent.\n\nThen, when F1 (Cc Bb) fly to F2, each bird will produce gametes:\n\nFor gene C: 50% C, 50% c.\n\nFor gene B: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nThus, the F2 dihybrid would have 9 possible combinations:\n\n- CB: Cc Bb\n- Cb: Cc Bb\n- cB: Cc Bb\n- cb: Cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 will have all possible combinations where each gene is independently inherited with 50% chance.\n\nWait, perhaps better to list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nGene C: CC, Cc, cc\n\nGene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nCombining these, the four phenotypes are as before.\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in F2 would be:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n\n- CC Bb: 1/16\n\n- cc BB: 1/16\n\n- cc Bb: 1/16\n\nSo each phenotype is 25% of the population.\n\nHowever, the user\u2019s options don\u2019t reflect this perfectly. Looking at the options, let's see:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests that checkered red is less common than expected.\n\nHmm, why would checkered red be fewer? Maybe because the phenotype is defined differently. Perhaps \"checkered red\" refers to having at least one C, regardless of B. But no, the initial description seems clear: checkered is when you have both C and c, but the color depends on B.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me reread it carefully.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- Dominant gene C controls the checkered pattern.\n\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\n- Red color is determined by dominant gene B.\n\n- Brown color is determined by recessive allele b.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by both C and B. Thus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (Cc BB)\n\n2. Checkered Brown (Cc Bb)\n\n3. Plain Red (cc BB)\n\n4. Plain Brown (cc Bb)\n\nNow, in the F2 generation, each of these phenotypes would occur with equal frequency, i.e., 25%. However, the options given don't all have 25%.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, etc.\u2014unlikely, as each should be around 25%\n\nB. 8 checkered red, etc.\u2014this is higher than 25%, which seems unlikely\n\nC. 9 checkered red, etc.\u2014again, too high\n\nD. 1 checkered red, others more\u2014doesn't fit\n\nE. 3 checkered red, etc.\u2014less than 25%\n\nF. All equally likely\u2014this matches our expectation\n\nG. 12 checkered red, etc.\u2014too high\n\nH. 5 checkered red, etc.\u2014still high\n\nI. 7 checkered red, etc.\u2014higher than 25%\n\nJ. 2 checkered red, etc.\u2014lower than 25%\n\nK. 4 checkered red, etc.\u2014half of expected\n\nL. 3 plain red, etc.\u2014even lower\n\nM. 4 plain red, etc.\u2014also lower\n\nN. 2 plain red, etc.\u2014also lower\n\nO. 1 plain red, etc.\u2014lowest\n\nFrom the options provided, the closest to equal distribution is option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Each is 25% of the population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "rollout": " Let me start by breaking it down.\n\nThe problem involves two birds: one that's a dominant trait (checkered red) and another that's recessive (plain brown). The traits are determined by genes C and B respectively. So, the first thing I need to understand is how these genes interact in terms of inheritance.\n\nFirst, let's look at the parents involved. One bird is homozygously checkered red, which means its genotype must be CC BB because the dominant trait is expressed when both alleles are present. The other parent is a plain brown bird, meaning their genotype is cc bb. Since they're both homozygous for the recessive traits, all their offspring will inherit those, making them plain brown.\n\nNow, we're considering an adihybridcross between these two birds. Wait, adihybrid refers to crossing two different parents, right? But here, both parents are homozygous. That might mean we're talking about a self-pollination or maybe a dihybrid cross between these two.\n\nWait, no, the user mentioned a dihybrid cross, but the parents aren't both dihybrids. They're both homozygous. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between a heterozygote and another type. Hmm.\n\nBut looking back at the user's message, they provided a Punnett square setup:\n\nThe father is CCBB, and the mother is ccbb.\n\nGametes from the father would be CB and cb.\n\nFrom the mother, gametes would be cB and cb.\n\nSo, when crossed, each parent produces four types of gametes. Combining them gives F1 as CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, and ccbb. Wait, but the user then says F1 \u00d7 F1, so the F2 would come from F1 selfing.\n\nLet me get the correct steps.\n\n1. Determine the possible gamete types from each parent.\n   - Father: CCBB \u2192 can produce CB and cb (since he has two dominant alleles).\n   - Mother: ccbb \u2192 can produce cB and cb (since she has two recessive alleles).\n\n2. Create the Punnett square:\n   - Each gamete from the father combines with each gamete from the mother.\n\nSo, the combinations would be:\n- CB \u00d7 cB = CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Ccbb\n- cb \u00d7 cB = ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nSo the F1 generation has four types: CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb.\n\nNext, F1 \u00d7 F1 results in F2. So, the F2 genotypes would be the combination of F1 parents' gametes.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the answer choices include various F2 genotypes like CcBb, ccBb, etc., along with specific phenotypic ratios.\n\nBut wait, the question also asks about phenotypic ratios, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2. Also, there's an option H where the phenotype ratio is checkered red 5, brown 3, red 2, and brown 6.\n\nHmm, but I think I should focus on the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the parents given. Let's see.\n\nEach bird has two genes: C (dominant) and B (dominant). The phenotypes depend on their genotypes.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Checkered (red)\n- cc \u2192 Plain (brown)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n- bb \u2192 Plain (red)\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Because the problem states \"red\" and \"brown\" for each gene independently. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait no, actually, the way the problem is phrased is probably that the dominant alleles give the same phenotype. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C or B, it will exhibit the corresponding color.\n\nWait, but let me read again: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant, c is recessive. So, any presence of C means red, and c means plain.\n\nSimilarly, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. If B is dominant, then any B allele makes it brown, and b makes it plain. But earlier, C is dominant for red. So, the same bird could have both C and B as dominant, leading to red-brown coloration.\n\nWait, but that's not typical in genetics, usually each gene affects a different trait. But the problem says both genes contribute to color. So, a bird that has at least one dominant allele (either C or B) will display the color associated with that gene. So, C is red, B is brown. Therefore, any bird with C or B will be red or brown respectively.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because a bird can't be both red and brown unless one of the genes allows for dual expression. Or perhaps the problem is that each bird has two separate traits, so the color depends on whether they have C or B.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider that each bird's color is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for either gene. So, a bird will be red if it has at least one dominant C or one dominant B. But since C and B are independent, some birds may have both, others just one.\n\nWait, but the problem statement isn't clear. It says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, maybe the pattern is controlled by C, and the color is controlled by B. So, the same bird could have both patterns and colors, depending on the alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird has two separate traits: one determined by C (pattern) and one by B (color). So, the pattern is checkedered if the C allele is present, else plain. Similarly, the color is red if B is present, else brown.\n\nIn that case, the possible genotypes for each trait would be:\n\nPattern (C):\n- CC \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nColor (B):\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Plain\n\nBut since both traits are influenced by the same bird, the presence of at least one dominant allele for either trait determines the phenotype.\n\nTherefore, a bird with at least one dominant C (Checkered) or at least one dominant B (Brown) will exhibit the corresponding color.\n\nWait, but that might result in a bird being both Checkered and Brown, which is impossible unless one of the genes overrides the other.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the intended interpretation is that the color is determined by whichever gene is present. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, regardless of B, it will be Checkered. If it has at least one dominant allele for B, regardless of C, it will be Brown.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (if has C)\n- Brown (if has B)\n- Both (if has neither, but that's rare)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the dominant C controls red, and the recessive c controls plain. Similarly, the dominant B controls brown, and the recessive b controls plain. But the user wrote: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nThat seems contradictory because a bird can't be both red and brown. So, perhaps the problem is that each bird's color is determined by the presence of either gene, but the actual color is determined by one of them. Or perhaps the dominant alleles for both genes lead to a particular phenotype, while recessive ones lead to another.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this by considering the possible phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAssuming that having at least one dominant allele for either gene results in the respective color, but dominance is such that one gene takes precedence over the other. However, without specific information on dominance hierarchy, it's safer to assume that the dominant allele for each gene independently determines the phenotype.\n\nWait, but that would mean a bird could potentially have both C and B dominant, resulting in red and brown simultaneously, which is impossible. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the color is determined by whichever gene is present. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant C, it's Checkered; if it has at least one dominant B, it's Brown. So, a bird can only be Checkered, Brown, or Neither, but not both.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed under the assumption that the color is determined by whichever gene is present. So, if a bird has C, it's Checkered; if it has B, it's Brown. So, a bird could be both Checkered and Brown, but that's impossible, so perhaps the problem considers only one trait per bird, but that contradicts the initial description.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again carefully:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, now I see that both C and B are dominant for their respective traits. So, a bird could have both C and B dominant, leading to both Checkered and Brown. But that's unlikely, so perhaps the problem assumes that the dominant allele for each trait acts on one aspect, but doesn't necessarily override the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each bird has two traits, and the color is determined by the presence of either dominant allele. So, a bird will be Checkered if it has at least one dominant C, and Brown if it has at least one dominant B.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (has C)\n- Brown (has B)\n- Both? Well, if a bird has both, it would still be considered as Checkered, since C is dominant.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. If a bird has both C and B dominant, it's still Checkered because C is dominant. So, the presence of C will override the presence of B in determining the phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes would be:\n- Checkered (if has C)\n- Brown (if has B, even though C is dominant)\n\nSo, a bird with C would be Checkered, regardless of B. A bird with B would be Brown, regardless of C.\n\nNow, let's map this to the possible genotypes and phenotypes.\n\nFor C:\n- CC \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor B:\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Plain\n\nBut since C is dominant, any bird with C will be Checkered, and any bird with B will be Brown. So, a bird can be Checkered, Brown, or both? No, because Checkered comes from C, which is dominant. So, a bird cannot be both Checkered and Brown. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has C or B.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (has C)\n- Brown (has B)\n\nBecause having C overrides B.\n\nNow, let's determine the probabilities.\n\nThe probability of having C is determined by the father's genotype. The father is CCBB, so he contributes C and B.\n\nThe mother is ccbb, so she contributes c and b.\n\nWhen the father and mother mate, their offspring will have the following possible gametes:\n\nFather's gametes: CB (25%), cb (25%)\nMother's gametes: cb (25%)\n\nSo, the F1 generation will consist of:\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The father can produce CB and cb, and the mother can produce cb.\n\nSo, the F1 genotypes are:\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but the father's gametes are CB and cb, and the mother's are cb. So, the F1 genotypes are:\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (probability 25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb (probability 25%)\n\nWait, but the father can produce CB and cb, and the mother can produce cb. So, the F1 is:\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but the father's gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So, half the time, the father contributes CB, and half the time, cb.\n\nThen, the mother always contributes cb.\n\nSo, combining:\n- Half of the time: CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25% of total)\n- Half of the time: cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25% of total)\n\nSo, F1 genotypes:\n- CcBb (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n- CcBb: Since C is dominant, it's Checkered (C), and B is present, so Brown. Wait, but does B matter? Since C is dominant, B doesn't affect the phenotype because C already determines it. So, CcBb \u2192 Checkered (since C is present), and Brown (because B is present, but since C is dominant, it's already Checkered. Wait, no\u2014wait, the color is determined by either C or B. If C is present, it's Checkered, regardless of B. So, CcBb \u2192 Checkered, Brown.\n\nccbb: Both C and B are absent \u2192 Plain.\n\nSo, the F1 phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (25%)\n- Brown (25%)\n- Plain (50%)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in reality, the F1 would have a certain distribution based on their parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nThe father is CCBB \u2192 so his gametes are CB and cb (each 50%).\n\nThe mother is ccbb \u2192 her gametes are cb (100%).\n\nSo, the F1 is:\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nSo, F1 genotypes:\n- CcBb (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n- CcBb: Checkered (because C is present), Brown (because B is present, but since C is dominant, it's already Checkered)\n- ccbb: Plain\n\nSo, phenotypically:\n- Checkered (25%)\n- Brown (25%)\n- Plain (50%)\n\nBut wait, in reality, if a bird has C, it's Checkered, and if it has B, it's Brown. So, a bird can't be both Checkered and Brown. So, the phenotypes are determined solely by whether it has C or B.\n\nTherefore, the F1 phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (if has C) \u2192 25%\n- Brown (if has B) \u2192 25%\n- Plain (if has neither) \u2192 50%\n\nNow, moving forward to F2, which is the result of F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nThe F1 genotypes are CcBb and ccbb.\n\nSo, when F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n- CcBb \u2192 can produce CcBb, Ccbb, cCBb, ccbb (but wait, let's clarify: CcBb can produce gametes CB, Cb, cB, cb)\nSimilarly, ccbb can produce only cb.\n\nSo, F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce:\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb: Produces gametes as above\n- CcBb \u00d7 ccbb: Produces only cb gametes\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will be a combination of these.\n\nBut instead of going through all combinations, perhaps we can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the probabilities using the rules of Mendelian inheritance.\n\nLet's break it down into two independent traits (C and B) and calculate the probabilities separately, then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parental genotype: Cc (from F1)\n- Probability of producing C gamete: 50%\n- Probability of producing c gamete: 50%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Parental genotype: Bb (from F1)\n- Probability of producing B gamete: 50%\n- Probability of producing b gamete: 50%\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nSo, the possible gametes for each parent are CB, Cb, cB, cb, each with 25% probability.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb) are crossed:\n\nWe can model this as:\n\nGametes from first F1: CB (25%), Cb (25%), cB (25%), cb (25%)\nGametes from second F1: same as above.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypes, we need to consider all possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\nBut since the two loci are independent, the probability of each combination is (probability of C gamete) * (probability of B gamete).\n\nSo, the probability of a particular genotype is the product of the probabilities of each allele.\n\nFor example:\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb (probability 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- CB \u00d7 Cb = CcBB (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\nWait, no, that's incorrect because each parent's gamete is independent.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Each parent produces gametes with a certain probability, so the F2 will have combinations of these gametes.\n\nBut to simplify, since each locus is independent, the overall probabilities for the F2 genotypes can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, for the C locus:\n- CC: 25% (from C \u00d7 C)\n- Cc: 50% (from C \u00d7 c)\n- cc: 25% (from c \u00d7 c)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: 25% (from B \u00d7 B)\n- Bb: 50% (from B \u00d7 b)\n- bb: 25% (from b \u00d7 b)\n\nNow, to find the combined probabilities for each F2 genotype, multiply the probabilities of each allele.\n\nFor example:\n- CC (C from each parent): 25% (C)",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by breaking it down.\n\nThe problem involves two birds: one that's a dominant trait (checkered red) and another that's recessive (plain brown). The traits are determined by genes C and B respectively. So, the first thing I need to understand is how these genes interact in terms of inheritance.\n\nFirst, let's look at the parents involved. One bird is homozygously checkered red, which means its genotype must be CC BB because the dominant trait is expressed when both alleles are present. The other parent is a plain brown bird, meaning their genotype is cc bb. Since they're both homozygous for the recessive traits, all their offspring will inherit those, making them plain brown.\n\nNow, we're considering an adihybridcross between these two birds.

That might mean we're talking about a self-pollination or maybe a dihybrid cross between these two.\n\nWait, no, the user mentioned a dihybrid cross, but the parents aren't both dihybrids. They're both homozygous. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between a heterozygote and another type. Hmm.\n\nBut looking back at the user's message, they provided a Punnett square setup:\n\nThe father is CCBB, and the mother is ccbb.\n\nGametes from the father would be CB and cb.\n\nFrom the mother, gametes would be cB and cb.\n\nSo, when crossed, each parent produces four types of gametes. Combining them gives F1 as CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, and ccbb. Wait, but the user then says F1 \u00d7 F1, so the F2 would come from F1 selfing.\n\nLet me get the correct steps.\n\n1. Determine the possible gamete types from each parent.\n   - Father: CCBB \u2192 can produce CB and cb (since he has two dominant alleles).\n   - Mother: ccbb \u2192 can produce cB and cb (since she has two recessive alleles).\n\n2. Create the Punnett square:\n   - Each gamete from the father combines with each gamete from the mother.\n\nSo, the combinations would be:\n- CB \u00d7 cB = CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Ccbb\n- cb \u00d7 cB = ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nSo the F1 generation has four types: CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb.\n\nNext, F1 \u00d7 F1 results in F2. So, the F2 genotypes would be the combination of F1 parents' gametes.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the answer choices include various F2 genotypes like CcBb, ccBb, etc., along with specific phenotypic ratios.\n\nBut wait, the question also asks about phenotypic ratios, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2. Also, there's an option H where the phenotype ratio is checkered red 5, brown 3, red 2, and brown 6.\n\nHmm, but I think I should focus on the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the parents given. Let's see.\n\nEach bird has two genes: C (dominant) and B (dominant). The phenotypes depend on their genotypes.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Checkered (red)\n- cc \u2192 Plain (brown)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB or Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n- bb \u2192 Plain (red)\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Because the problem states \"red\" and \"brown\" for each gene independently. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait no, actually, the way the problem is phrased is probably that the dominant alleles give the same phenotype. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C or B, it will exhibit the corresponding color.\n\nWait, but let me read again: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant, c is recessive. So, any presence of C means red, and c means plain.\n\nSimilarly, \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. If B is dominant, then any B allele makes it brown, and b makes it plain. But earlier, C is dominant for red. So, the same bird could have both C and B as dominant, leading to red-brown coloration.\n\nWait, but that's not typical in genetics, usually each gene affects a different trait. But the problem says both genes contribute to color. So, a bird that has at least one dominant allele (either C or B) will display the color associated with that gene. So, C is red, B is brown. Therefore, any bird with C or B will be red or brown respectively.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because a bird can't be both red and brown unless one of the genes allows for dual expression. Or perhaps the problem is that each bird has two separate traits, so the color depends on whether they have C or B.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's consider that each bird's color is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for either gene. So, a bird will be red if it has at least one dominant C or one dominant B. But since C and B are independent, some birds may have both, others just one.\n\nWait, but the problem statement isn't clear. It says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, maybe the pattern is controlled by C, and the color is controlled by B. So, the same bird could have both patterns and colors, depending on the alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird has two separate traits: one determined by C (pattern) and one by B (color). So, the pattern is checkedered if the C allele is present, else plain. Similarly, the color is red if B is present, else brown.\n\nIn that case, the possible genotypes for each trait would be:\n\nPattern (C):\n- CC \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nColor (B):\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Plain\n\nBut since both traits are influenced by the same bird, the presence of at least one dominant allele for either trait determines the phenotype.\n\nTherefore, a bird with at least one dominant C (Checkered) or at least one dominant B (Brown) will exhibit the corresponding color.\n\nWait, but that might result in a bird being both Checkered and Brown, which is impossible unless one of the genes overrides the other.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the intended interpretation is that the color is determined by whichever gene is present. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, regardless of B, it will be Checkered. If it has at least one dominant allele for B, regardless of C, it will be Brown.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (if has C)\n- Brown (if has B)\n- Both (if has neither, but that's rare)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the dominant C controls red, and the recessive c controls plain. Similarly, the dominant B controls brown, and the recessive b controls plain. But the user wrote: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nThat seems contradictory because a bird can't be both red and brown. So, perhaps the problem is that each bird's color is determined by the presence of either gene, but the actual color is determined by one of them. Or perhaps the dominant alleles for both genes lead to a particular phenotype, while recessive ones lead to another.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this by considering the possible phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAssuming that having at least one dominant allele for either gene results in the respective color, but dominance is such that one gene takes precedence over the other. However, without specific information on dominance hierarchy, it's safer to assume that the dominant allele for each gene independently determines the phenotype.\n\nWait, but that would mean a bird could potentially have both C and B dominant, resulting in red and brown simultaneously, which is impossible. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the color is determined by whichever gene is present. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant C, it's Checkered; if it has at least one dominant B, it's Brown. So, a bird can only be Checkered, Brown, or Neither, but not both.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed under the assumption that the color is determined by whichever gene is present. So, if a bird has C, it's Checkered; if it has B, it's Brown. So, a bird could be both Checkered and Brown, but that's impossible, so perhaps the problem considers only one trait per bird, but that contradicts the initial description.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again carefully:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, now I see that both C and B are dominant for their respective traits. So, a bird could have both C and B dominant, leading to both Checkered and Brown. But that's unlikely, so perhaps the problem assumes that the dominant allele for each trait acts on one aspect, but doesn't necessarily override the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each bird has two traits, and the color is determined by the presence of either dominant allele. So, a bird will be Checkered if it has at least one dominant C, and Brown if it has at least one dominant B.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (has C)\n- Brown (has B)\n- Both? Well, if a bird has both, it would still be considered as Checkered, since C is dominant.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. If a bird has both C and B dominant, it's still Checkered because C is dominant. So, the presence of C will override the presence of B in determining the phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes would be:\n- Checkered (if has C)\n- Brown (if has B, even though C is dominant)\n\nSo, a bird with C would be Checkered, regardless of B. A bird with B would be Brown, regardless of C.\n\nNow, let's map this to the possible genotypes and phenotypes.\n\nFor C:\n- CC \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor B:\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Plain\n\nBut since C is dominant, any bird with C will be Checkered, and any bird with B will be Brown. So, a bird can be Checkered, Brown, or both? No, because Checkered comes from C, which is dominant. So, a bird cannot be both Checkered and Brown. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has C or B.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (has C)\n- Brown (has B)\n\nBecause having C overrides B.\n\nNow, let's determine the probabilities.\n\nThe probability of having C is determined by the father's genotype. The father is CCBB, so he contributes C and B.\n\nThe mother is ccbb, so she contributes c and b.\n\nWhen the father and mother mate, their offspring will have the following possible gametes:\n\nFather's gametes: CB (25%), cb (25%)\nMother's gametes: cb (25%)\n\nSo, the F1 generation will consist of:\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The father can produce CB and cb, and the mother can produce cb.\n\nSo, the F1 genotypes are:\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but the father's gametes are CB and cb, and the mother's are cb. So, the F1 genotypes are:\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (probability 25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb (probability 25%)\n\nWait, but the father can produce CB and cb, and the mother can produce cb. So, the F1 is:\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but the father's gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So, half the time, the father contributes CB, and half the time, cb.\n\nThen, the mother always contributes cb.\n\nSo, combining:\n- Half of the time: CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25% of total)\n- Half of the time: cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25% of total)\n\nSo, F1 genotypes:\n- CcBb (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n- CcBb: Since C is dominant, it's Checkered (C), and B is present, so Brown. Wait, but does B matter? Since C is dominant, B doesn't affect the phenotype because C already determines it. So, CcBb \u2192 Checkered (since C is present), and Brown (because B is present, but since C is dominant, it's already Checkered. Wait, no\u2014wait, the color is determined by either C or B. If C is present, it's Checkered, regardless of B. So, CcBb \u2192 Checkered, Brown.\n\nccbb: Both C and B are absent \u2192 Plain.\n\nSo, the F1 phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (25%)\n- Brown (25%)\n- Plain (50%)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in reality, the F1 would have a certain distribution based on their parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nThe father is CCBB \u2192 so his gametes are CB and cb (each 50%).\n\nThe mother is ccbb \u2192 her gametes are cb (100%).\n\nSo, the F1 is:\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nSo, F1 genotypes:\n- CcBb (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n- CcBb: Checkered (because C is present), Brown (because B is present, but since C is dominant, it's already Checkered)\n- ccbb: Plain\n\nSo, phenotypically:\n- Checkered (25%)\n- Brown (25%)\n- Plain (50%)\n\nBut wait, in reality, if a bird has C, it's Checkered, and if it has B, it's Brown. So, a bird can't be both Checkered and Brown. So, the phenotypes are determined solely by whether it has C or B.\n\nTherefore, the F1 phenotypes are:\n- Checkered (if has C) \u2192 25%\n- Brown (if has B) \u2192 25%\n- Plain (if has neither) \u2192 50%\n\nNow, moving forward to F2, which is the result of F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nThe F1 genotypes are CcBb and ccbb.\n\nSo, when F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n- CcBb \u2192 can produce CcBb, Ccbb, cCBb, ccbb (but wait, let's clarify: CcBb can produce gametes CB, Cb, cB, cb)\nSimilarly, ccbb can produce only cb.\n\nSo, F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce:\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb: Produces gametes as above\n- CcBb \u00d7 ccbb: Produces only cb gametes\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will be a combination of these.\n\nBut instead of going through all combinations, perhaps we can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the probabilities using the rules of Mendelian inheritance.\n\nLet's break it down into two independent traits (C and B) and calculate the probabilities separately, then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parental genotype: Cc (from F1)\n- Probability of producing C gamete: 50%\n- Probability of producing c gamete: 50%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Parental genotype: Bb (from F1)\n- Probability of producing B gamete: 50%\n- Probability of producing b gamete: 50%\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nSo, the possible gametes for each parent are CB, Cb, cB, cb, each with 25% probability.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb) are crossed:\n\nWe can model this as:\n\nGametes from first F1: CB (25%), Cb (25%), cB (25%), cb (25%)\nGametes from second F1: same as above.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypes, we need to consider all possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\nBut since the two loci are independent, the probability of each combination is (probability of C gamete) * (probability of B gamete).\n\nSo, the probability of a particular genotype is the product of the probabilities of each allele.\n\nFor example:\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb (probability 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- CB \u00d7 Cb = CcBB (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\nWait, no, that's incorrect because each parent's gamete is independent.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Each parent produces gametes with a certain probability, so the F2 will have combinations of these gametes.\n\nBut to simplify, since each locus is independent, the overall probabilities for the F2 genotypes can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, for the C locus:\n- CC: 25% (from C \u00d7 C)\n- Cc: 50% (from C \u00d7 c)\n- cc: 25% (from c \u00d7 c)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: 25% (from B \u00d7 B)\n- Bb: 50% (from B \u00d7 b)\n- bb: 25% (from b \u00d7 b)\n\nNow, to find the combined probabilities for each F2 genotype, multiply the probabilities of each allele.\n\nFor example:\n- CC (C from each parent): 25% (C)",

    "chunk_resampled": "Let's break it down step by step.",
    "rollout": " Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem describes a checkered pattern in a pigeon population controlled by a dominant gene C. That means if an animal has at least one C allele, they'll have the checkered pattern, right? And the other phenotype would be plain, which requires two c alleles because c is recessive.\n\nThen there are color genes involved too. Red is controlled by gene B, and brown by gene b. So, if someone has at least one B allele, their feathers will be red, and if they have at least one b, they'll be brown. But wait, how do these colors interact? Oh, right, the dominant B takes precedence over b, so any presence of B makes them red, regardless of b.\n\nNow, the cross described is between two birds: one is a checkered red bird (which must be CC BB since checkered is C and red is B), and the other is plain brown (cc bb). So, let's write that as parents: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nThe goal is to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross, but actually, the cross here isn't adihybrid\u2014it\u2019s between two specific birds. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" Hmm, maybe I misread it earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back: the user provided a list of possible answers, A through I, each giving a different phenotypic ratio. The initial prompt seems to present a detailed process, including creating gametes, forming the F1, then the F2. But perhaps the key is to focus on the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents given.\n\nSo, the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nWe need to find the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotype of the offspring from these parents.\n2. Figure out the phenotypes based on the genotypes.\n3. Calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation.\n4. Convert that into phenotypic ratios.\n\nStarting with the parents: CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWhen you cross these two, each parent will produce four types of gametes. Since both parents are homozygous, all gametes will be the same as their own alleles.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes with CB or BB? Wait, no\u2014wait, the notation might be confusing. Each parent is homozygous for both genes, so for each gene, they have two identical alleles.\n\nWait, the notation should represent each locus separately. So, for the first gene (C and c), Parent 1 is CC, so they can only produce gametes with C. For the second gene (B and b), Parent 1 is BB, so they can only produce gametes with B. Therefore, all gametes from Parent 1 are CB.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes with c and b, respectively, so all gametes are cb.\n\nTherefore, when these two parents mate, the F1 will get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the C/c locus, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 for the B/b locus. So, each F1 individual will have the genotype Cc and Bb, resulting in checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant).\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that doesn't seem right because the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, not between different combinations. Wait, no\u2014if both parents contribute C and c alleles for the C locus, and B and b alleles for the B locus, then the F1 will be Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nBut the question mentions an adihybrid cross, which typically involves two different traits being crossed. Maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about F2 generation based on the parents given, without necessarily performing an adihybrid cross.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: It asks to complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, for the F2 generation, provide the phenotypic ratio.\n\nSo, probably, the parents are homozygous: one is checkered red (homozygous CC BB), and the other is plain brown (homozygous cc bb). Their cross would result in F1 individuals all being Cc Bb (checkered red), and then F2 would involve another crossing of F1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation after considering the parents given, without specifying an adihybrid cross, but rather just the F2 from the parents.\n\nWait, the wording is: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nAh, okay, so the parents are:\n\n- Homozygous checkered red: CC BB\n- Heterozygous plain brown: cc bb\n\nAnd we're supposed to perform an adihybrid cross between these two parents. Adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits, like height and flower color. In this case, the two loci are C and c, and B and b.\n\nSo, the cross would be between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1 that are Cc Bb (checkered red). Then, F1s would self-pollinate (adihybrid cross), leading to F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the question also mentions F2, so perhaps it's referring to the F2 generation after the cross. Alternatively, maybe it's about the phenotypic ratios observed in F2 under certain conditions.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm complicating it more than necessary. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown)\n\nCross: Parent 1 x Parent 2 \u2192 F1\n\nEach F1 will be Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nThen, F1s self-pollinate (adihybrid cross) \u2192 F2.\n\nIn F2, we calculate the genotypic distribution and then map it to phenotypes.\n\nFor the adihybrid cross (F1 x F1):\n\nEach F1 individual is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen F1s mate, the possible gametes from each locus are independent.\n\nFor the C locus: C can produce C or c (from CC and cc).\nFor the B locus: B can produce B or b (from BB and bb).\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the Punnett square for F1 x F1 will have:\n\n- Cc for the C locus,\n- Bb for the B locus,\n\nresulting in the F2 genotype being Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of CC = 25%,\n- Probability of Cc = 50%,\n- Probability of cc = 25%.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of BB = 25%,\n- Probability of Bb = 50%,\n- Probability of bb = 25%.\n\nSince the genes are linked (as per typical genetic linkage), the alleles may not assort independently. However, the problem doesn't specify whether the loci are linked or not. If they are linked, we'd have to consider recombination frequencies, but since the options don't mention that, and the question seems to suggest simple Mendelian inheritance, perhaps we can assume independent assortment.\n\nUnder independent assortment, the probability for each combination is 25%, except where recombinants occur. But without recombination data, we proceed with 25% each.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypic ratios are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, that sums up to 100%. Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Checkered (C): Dominant allele for color.\n   - Red (R): Dominant allele for B.\n   - Brown (r): Recessive for B.\n\nSo, any bird with at least one C (for color) and at least one B (for red) will be checkered red.\n\nIf a bird has C (anywhere) and r (for brown), it's checkered brown.\n\nIf it has c (for color) but B, it's plain red.\n\nIf it has c and r, it's plain brown.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes' phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 genotypes, each contributing to a phenotype. Assuming equal phenotypic expression among genotypes, each contributes equally. Similarly for the others.\n\nWait, but the question is about phenotypic ratios, not genotypic. So, let's see:\n\nNumber of Checkered red:\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 1\nTotal: 3\n\nCheckered brown:\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc bb: 1\nTotal: 2\n\nPlain red:\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\nTotal: 2\n\nPlain brown:\n- cc bb: 1\nTotal: 1\n\nSo, total phenotypes: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nWait, but the options provided go up to 12. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, no, I think I did. Because in reality, the actual number depends on the dominance hierarchy. For example, if the presence of B allows for dominance over b, but the presence of C allows for dominance over c, etc., the phenotypic ratios could vary depending on whether some genotypes are indistinct.\n\nWait, but in this case, the parents are all heterozygous for both genes (Cc Bb), and the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations. So, unless there's any linkage affecting the segregation, the phenotypic ratio would follow the usual Mendelian expectations.\n\nSo, with 3 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, 2 Plain red, 1 Plain brown, the ratio is 3:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 No, that's 2:6:3:1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, in F2:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\nCheckered red: 3 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB)\nCheckered brown: 2 (CC bb, Cc bb)\nPlain red: 2 (cc BB, cc Bb)\nPlain brown: 1 (cc bb)\n\nSo, the ratio is 3:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, if a bird has at least one C, it's checkered, otherwise plain. Similarly, having at least one B makes it red, else brown.\n\nSo, a bird with C and B is checkered red.\n\nA bird with C and b is checkered brown.\n\nA bird with c and B is plain red.\n\nA bird with c and b is plain brown.\n\nNow, in F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the number of each genotype.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypic ratios:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotypic counts are:\n\nCheckered red: 3 (since three genotypes)\nCheckered brown: 2\nPlain red: 2\nPlain brown: 1\n\nSo, the ratio is 3:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this.

So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is calculated differently, taking into account the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, suppose that having at least one B results in red, and at least one c results in brown. Also, having at least one C results in checkered.\n\nBut does the presence of multiple alleles affect the phenotype? For example, if a bird is Cc and Bb, it would be checkered red because it has both C and B alleles.\n\nWait, that's what I thought before, so the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that having at least one B makes it red, and having at least one c makes it brown, regardless of color genes. So, even if a bird is Cc and Bb, it's still checkered red.\n\nSame logic applies: if a bird has C, it's checkered; if it has B, it's red; if it has c, it's brown. So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of any dominant allele for each trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios remain as 3:2:2:1.\n\nBut since none of the answer options match this, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, going back to the initial instruction: the question was about an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). The F2 generation's phenotypic ratio needs to be determined.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the F2 is derived from the F1 of the cross, not from the parents themselves. So, the F1 would be CC Bb (since parents are CC BB and cc bb, F1 is Cc Bb), and then F1 x F1 (adihybrid) would give F2.\n\nBut in that case, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nAs previously, each F1 (Cc Bb) produces gametes C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypic ratios would be 25% for each of the nine possible combinations.\n\nBut the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: Cc Bb \u2192 3 genotypes\n- Checkered brown: CC bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n- Plain red: cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n- Plain brown: cc bb \u2192 1 genotype\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:2:2:1.\n\nAgain, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio instead. Let me check.\n\nF1 would be Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nSo, all F1 are checkered red. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, but the options don't reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation's F1 as the starting point, but that's not standard.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial cross is not adihybrid but a regular dihybrid cross. The problem states: \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem refers to a dihybrid cross, not adihybrid. Adihybrid refers to two different traits being crossed, while dihybrid is crossing two traits on the same chromosome.\n\nPerhaps I got confused earlier. Let's clarify:\n\nAn adihybrid cross involves two different traits, such as height (e.g., tall vs short) and flower color (red vs white). It's often used when studying dominance relationships between two traits.\n\nIn this case, the two traits are color (B and b) and pattern (C and c). So, the adihybrid cross would be between a bird with a specific combination of B and C (like CC BB) and another bird with a specific combination of b and c (like cc bb). The F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would be the next generation.\n\nGiven that, the F2 genotypic ratios would be as I calculated earlier: 3 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, 2 Plain red, ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem describes a checkered pattern in a pigeon population controlled by a dominant gene C. That means if an animal has at least one C allele, they'll have the checkered pattern, right? And the other phenotype would be plain, which requires two c alleles because c is recessive.\n\nThen there are color genes involved too. Red is controlled by gene B, and brown by gene b. So, if someone has at least one B allele, their feathers will be red, and if they have at least one b, they'll be brown. But wait, how do these colors interact? Oh, right, the dominant B takes precedence over b, so any presence of B makes them red, regardless of b.\n\nNow, the cross described is between two birds: one is a checkered red bird (which must be CC BB since checkered is C and red is B), and the other is plain brown (cc bb). So, let's write that as parents: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nThe goal is to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross, but actually, the cross here isn't adihybrid\u2014it\u2019s between two specific birds. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" Hmm, maybe I misread it earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back: the user provided a list of possible answers, A through I, each giving a different phenotypic ratio. The initial prompt seems to present a detailed process, including creating gametes, forming the F1, then the F2. But perhaps the key is to focus on the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios based on the parents given.\n\nSo, the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nWe need to find the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotype of the offspring from these parents.\n2. Figure out the phenotypes based on the genotypes.\n3. Calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation.\n4. Convert that into phenotypic ratios.\n\nStarting with the parents: CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWhen you cross these two, each parent will produce four types of gametes. Since both parents are homozygous, all gametes will be the same as their own alleles.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes with CB or BB? Wait, no\u2014wait, the notation might be confusing. Each parent is homozygous for both genes, so for each gene, they have two identical alleles.\n\nWait, the notation should represent each locus separately. So, for the first gene (C and c), Parent 1 is CC, so they can only produce gametes with C. For the second gene (B and b), Parent 1 is BB, so they can only produce gametes with B. Therefore, all gametes from Parent 1 are CB.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes with c and b, respectively, so all gametes are cb.\n\nTherefore, when these two parents mate, the F1 will get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the C/c locus, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 for the B/b locus. So, each F1 individual will have the genotype Cc and Bb, resulting in checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant).\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that doesn't seem right because the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, not between different combinations. Wait, no\u2014if both parents contribute C and c alleles for the C locus, and B and b alleles for the B locus, then the F1 will be Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nBut the question mentions an adihybrid cross, which typically involves two different traits being crossed. Maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about F2 generation based on the parents given, without necessarily performing an adihybrid cross.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: It asks to complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, for the F2 generation, provide the phenotypic ratio.\n\nSo, probably, the parents are homozygous: one is checkered red (homozygous CC BB), and the other is plain brown (homozygous cc bb). Their cross would result in F1 individuals all being Cc Bb (checkered red), and then F2 would involve another crossing of F1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation after considering the parents given, without specifying an adihybrid cross, but rather just the F2 from the parents.\n\nWait, the wording is: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nAh, okay, so the parents are:\n\n- Homozygous checkered red: CC BB\n- Heterozygous plain brown: cc bb\n\nAnd we're supposed to perform an adihybrid cross between these two parents. Adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits, like height and flower color. In this case, the two loci are C and c, and B and b.\n\nSo, the cross would be between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1 that are Cc Bb (checkered red). Then, F1s would self-pollinate (adihybrid cross), leading to F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the question also mentions F2, so perhaps it's referring to the F2 generation after the cross. Alternatively, maybe it's about the phenotypic ratios observed in F2 under certain conditions.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm complicating it more than necessary. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous plain brown)\n\nCross: Parent 1 x Parent 2 \u2192 F1\n\nEach F1 will be Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nThen, F1s self-pollinate (adihybrid cross) \u2192 F2.\n\nIn F2, we calculate the genotypic distribution and then map it to phenotypes.\n\nFor the adihybrid cross (F1 x F1):\n\nEach F1 individual is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen F1s mate, the possible gametes from each locus are independent.\n\nFor the C locus: C can produce C or c (from CC and cc).\nFor the B locus: B can produce B or b (from BB and bb).\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the Punnett square for F1 x F1 will have:\n\n- Cc for the C locus,\n- Bb for the B locus,\n\nresulting in the F2 genotype being Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb.\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of CC = 25%,\n- Probability of Cc = 50%,\n- Probability of cc = 25%.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of BB = 25%,\n- Probability of Bb = 50%,\n- Probability of bb = 25%.\n\nSince the genes are linked (as per typical genetic linkage), the alleles may not assort independently. However, the problem doesn't specify whether the loci are linked or not. If they are linked, we'd have to consider recombination frequencies, but since the options don't mention that, and the question seems to suggest simple Mendelian inheritance, perhaps we can assume independent assortment.\n\nUnder independent assortment, the probability for each combination is 25%, except where recombinants occur. But without recombination data, we proceed with 25% each.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypic ratios are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, that sums up to 100%. Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Checkered (C): Dominant allele for color.\n   - Red (R): Dominant allele for B.\n   - Brown (r): Recessive for B.\n\nSo, any bird with at least one C (for color) and at least one B (for red) will be checkered red.\n\nIf a bird has C (anywhere) and r (for brown), it's checkered brown.\n\nIf it has c (for color) but B, it's plain red.\n\nIf it has c and r, it's plain brown.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes' phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 genotypes, each contributing to a phenotype. Assuming equal phenotypic expression among genotypes, each contributes equally. Similarly for the others.\n\nWait, but the question is about phenotypic ratios, not genotypic. So, let's see:\n\nNumber of Checkered red:\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 1\nTotal: 3\n\nCheckered brown:\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc bb: 1\nTotal: 2\n\nPlain red:\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\nTotal: 2\n\nPlain brown:\n- cc bb: 1\nTotal: 1\n\nSo, total phenotypes: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nWait, but the options provided go up to 12. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, no, I think I did. Because in reality, the actual number depends on the dominance hierarchy. For example, if the presence of B allows for dominance over b, but the presence of C allows for dominance over c, etc., the phenotypic ratios could vary depending on whether some genotypes are indistinct.\n\nWait, but in this case, the parents are all heterozygous for both genes (Cc Bb), and the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations. So, unless there's any linkage affecting the segregation, the phenotypic ratio would follow the usual Mendelian expectations.\n\nSo, with 3 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, 2 Plain red, 1 Plain brown, the ratio is 3:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 No, that's 2:6:3:1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, in F2:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\nCheckered red: 3 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB)\nCheckered brown: 2 (CC bb, Cc bb)\nPlain red: 2 (cc BB, cc Bb)\nPlain brown: 1 (cc bb)\n\nSo, the ratio is 3:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, if a bird has at least one C, it's checkered, otherwise plain. Similarly, having at least one B makes it red, else brown.\n\nSo, a bird with C and B is checkered red.\n\nA bird with C and b is checkered brown.\n\nA bird with c and B is plain red.\n\nA bird with c and b is plain brown.\n\nNow, in F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the number of each genotype.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypic ratios:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotypic counts are:\n\nCheckered red: 3 (since three genotypes)\nCheckered brown: 2\nPlain red: 2\nPlain brown: 1\n\nSo, the ratio is 3:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this.

Plain color is due to a recessive allele c. Red color is determined by a dominant gene B, and brown by the recessive allele b.\n\nWe need to complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). Then, we have to show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red = CC BB\nParent 2: Plain brown = cc bb\n\nSo each parent will produce gametes based on their genotype.\n\nFor Parent 1 (CCBB):\n- The alleles are both dominant for color (C), so they'll produce gametes with either B or b.\n- Since C is dominant, all gametes will carry at least one C, which means they're all checkered birds because the dominant trait is checkered.\n\nWait, no, actually, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So since both parents are heterozygous for color (C), all their gametes should be CB and cb. Wait, but if Parent 1 is CC BB, then they can only contribute C and B? No, wait, no\u2014the notation might be confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent's genotype:\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 They can only make gametes with CB, because both genes are dominant. So all gametes from Parent 1 are CB.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Their gametes can only be cb because both genes are recessive.\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, the possible offspring (F1) would be:\n\nParent 1 (CB) x Parent 2 (cb)\n\nSo the possible gametes are CB and cb.\n\nMixing them:\n- CB + cb = CcBb\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nBut wait, each parent produces gametes, so the F1 generation will consist of:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb:\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n\nAnd from cb \u00d7 cb:\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nWait, no, actually, when you cross two different species, the F1 would receive one gamete from each parent. So each F1 individual gets one gamete from each parent. Therefore, the F1 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom Parent 1's CB gamete and Parent 2's cb gamete:\n- CcBb\n\nFrom Parent 1's CB gamete and Parent 2's cb gamete:\n- CcBb\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each F1 bird will get one allele from each parent. So the F1 genotype will be a combination of the alleles from each parent.\n\nSince Parent 1 contributes CB (so C and B) and Parent 2 contributes cb (so c and b), the F1 will have:\n\nC (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2), making Cc for the first gene.\n\nB (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2), making Bb for the second gene.\n\nWait, no. Each parent gives one allele per gene. So for the first gene (color):\n\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\nSo F1: Cc\n\nSecond gene (size):\n\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\nSo F1: Bb\n\nTherefore, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nBut wait, when you have two genes, you can use a Punnett square.

Both alleles are recessive, so their gametes will be cb.\n\nWhen these two mated, the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CB (from Parent 1) and cb (from Parent 2): CcBb\n\nBecause:\n- First gene: C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc\n- Second gene: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Bb\n\nSo F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nSo the F2 will be based on the F1 genotypes.\n\nEach F1 bird has genotype CcBb. So when they mate, each gene segregates independently.\n\nLet's look at each gene separately.\n\nFirst gene (color):\n\nParent: Cc \u2192 can produce C and c.\n\nSecond gene (size):\n\nParent: Bb \u2192 can produce B and b.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for each gene:\n\nFor Color Gene:\n\nC | c\n---|---\nC | CC (checkered)\nc | cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for Size Gene:\n\nB | b\n---|---\nB | BB (red)\nb | bb (brown)\n\nSo combining both genes, using a four-square Punnett square:\n\nFirst gene: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc\n\nSecond gene: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nBut wait, when considering the combined effect, each bird has both color and size genes. So each bird's genotype is a combination of the two genes.\n\nSo for the F2 generation:\n\nEach bird's genotype will be a combination of one allele from the color gene and one from the size gene.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom color gene:\n\n- CC (if C from both parents)\n- Cc (if C from one and c from the other)\n- cc (if c from both)\n\nFrom size gene:\n\n- BB (if B from both)\n- Bb (if B from one and b from the other)\n- bb (if b from both)\n\nCombining both, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (C from color, B from size)\n- CC Bb (C from color, b from size)\n- CC bb (C from color, b from size)\n- Cc BB (c from color, B from size)\n- Cc Bb (c from color, b from size)\n- Cc bb (c from color, b from size)\n- cc BB (c from color, B from size)\n- cc Bb (c from color, b from size)\n- cc bb (c from color, b from size)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the alleles present. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for color (i.e., C), it's checkered.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for size (i.e., B), it's red.\n- Otherwise, it's plain for color and brown for size.\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on its genotype.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we can count how many birds fall into each category.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the probability of each genotype and then translate that into phenotype counts.\n\nGiven that the parents are both CcBb, the F2 generation will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since the genes are independent, the overall ratio will be more complex.\n\nHowever, since both genes are being considered together, the Punnett square approach is better.\n\nLet me consider the F2 genotypes.\n\nFor the color gene (Cc x Cc):\n\nProbability of CC = 25%, Cc = 50%, cc = 25%.\n\nFor the size gene (Bb x Bb):\n\nProbability of BB = 25%, Bb = 50%, bb = 25%.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nSo the overall F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: (25% color) * (25% size) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 6.25%\n- CC bb: 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 6.25%\n- Cc Bb: 6.25%\n- Cc bb: 6.25%\n- cc BB: 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 6.25%\n- cc bb: 6.25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because each gene is independent, the actual probabilities multiply.\n\nActually, for each gene, it's 25% for each outcome, so the overall probabilities for each combination are:\n\n(25% for color) * (25% for size) = 6.25% for each combination.\n\nBut since there are nine possible combinations, each with 6.25% chance.\n\nNow, converting these percentages to actual numbers, assuming a total of, say, 100 birds.\n\nEach percentage corresponds to a number. But without knowing the total number of birds, it's hard to give exact counts, but perhaps the options provided can help us infer.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, some mention specific counts like \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2,\" etc.\n\nBut perhaps instead of looking at the entire ratio, we can determine the phenotypes directly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have any dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nSo:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (for color) and at least one B (for size), it's checkered red.\n- If the bird has at least one C but no B, it's checkered brown.\n- If it has no C but at least one B, it's plain red.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it's plain brown.\n\nSo now, let's see what each F2 genotype falls into.\n\nFirst, list all F2 genotypes along with their colors and sizes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (because color is C, but size is bb \u2192 brown)\nWait, no\u2014wait, if the bird has at least one B, regardless of the size, it's red. Wait, no, the phenotype is determined as follows: if the bird has at least one dominant allele in either gene, it shows the corresponding color. So:\n\n- If a bird has C (dominant color) and/or B (dominant size), it's checkered red.\n- If it has C (dominant color) but no B (recessive size), it's checkered brown.\n- If it has no C (homozygous recessive for color) but has B (dominant size), it's plain red.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it's plain brown.\n\nSo, applying this to each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nSo now, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,3,5,6,8,9 \u2192 6 cases\n- Checkered Red: same as above (cases 1,4,7)\n- Checkered Brown: 6 cases\n\nPlain Red: Cases where neither C nor B is present. Looking back, none of the F2 genotypes meet this condition. All have either C or B (except maybe in case where both are cc, but that's brown).\n\nWait, hold on. Cases where neither C nor B are present would require both alleles to be c for color and b for size. So the genotype would be cc bb.\n\nIn our list above, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red. So there's no plain red.\n\nWait, but according to my initial analysis, plain red occurs when neither C nor B is present. So in our F2, the only bird that meets this is cc bb, which is Checkered Red. So there's no plain red in F2.\n\nSimilarly, plain brown is when neither C nor B is present, which isn't happening in F2 because all F2 have at least one C or one B.\n\nWait, that's not possible. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, in F2, the possible genotypes include:\n\n- CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- CC bb (Checkered Brown)\n- Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n- Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- Cc bb (Checkered Brown)\n- cc BB (Checkered Red)\n- cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- cc bb (Checkered Red)\n\nWait, so in F2, all birds except those without any C or B? But in reality, F2 must have at least one allele for either color or size.\n\nWait, no\u2014if all F2 have at least one C or at least one B, then all birds are either Checkered Red or Checkered Brown. There are no plain red or plain brown.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought about plain red. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong about the definition. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by B, and brown by b.\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele (either B or b) will be red, and a bird with at least one dominant allele (either C or c) will be checkered.\n\nThus, a bird could potentially be both red and checkered. But according to the problem statement, I think the traits are exclusive unless both conditions are met.\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color is determined by B. So a bird cannot be both checkered and red unless it's homozygous for both dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the options don't account for such a scenario. Let me assume that the dominance hierarchy is strict: if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either color or checkered, it will display that trait.\n\nThus, a bird can be both checkered and red if it has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B.\n\nBut given the problem's setup, perhaps the dominance is such that one trait takes precedence over the other. However, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed under the assumption that each trait is evaluated separately, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nBut according to the options provided, some mention plain red, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps in the F2 generation, some birds may have neither dominant C nor dominant B, meaning they're plain, but also neither dominant c nor dominant b, meaning they're brown.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, a bird with genotype cc bb would have neither dominant C nor dominant B, so it would be plain brown. Similarly, a bird with genotype Cc bb would have dominant C but no B, so it would be checkered brown.\n\nWait, but in our previous analysis, all F2 have at least one dominant allele for either color or size. So why would there be plain brown birds?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nWait, let me go back. The problem defines:\n\nRed color (B) and brown (b). Also, checkered is due to C, and plain is due to c.\n\nSo, a bird is red if it has at least one B allele, and it's checkered if it has at least one C allele.\n\nIf a bird has neither B nor C alleles, it would be neither red nor checkered, i.e., plain color, but also neither size. However, since the problem mentions brown, which requires at least one b allele (recessive size), a bird with neither B nor b alleles would be brown and also plain in terms of size.\n\nWait, but in standard genetics, if a bird is brown (no B), then regardless of size, it's brown. Similarly, if it's checkered (no C), regardless of size, it's checkered. But if it's neither checkered nor red, does it become brown? Or does it stay brown regardless?\n\nThis is crucial. The problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\n\"Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color is determined by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, a bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (has at least one C) and/or red (has at least one B) \u2192 displays both traits, but typically, dominance takes precedence. However, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume that each trait is evaluated separately, and a bird can exhibit multiple traits if applicable.\n\nBut the key point is that a bird can be:\n\n- Both checkered and red (if it has at least one C and one B)\n- Both checkered and brown (if it has at least one C and one b)\n- Both red and brown (if it has at least one B and one b)\n- None of these (if it has neither dominant C nor dominant B)\n\nWait, but in standard genetic terminology, a bird with both dominant alleles would express both traits. But since the problem doesn't specify dominance hierarchy, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore that and treat each trait independently.\n\nIn any case, going back to the F2 analysis:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether it has at least one dominant allele for either trait.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\n- A bird is red if it has at least one B allele (regardless of C)\n- A bird is checkered if it has at least one C allele (regardless of B)\n- A bird is brown if it has at least one b allele (regardless of C)\n- A bird is plain if it has neither dominant C nor dominant B, i.e., both alleles are c for color and B for size? Wait, no.\n\nWait, no. To be plain, a bird must lack both dominant alleles for both traits.\n\nSo, a bird would be plain if:\n\n- It has no dominant C (i.e., both alleles are c)\n- AND\n- It has no dominant B (i.e., both alleles are b)\n\nBecause having either dominant C or dominant B would mean the bird is either red or checkered.\n\nTherefore, a bird can be:\n\n- Both red and checkered (C and B alleles)\n- Only red (C and b alleles)\n- Only checkered (c and B alleles)\n- Only brown (c and b alleles)\n- Neither (only c and B alleles?)\n\nWait, no, if a bird has both c (color",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that there's a checkered pattern in the pigeon population controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is due to a recessive allele c. Red color is determined by a dominant gene B, and brown by the recessive allele b.\n\nWe need to complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). Then, we have to show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red = CC BB\nParent 2: Plain brown = cc bb\n\nSo each parent will produce gametes based on their genotype.\n\nFor Parent 1 (CCBB):\n- The alleles are both dominant for color (C), so they'll produce gametes with either B or b.\n- Since C is dominant, all gametes will carry at least one C, which means they're all checkered birds because the dominant trait is checkered.\n\nWait, no, actually, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So since both parents are heterozygous for color (C), all their gametes should be CB and cb. Wait, but if Parent 1 is CC BB, then they can only contribute C and B? No, wait, no\u2014the notation might be confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent's genotype:\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 They can only make gametes with CB, because both genes are dominant. So all gametes from Parent 1 are CB.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 Their gametes can only be cb because both genes are recessive.\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, the possible offspring (F1) would be:\n\nParent 1 (CB) x Parent 2 (cb)\n\nSo the possible gametes are CB and cb.\n\nMixing them:\n- CB + cb = CcBb\n- cb + cb = ccbb\n\nBut wait, each parent produces gametes, so the F1 generation will consist of:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb:\n- CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n\nAnd from cb \u00d7 cb:\n- cb \u00d7 cb = ccbb\n\nWait, no, actually, when you cross two different species, the F1 would receive one gamete from each parent. So each F1 individual gets one gamete from each parent. Therefore, the F1 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom Parent 1's CB gamete and Parent 2's cb gamete:\n- CcBb\n\nFrom Parent 1's CB gamete and Parent 2's cb gamete:\n- CcBb\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each F1 bird will get one allele from each parent. So the F1 genotype will be a combination of the alleles from each parent.\n\nSince Parent 1 contributes CB (so C and B) and Parent 2 contributes cb (so c and b), the F1 will have:\n\nC (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2), making Cc for the first gene.\n\nB (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2), making Bb for the second gene.\n\nWait, no. Each parent gives one allele per gene. So for the first gene (color):\n\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\nSo F1: Cc\n\nSecond gene (size):\n\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\nSo F1: Bb\n\nTherefore, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nBut wait, when you have two genes, you can use a Punnett square. Let's construct the F1 parents correctly.\n\nF1 Parents are CcBb and CcBb?\n\nNo, wait. The F1 from the cross of CCBB (which is CcBB?) Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, Parent 1 is CC BB. That means both alleles are dominant for color and both are dominant for size. So their gametes will be CB.\n\nParent 2 is cc bb. Both alleles are recessive, so their gametes will be cb.\n\nWhen these two mated, the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CB (from Parent 1) and cb (from Parent 2): CcBb\n\nBecause:\n- First gene: C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc\n- Second gene: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Bb\n\nSo F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nSo the F2 will be based on the F1 genotypes.\n\nEach F1 bird has genotype CcBb. So when they mate, each gene segregates independently.\n\nLet's look at each gene separately.\n\nFirst gene (color):\n\nParent: Cc \u2192 can produce C and c.\n\nSecond gene (size):\n\nParent: Bb \u2192 can produce B and b.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for each gene:\n\nFor Color Gene:\n\nC | c\n---|---\nC | CC (checkered)\nc | cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for Size Gene:\n\nB | b\n---|---\nB | BB (red)\nb | bb (brown)\n\nSo combining both genes, using a four-square Punnett square:\n\nFirst gene: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc\n\nSecond gene: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nBut wait, when considering the combined effect, each bird has both color and size genes. So each bird's genotype is a combination of the two genes.\n\nSo for the F2 generation:\n\nEach bird's genotype will be a combination of one allele from the color gene and one from the size gene.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom color gene:\n\n- CC (if C from both parents)\n- Cc (if C from one and c from the other)\n- cc (if c from both)\n\nFrom size gene:\n\n- BB (if B from both)\n- Bb (if B from one and b from the other)\n- bb (if b from both)\n\nCombining both, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (C from color, B from size)\n- CC Bb (C from color, b from size)\n- CC bb (C from color, b from size)\n- Cc BB (c from color, B from size)\n- Cc Bb (c from color, b from size)\n- Cc bb (c from color, b from size)\n- cc BB (c from color, B from size)\n- cc Bb (c from color, b from size)\n- cc bb (c from color, b from size)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the alleles present. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for color (i.e., C), it's checkered.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for size (i.e., B), it's red.\n- Otherwise, it's plain for color and brown for size.\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on its genotype.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we can count how many birds fall into each category.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the probability of each genotype and then translate that into phenotype counts.\n\nGiven that the parents are both CcBb, the F2 generation will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since the genes are independent, the overall ratio will be more complex.\n\nHowever, since both genes are being considered together, the Punnett square approach is better.\n\nLet me consider the F2 genotypes.\n\nFor the color gene (Cc x Cc):\n\nProbability of CC = 25%, Cc = 50%, cc = 25%.\n\nFor the size gene (Bb x Bb):\n\nProbability of BB = 25%, Bb = 50%, bb = 25%.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nSo the overall F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: (25% color) * (25% size) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 6.25%\n- CC bb: 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 6.25%\n- Cc Bb: 6.25%\n- Cc bb: 6.25%\n- cc BB: 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 6.25%\n- cc bb: 6.25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because each gene is independent, the actual probabilities multiply.\n\nActually, for each gene, it's 25% for each outcome, so the overall probabilities for each combination are:\n\n(25% for color) * (25% for size) = 6.25% for each combination.\n\nBut since there are nine possible combinations, each with 6.25% chance.\n\nNow, converting these percentages to actual numbers, assuming a total of, say, 100 birds.\n\nEach percentage corresponds to a number.

CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (because color is C, but size is bb \u2192 brown)\nWait, no\u2014wait, if the bird has at least one B, regardless of the size, it's red. Wait, no, the phenotype is determined as follows: if the bird has at least one dominant allele in either gene, it shows the corresponding color. So:\n\n- If a bird has C (dominant color) and/or B (dominant size), it's checkered red.\n- If it has C (dominant color) but no B (recessive size), it's checkered brown.\n- If it has no C (homozygous recessive for color) but has B (dominant size), it's plain red.\n- If it has neither C nor B, it's plain brown.\n\nSo, applying this to each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nSo now, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 4, 7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,3,5,6,8,9 \u2192 6 cases\n- Checkered Red: same as above (cases 1,4,7)\n- Checkered Brown: 6 cases\n\nPlain Red: Cases where neither C nor B is present. Looking back, none of the F2 genotypes meet this condition. All have either C or B (except maybe in case where both are cc, but that's brown).\n\nWait, hold on. Cases where neither C nor B are present would require both alleles to be c for color and b for size. So the genotype would be cc bb.\n\nIn our list above, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red. So there's no plain red.\n\nWait, but according to my initial analysis, plain red occurs when neither C nor B is present. So in our F2, the only bird that meets this is cc bb, which is Checkered Red. So there's no plain red in F2.\n\nSimilarly, plain brown is when neither C nor B is present, which isn't happening in F2 because all F2 have at least one C or one B.\n\nWait, that's not possible.

But in reality, F2 must have at least one allele for either color or size.\n\nWait, no\u2014if all F2 have at least one C or at least one B, then all birds are either Checkered Red or Checkered Brown. There are no plain red or plain brown.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought about plain red. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong about the definition. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by B, and brown by b.\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele (either B or b) will be red, and a bird with at least one dominant allele (either C or c) will be checkered.\n\nThus, a bird could potentially be both red and checkered. But according to the problem statement, I think the traits are exclusive unless both conditions are met.\n\nWait, but the way it's phrased, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color is determined by B. So a bird cannot be both checkered and red unless it's homozygous for both dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the options don't account for such a scenario. Let me assume that the dominance hierarchy is strict: if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either color or checkered, it will display that trait.\n\nThus, a bird can be both checkered and red if it has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B.\n\nBut given the problem's setup, perhaps the dominance is such that one trait takes precedence over the other. However, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed under the assumption that each trait is evaluated separately, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nBut according to the options provided, some mention plain red, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps in the F2 generation, some birds may have neither dominant C nor dominant B, meaning they're plain, but also neither dominant c nor dominant b, meaning they're brown.\n\nWait, that's possible. So, a bird with genotype cc bb would have neither dominant C nor dominant B, so it would be plain brown. Similarly, a bird with genotype Cc bb would have dominant C but no B, so it would be checkered brown.\n\nWait, but in our previous analysis, all F2 have at least one dominant allele for either color or size. So why would there be plain brown birds?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nWait, let me go back. The problem defines:\n\nRed color (B) and brown (b). Also, checkered is due to C, and plain is due to c.\n\nSo, a bird is red if it has at least one B allele, and it's checkered if it has at least one C allele.\n\nIf a bird has neither B nor C alleles, it would be neither red nor checkered, i.e., plain color, but also neither size. However, since the problem mentions brown, which requires at least one b allele (recessive size), a bird with neither B nor b alleles would be brown and also plain in terms of size.\n\nWait, but in standard genetics, if a bird is brown (no B), then regardless of size, it's brown. Similarly, if it's checkered (no C), regardless of size, it's checkered. But if it's neither checkered nor red, does it become brown? Or does it stay brown regardless?\n\nThis is crucial. The problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\n\"Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color is determined by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, a bird can be:\n\n- Checkered (has at least one C) and/or red (has at least one B) \u2192 displays both traits, but typically, dominance takes precedence. However, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume that each trait is evaluated separately, and a bird can exhibit multiple traits if applicable.\n\nBut the key point is that a bird can be:\n\n- Both checkered and red (if it has at least one C and one B)\n- Both checkered and brown (if it has at least one C and one b)\n- Both red and brown (if it has at least one B and one b)\n- None of these (if it has neither dominant C nor dominant B)\n\nWait, but in standard genetic terminology, a bird with both dominant alleles would express both traits. But since the problem doesn't specify dominance hierarchy, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore that and treat each trait independently.\n\nIn any case, going back to the F2 analysis:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether it has at least one dominant allele for either trait.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\n- A bird is red if it has at least one B allele (regardless of C)\n- A bird is checkered if it has at least one C allele (regardless of B)\n- A bird is brown if it has at least one b allele (regardless of C)\n- A bird is plain if it has neither dominant C nor dominant B, i.e., both alleles are c for color and B for size? Wait, no.\n\nWait, no. To be plain, a bird must lack both dominant alleles for both traits.\n\nSo, a bird would be plain if:\n\n- It has no dominant C (i.e., both alleles are c)\n- AND\n- It has no dominant B (i.e., both alleles are b)\n\nBecause having either dominant C or dominant B would mean the bird is either red or checkered.\n\nTherefore, a bird can be:\n\n- Both red and checkered (C and B alleles)\n- Only red (C and b alleles)\n- Only checkered (c and B alleles)\n- Only brown (c and b alleles)\n- Neither (only c and B alleles?)\n\nWait, no, if a bird has both c (color",

One bird is homozygously checkered red (CCBB), meaning both parents are homozygous for two traits. The other bird is plain brown (ccbb). We need to find the phenotypic ratios after an F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the parent genotypes. The first bird is CCBB \u2013 so both dominant alleles are present for both genes. The second bird is ccbb \u2013 both recessive alleles.\n\nSince it's a dihybrid cross, we'll use a Punnett square. The parents are both heterozygotes for both traits because they're checkingered and plain brown. Wait, no, wait\u2014wait, the first bird is CCBB, which means both parents have at least one dominant allele for each trait? No, actually, in dihybrid crosses, if both parents are homozygous for both traits, then all offspring will be homozygous as well. But here, the parents are different: one is CCBB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and the other is ccbb (homozygous recessive for both traits).\n\nWait, that makes sense because the parents can't produce any gametes that would result in a heterozygote. So when you cross CCBB with ccbb, every offspring will be CC (from the first parent) and cc (from the second parent), making them Cc (for the first gene) and Bb (for the second gene). So the F1 generation would all be CcBb.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"adahybridcross,\" but maybe I misread that part. No, probably just dihybrid cross. Anyway, moving on.\n\nWe need to consider the genetic factors. There are two genes involved: one determining color (C and c), and another determining color (B and b). \n\nFor the first gene (C/c), since the parents are CC and cc (wait, no\u2014the first bird is CCBB, so both parents are homozygous for both genes?), or perhaps not. Wait, hold on. The first parent is CCBB, which implies that both genes are dominant. Wait, but if the parents are CCBB and ccbb, how do their gametes look?\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 All gametes are CB.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 All gametes are cb.\n\nSo when you cross these two, each parent contributes either CB or cb. Therefore, all F1 offspring are CcBb. Since each parent is homozygous for both genes, the F1 will also be homozygous for both traits.\n\nNow, considering the traits:\n\n- For the first gene (C/c): In F1, C is present because both parents contribute C from the first gene. So all F1 are C (dominant).\n- For the second gene (B/b): Similarly, both parents contribute B, so all F1 are B.\n\nTherefore, all F1 should express the dominant traits, meaning they are all checkered birds (since the dominant phenotype is checkered, and the recessive is plain). But wait, looking back, the options provided don't include a 100% checkered phenotype. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 generation isn't all checkered because the parents aren't both heterozygotes. Wait, Parent 1 is CCBB, which is a double dominant genotype, meaning both genes are dominant. Parent 2 is ccbb, which is a double recessive. So when crossed, all F1 will have both dominant alleles, resulting in all checkered birds. But the options given don't reflect that. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nAh! Wait, the question mentions a dihybrid cross, but the parents might not be both fully homozygous. Maybe I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are different, like one being CcBB and the other being ccbb, but the user wrote CCBB and ccbb, which would make both parents homozygous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CcBB and ccbb, which would lead to an F1 of CcBb. Then, when creating the Punnett square, the F1 would have various combinations.\n\nWait, looking again at the initial description, the user said the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which are indeed homozygous. Thus, their F1 would all be CcBb, which would mean they are C (checkered) and B (brown), hence checkered brown birds.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match a 100% checkered phenotype. So perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CcBB and ccbb, making the F1 CcBb, leading to possible C and B, so C (checkered) and B (brown), thus checkered brown. But still, that doesn't explain the answer choices.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so F1 is CcBb, which leads to all C and B, so C (checkered) and B (brown), so checkered brown. But the options suggest more variety.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are different. Let me reread the question.\n\nAh, the user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So both are homozygous, meaning their gametes are all the same. Hence, F1 is CcBb, all C and B, so checkered brown. Then, when considering the dihybrid cross, perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and when crossing with itself, the F2 would have a certain distribution.\n\nWait, but the problem states an F2 generation. So starting from the parents CCBB and ccbb, producing F1 CcBb, then F2 from F1 x F1.\n\nBut wait, F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be CcBb x CcBb. The Punnett square for that would involve four combinations of C and B alleles.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the F2 will have 1/4 probability for each combination of C/B. So the possible genotypes would be CcBb, CcBb, etc., but considering all combinations.\n\nHowever, the question asks specifically about phenotypes, so we need to determine the phenotypic ratios based on the genotypes.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the possible genotypes and phenotypes for each gene.\n\nFor Gene 1 (C/c):\n- C (dominant, checkered)\n- c (recessive, plain)\n\nGene 2 (B/b):\n- B (dominant, brown)\n- b (recessive, plain)\n\n2. Combine the possibilities using a Punnett square.\n\nEach parent produces gametes with probabilities:\n- Parent 1: 100% CB (since both alleles are dominant)\n- Parent 2: 100% cb (both alleles are recessive)\n\nThus, all F1 offspring are CcBb (all dominant for both genes), so all exhibit the dominant phenotypes: checkered (C) and brown (B), hence checkered brown.\n\nThen, F2 results from F1 x F1 (CcBB x ccbb isn't correct; F1 is CcBb, so F2 is CcBb x CcBb).\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would involve combining the alleles for each gene independently.\n\nFor Gene 1 (C/c):\nPossible gametes: C and c, each 50% chance.\n\nFor Gene 2 (B/b):\nPossible gametes: B and b, each 50% chance.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n- Gene 1: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) \u2192 Phenotypes: Checkered (C) and Plain (c)\n- Gene 2: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotypes: Brown (B) and Plain (b)\n\nTo get the overall F2 phenotype, combine these.\n\nThere are four possible combinations:\n1. Checkered (C) + Brown (B) = Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered (C) + Plain (b) = Checkered Plain (C b)\n3. Plain (c) + Brown (B) = Plain Brown (c B)\n4. Plain (c) + Plain (b) = Plain (c b)\n\nEach combination has a probability equal to the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nFor example:\n- C (25%) * B (25%) = 6.25%\n- C (25%) * b (25%) = 6.25%\n- c (25%) * B (25%) = 6.25%\n- c (25%) * b (25%) = 6.25%\n\nAdding up all four gives 25% for each phenotype.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies to consider the dihybrid cross, so F2 will have these four phenotypes with equal frequencies.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". That seems incorrect because according to our calculation, all F2 should have checkered brown (C B) as the most common, followed by others.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Let me go back.\n\nThe user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nSo, one parent is homozygous dominant for both traits (C C B B), and the other is homozygous recessive (c c b b). When crossed, all F1 will be CcBb (C and B), so all checkered brown.\n\nThen, the F2 generation comes from F1 x F1, which is CcBb x CcBb.\n\nIn F2:\n- Each gene segregates independently.\n- Genotype probabilities for each gene:\n  - C/C (25%), C/c (50%), cc (25%)\n  - B/B (25%), B/b (50%), bb (25%)\n\nPhenotypically:\n- C (checkered) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C (checkered) and bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- cc (plain) and B \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc (plain) and bb \u2192 Plain\n\nEach phenotype occurs in 25% of the cases.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or equally distributed among the four phenotypes.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly state a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the closest is option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. But that suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I've miscalculated something. Alternatively, maybe the question considers only one trait per bird. But the question specifies two traits.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question uses a dihybrid cross where each gene is separately considered, but perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then yes, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the answer choices don't reflect that. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNope, not matching.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as considering each trait separately. But that wouldn't make sense because the phenotypes are combined.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the parents are CcBB and ccbb, making F1 CcBb, leading to F2 with the usual 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nIf that's the case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that exactly. However, looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included some error in the options.\n\nGiven my analysis, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, I might have missed something. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but one is heterozygous. Let me assume that.\n\nSuppose one parent is CcBB and the other is ccbb. Then, the F1 would be CcBb, which is all dominant for both traits, hence all checkered brown. Then, the F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, leading to 25% C B, 25% C b, 25% c B, 25% c b. So four phenotypes equally likely.\n\nAgain, none of the options match this. The closest is option D: 1,3,9,3, which is a 1:3:9:3 ratio, implying three alleles for one gene. That doesn't apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to describe a scenario where one bird is CcBB and the other is ccBb, leading to F1 CcBb, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the total number of individuals, regardless of phenotype. But that's unlikely.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best fit is option D, assuming a typo in the question regarding the dominance hierarchy, but that seems speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore one trait and focus solely on the other, but that contradicts the question's wording.\n\nConsidering all possibilities, I think the intended correct answer is option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This might imply that one gene affects red/pink/yellow and the other affects brown/orange/red, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CcBB and ccBb, leading to F1 CcBb, and F2 leading to a different ratio. But without knowing the exact setup, it's challenging.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think option D is the most plausible based on standard Mendelian dihybrid cross setups.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then yes, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the answer choices don't reflect that. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNope, not matching.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as considering each trait separately. But that wouldn't make sense because the phenotypes are combined.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the parents are CcBB and ccbb, making F1 CcBb, leading to F2 with the usual 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nIf that's the case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that exactly. However, looking at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included some error in the options.\n\nGiven my analysis, the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not an option, I might have missed something. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but one is heterozygous. Let me assume that.\n\nSuppose one parent is CcBB and the other is ccbb. Then, the F1 would be CcBb, which is all dominant for both traits, hence all checkered brown. Then, the F2 would be CcBb x CcBb, leading to 25% C B, 25% C b, 25% c B, 25% c b. So four phenotypes equally likely.\n\nAgain, none of the options match this. The closest is option D: 1,3,9,3, which is a 1:3:9:3 ratio, implying three alleles for one gene. That doesn't apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to describe a scenario where one bird is CcBB and the other is ccBb, leading to F1 CcBb, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the total number of individuals, regardless of phenotype. But that's unlikely.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best fit is option D, assuming a typo in the question regarding the dominance hierarchy, but that seems speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore one trait and focus solely on the other, but that contradicts the question's wording.\n\nConsidering all possibilities, I think the intended correct answer is option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This might imply that one gene affects red/pink/yellow and the other affects brown/orange/red, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CcBB and ccBb, leading to F1 CcBb, and F2 leading to a different ratio. But without knowing the exact setup, it's challenging.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think option D is the most plausible based on standard Mendelian dihybrid cross setups.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

There are two birds involved in the cross: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both parents must be heterozygous for these traits because they're producing checkered patterns. So their genotype would be CC BB. The other parent is a plain brown bird, meaning both alleles are recessive for those traits, so their genotype is cc bb.\n\nNow, we need to find the F2 generation from crossing these two parents. Wait, but wait\u2014the question says to create an A Punnett square using a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. Hmm, actually, no\u2014wait again. The user provided an initial setup where they're creating gametes from CC BB and cc bb. But then they mention an F1 and F1 cross resulting in CcBb. Then another part that seems like a larger Punnett square with all possible gametes from CC BB and cc bb, including CB, cb, cB, and cb. That seems a bit confusing. Maybe I misread the initial parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part was showing the gametes correctly as (CB), (cb), (cB), (cb). Then, when you cross these F1 birds (CcBb) with themselves, you get an F2 population. So the next step after F1 \u00d7 F1 is to analyze the F2 generation.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio, along with the genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios. The options given are A through H, each suggesting different ratios.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the F2 generation. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their offspring will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each trait. Because for each gene, there's a 50% chance of each allele being passed on. So for the C locus, the parents are CC and cc, so the F1 will all be Cc. Similarly, for the B locus, the parents are BB and bb, so the F1 will all be Bb. Therefore, the F2 generation from F1 \u00d7 F1 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each of the four possible combinations of the two genes. But since the question is about the overall phenotype ratio, I'll focus on that.\n\nEach bird has two independent genes, so the total number of phenotypic classes depends on how many distinct phenotypes result from the combination of the two genes. In this case, since both genes contribute to pigment color, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (from both C and B)\n- Checkered brown (only B)\n- Plain red (only C)\n- Plain brown (neither C nor B)\n\nSo there should be four phenotypes. Now, let's calculate the proportion of each.\n\nFrom the F2 cross, the possible genotypic ratios are 9 (CC BB), 3 (Cc BB), 3 (CC bb), 1 (cc bb) for each gene. But since the two genes are linked? Wait, no, in a standard dihybrid cross without considering linkage, the phenotypic ratio would be based on all combinations. However, if the genes are assumed to assort independently (which isn't always the case), the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for each combination of the two traits.\n\nBut wait, in reality, genes can be linked, affecting the phenotypic ratio. However, the question doesn't specify any linkage, so I think we can assume independent assortment. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1 across all four phenotypes.\n\nWait, but looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nActually, when both parents are pure for each gene (CC BB and cc bb), the F1s will all be Cc Bb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce F2 individuals with a 9:3:3:1 distribution for each gene, but combined into four phenotypes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Both dominant: checkered red (C_B_)\n- C dominant, b recessive: checkered brown (C_bb)\n- c dominant, B recessive: plain red (cc BB)\n- Neither dominant: plain brown (cc bb)\n\nEach of these has a frequency proportional to their respective counts in the F2 generation. Without considering dominance or linkage, each phenotype would occur with equal frequency, but since both genes are controlling pigment, perhaps the presence of B or c affects the color more significantly than the exact combination.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it mentions that red is determined by the C locus and brown by the B locus. So both genes contribute to color, making the phenotypes dependent on both traits.\n\nIn the absence of linkage, the expected phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_) : 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (C_bb) : 3 parts\n- Plain red (cc BB) : 3 parts\n- Plain brown (cc bb) : 1 part\n\nAdding up to 16 parts. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that's not matching. Option G says checkered red 12, etc., which sums to 24, so probably not correct. Option E has 3 checkered red, which would correspond to 3/16, but our calculation suggests 9/16. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual count is different. Let me recount.\n\nThe F2 generation has 16 possible phenotypic outcomes. Each outcome is a combination of the two genes. The number of each phenotype is:\n\n- Both dominant: 9\n- C dominant, b recessive: 3\n- c dominant, B recessive: 3\n- Neither: 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this. Let me look back at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but 6+2=8, 6+2=8, which adds to 16. But the ratio would be 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which doesn't align with our expectation.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16, but this implies that plain red (cc BB) has zero individuals, which contradicts our expectation.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. This matches our expectation exactly. So option C would suggest 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option C is listed as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm whether the phenotypes are correctly assigned. The question specifies that red is C and brown is B. So:\n\n- Both dominant: C_B_ \u2192 checkered red\n- C dominant, b recessive: C_bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- c dominant, B recessive: cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- Neither: cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nYes, that's correct.

The other bird is a plain brown, so its genotype is cc bb. They're crossing these two birds, and we need to create a Punnett square to determine the F2 generation's phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, I remember that dihybrid crosses are about having two genes involved, each with two alleles. In this case, the two genes are C and B, which control color and another trait respectively. The dominant alleles are uppercase (C and B), while lowercase are recessive (c and b).\n\nSo, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. When they cross, each parent will produce gametes based on Mendel's laws. Since both parents are homozygous (no heterozygosity), their gametes should be predictable.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Can only produce gametes with C and B because they're homozygous.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Can only produce gametes with c and b because they're also homozygous.\n\nNow, when these two parents cross, each parent contributes one allele from each gene pair. So, the F1 generation would have all possible combinations of the alleles from both parents.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n- Parent 1 can contribute either C or C (since it's homozygous).\n- Parent 2 can contribute either c or c.\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (B and b):\n- Parent 1 can contribute either B or B.\n- Parent 2 can contribute either b or b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation should have four possible genotypes:\n1. CB\n2. Cb\n3. cB\n4. cb\n\nWait, but since each parent is homozygous, the F1 will all be heterozygous for both genes. That makes sense because each parent is contributing one allele from each gene pair, resulting in all possible combinations.\n\nBut let me make sure. If Parent 1 is CC BB, it can only give C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, giving c and b. So, the F1 would indeed be Cc BB, Cc bb, cC BB, etc., but wait, actually, the notation might vary. Maybe it's better to think in terms of combining the alleles correctly.\n\nWait no, perhaps I got confused. The F1 would have each gene being a combination of the alleles from each parent. So for the first gene (C and c):\n\nParent 1 gives C,\nParent 2 gives c,\n\nso the first gene in F1 would be Cc.\n\nSame for the second gene (B and b):\n\nParent 1 gives B,\nParent 2 gives b,\n\nso the second gene in F1 would be Bb.\n\nPutting them together, the F1 would be Cc Bb. But wait, hold on\u2014that doesn't seem right because each parent is homozygous. Wait, no\u2014each parent is homozygous for both genes, so the F1 should inherit one allele from each parent for each gene, meaning for each gene, there's a 50% chance of getting either allele.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write out the possible gametes.\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC BB):\n- Only can produce gamete with C and B.\n\nFrom Parent 2 (cc bb):\n- Only can produce gamete with c and b.\n\nThus, each F1 individual gets one allele from each parent, so for each gene:\n\nGene C: Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 Cc\nGene B: Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 Bb\n\nWait, but then the F1 would be Cc Bb. However, the way the problem states it, the F1 gametes are listed as (CB) (cb). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each gene separately. Each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, the F1 would be a combination of the alleles from each parent. Since Parent 1 is homozygous for both genes, they'll pass on one allele for each gene, same for Parent 2.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are each homozygous for both traits, so in the F1, each gene will be a heterozygote, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent is homozygous for both traits. So, Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give C and B to the offspring. Similarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give c and b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 individuals will receive one allele from each parent for each gene, making each F1 individual a Cc Bb genotype. So, the F1 would all be Cc Bb, meaning for each gene, they're heterozygous.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Then why does the initial problem mention an F1 cross? Because if both parents are homozygous, the F1 would be all heterozygotes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, but that's not what's happening here because the options suggest different ratios.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's only if both parents are fully homozygous. Here, the parents are each homozygous, but the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, each bird is homozygous for both traits. Therefore, their F1 would all be heterozygous.\n\nWait, but in reality, a dihybrid cross between two homozygous individuals would result in all F1 being heterozygotes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But the answer options don't reflect that. Instead, the options are more complex, implying that the parents are not fully homozygous, but just each has one dominant and one recessive allele for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nCheckered red implies that for both traits, the bird is homozygous. So, for color, it's C and C, and for eye color, it's B and B. So the genotype is CC BB.\n\nPlain brown bird: for color, it's c and c (so cc), and for eye color, it's b and b (so bb). So genotype is cc bb.\n\nSo yes, each parent is homozygous for both traits. Thus, their F1 should all be Cc Bb, and thus, all F1 would be Cc Bb, meaning for each gene, they're heterozygotes.\n\nBut the options given are showing different ratios like 6,2,6,2 or similar. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents aren't both homozygous, but instead, each has one dominant and one recessive allele for each trait. For example, the checkered red bird could be Cc Bb, and the plain brown could be cc bb. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So perhaps the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown is cc bb.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would be Cc Bb crossed with cc bb.\n\nBut in that scenario, the F1 would have all possible combinations, leading to a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, none of the options provided match that exactly.\n\nLooking at the options, for instance, option A shows 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., but I'm not sure how that comes from a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering independent assortment without dominance. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous, but rather, each has one dominant and one recessive allele for each trait.\n\nFor example, the checkered red bird could be Cc Bb, and the plain brown bird could be cc bb. Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb \u00d7 cc bb, leading to a dihybrid cross with 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them perfectly match a 9:3:3:1. However, some options show specific counts, such as option E having 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc., but that still doesn't fit a simple 9:3:3:1 unless simplified.\n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that the F2 generation is being considered after two generations of selfing or something else, but the problem statement isn't clear on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct approach is to model the F1 and F2 generations properly.\n\nWait, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\n   - Parent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\n2. Create the F1 generation by combining the gametes.\n   - From Parent 1: All gametes are C and B.\n   - From Parent 2: All gametes are c and b.\n   - Therefore, F1 will be Cc Bb.\n\n3. Now, the F1 individuals will self-pollinate to get the F2 generation. So, each F1 bird (Cc Bb) will mate with another bird (also Cc Bb).\n\n4. To find the phenotypic ratios, we'll use a Punnett square for dihybrid cross.\n\nThe Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | C | c \n----------|---|---\n        B | CB | CB \n       / \\ |---/ \\\n      B | CB | Bb \n        b | CB | Bb \n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Each gene is independent, so the Punnett square for two genes (C/B and B/b) would involve all combinations.\n\nActually, the correct Punnett square for a dihybrid cross (both genes independently assorting) would list all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent for both genes.\n\nGiven that each F1 bird is Cc Bb, the F2 would include all possible combinations of Cc and Bb for both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model it using the standard dihybrid cross formula.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous (Cc x Cc), the F2 phenotype ratio is 9:3:3:1, assuming dominance.\n\nBut in this case, the parents are each Cc Bb crossed with Cc Bb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are each Cc Bb?\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB (from the first bird) and cc bb (from the second bird). So, each F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 (Cc Bb) \u00d7 F1 (Cc Bb) = F2.\n\nTo calculate the F2 phenotypes, we need to consider all possible gametes from F1 and how they combine.\n\nEach gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities for each gene and then multiply them to get the overall probability.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 only C gametes.\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 only c gametes.\nSo, F1: Cc, with 50% C and 50% c.\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 only B gametes.\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 only b gametes.\nSo, F1: Bb, with 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined F2 phenotypes will be:\n\n- For each gene, the possible outcomes are:\n  - Gene C: C or c\n  - Gene B: B or b\n\nSo, four possible combinations:\n1. C (from Cc) and B (from Bb) \u2192 C B\n2. C (from Cc) and b (from Bb) \u2192 C b\n3. c (from Cc) and B (from Bb) \u2192 c B\n4. c (from Cc) and b (from Bb) \u2192 c b\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nProbability of C B:\n- Gene C: 50% C\n- Gene B: 50% B\n- Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nProbability of C b:\n- Gene C: 50% C\n- Gene B: 50% b\n- Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nProbability of c B:\n- Gene C: 50% c\n- Gene B: 50% B\n- Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nProbability of c b:\n- Gene C: 50% c\n- Gene B: 50% b\n- Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nWait, that suggests all four phenotypes would occur equally, each at 25%, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking back at the answer options, none of them show equal ratios. The highest number in any option is 9, suggesting that perhaps the question is considering dominance.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider the parents' genotypes. If the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown bird is cc bb, then each F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nHowever, under Mendelian inheritance, without considering dominance, each gamete carries either the dominant or recessive allele for each gene. But in reality, dominant traits mask recessive ones.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that red is controlled by C, and brown by B. So, if C is dominant, then the presence of at least one C allele results in red pigment. Similarly, B is dominant for brown.\n\nSo, in the F1, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C (for color) and B (for eye color) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C (color) and b (eye color) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- c (color) and B (eye color) \u2192 Plain Red\n- c (color) and b (eye color) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nEach of these would occur with equal frequency because each gene is independent and each allele is equally likely.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly state 25% for each phenotype. However, the options show numbers like 6,2,6,2 which add up to 16, but the total must divide evenly into 4 groups, each summing to 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to account for dominance and blending. But the problem states that the colors are controlled by dominant and recessive alleles, implying that the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore dominance and treat each phenotype as equally probable, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, all options show different proportions.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes.

Each phenotype occurs 4 times, so the ratio is 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Instead, all options show higher numbers.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means its genotype is CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown, so its genotype is cc bb. They're crossing these two birds, and we need to create a Punnett square to determine the F2 generation's phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, I remember that dihybrid crosses are about having two genes involved, each with two alleles. In this case, the two genes are C and B, which control color and another trait respectively. The dominant alleles are uppercase (C and B), while lowercase are recessive (c and b).\n\nSo, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. When they cross, each parent will produce gametes based on Mendel's laws. Since both parents are homozygous (no heterozygosity), their gametes should be predictable.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Can only produce gametes with C and B because they're homozygous.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Can only produce gametes with c and b because they're also homozygous.\n\nNow, when these two parents cross, each parent contributes one allele from each gene pair. So, the F1 generation would have all possible combinations of the alleles from both parents.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n- Parent 1 can contribute either C or C (since it's homozygous).\n- Parent 2 can contribute either c or c.\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (B and b):\n- Parent 1 can contribute either B or B.\n- Parent 2 can contribute either b or b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation should have four possible genotypes:\n1. CB\n2. Cb\n3. cB\n4. cb\n\nWait, but since each parent is homozygous, the F1 will all be heterozygous for both genes. That makes sense because each parent is contributing one allele from each gene pair, resulting in all possible combinations.\n\nBut let me make sure. If Parent 1 is CC BB, it can only give C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, giving c and b. So, the F1 would indeed be Cc BB, Cc bb, cC BB, etc., but wait, actually, the notation might vary. Maybe it's better to think in terms of combining the alleles correctly.\n\nWait no, perhaps I got confused. The F1 would have each gene being a combination of the alleles from each parent. So for the first gene (C and c):\n\nParent 1 gives C,\nParent 2 gives c,\n\nso the first gene in F1 would be Cc.\n\nSame for the second gene (B and b):\n\nParent 1 gives B,\nParent 2 gives b,\n\nso the second gene in F1 would be Bb.\n\nPutting them together, the F1 would be Cc Bb. But wait, hold on\u2014that doesn't seem right because each parent is homozygous. Wait, no\u2014each parent is homozygous for both genes, so the F1 should inherit one allele from each parent for each gene, meaning for each gene, there's a 50% chance of getting either allele.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write out the possible gametes.\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC BB):\n- Only can produce gamete with C and B.\n\nFrom Parent 2 (cc bb):\n- Only can produce gamete with c and b.\n\nThus, each F1 individual gets one allele from each parent, so for each gene:\n\nGene C: Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 Cc\nGene B: Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 Bb\n\nWait, but then the F1 would be Cc Bb. However, the way the problem states it, the F1 gametes are listed as (CB) (cb). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each gene separately. Each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, the F1 would be a combination of the alleles from each parent. Since Parent 1 is homozygous for both genes, they'll pass on one allele for each gene, same for Parent 2.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are each homozygous for both traits, so in the F1, each gene will be a heterozygote, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent is homozygous for both traits. So, Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give C and B to the offspring. Similarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give c and b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 individuals will receive one allele from each parent for each gene, making each F1 individual a Cc Bb genotype. So, the F1 would all be Cc Bb, meaning for each gene, they're heterozygous.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Then why does the initial problem mention an F1 cross? Because if both parents are homozygous, the F1 would be all heterozygotes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio, but that's not what's happening here because the options suggest different ratios.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's only if both parents are fully homozygous. Here, the parents are each homozygous, but the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, each bird is homozygous for both traits. Therefore, their F1 would all be heterozygous.\n\nWait, but in reality, a dihybrid cross between two homozygous individuals would result in all F1 being heterozygotes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio. But the answer options don't reflect that. Instead, the options are more complex, implying that the parents are not fully homozygous, but just each has one dominant and one recessive allele for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nCheckered red implies that for both traits, the bird is homozygous. So, for color, it's C and C, and for eye color, it's B and B. So the genotype is CC BB.\n\nPlain brown bird: for color, it's c and c (so cc), and for eye color, it's b and b (so bb). So genotype is cc bb.\n\nSo yes, each parent is homozygous for both traits. Thus, their F1 should all be Cc Bb, and thus, all F1 would be Cc Bb, meaning for each gene, they're heterozygotes.\n\nBut the options given are showing different ratios like 6,2,6,2 or similar. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents aren't both homozygous, but instead, each has one dominant and one recessive allele for each trait. For example, the checkered red bird could be Cc Bb, and the plain brown could be cc bb. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So perhaps the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown is cc bb.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would be Cc Bb crossed with cc bb.\n\nBut in that scenario, the F1 would have all possible combinations, leading to a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, none of the options provided match that exactly.\n\nLooking at the options, for instance, option A shows 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., but I'm not sure how that comes from a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering independent assortment without dominance. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous, but rather, each has one dominant and one recessive allele for each trait.\n\nFor example, the checkered red bird could be Cc Bb, and the plain brown bird could be cc bb. Then, the F1 would be Cc Bb \u00d7 cc bb, leading to a dihybrid cross with 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them perfectly match a 9:3:3:1. However, some options show specific counts, such as option E having 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc., but that still doesn't fit a simple 9:3:3:1 unless simplified.\n\nWait, perhaps the question assumes that the F2 generation is being considered after two generations of selfing or something else, but the problem statement isn't clear on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct approach is to model the F1 and F2 generations properly.\n\nWait, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\n   - Parent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\n2. Create the F1 generation by combining the gametes.\n   - From Parent 1: All gametes are C and B.\n   - From Parent 2: All gametes are c and b.\n   - Therefore, F1 will be Cc Bb.\n\n3. Now, the F1 individuals will self-pollinate to get the F2 generation. So, each F1 bird (Cc Bb) will mate with another bird (also Cc Bb).\n\n4. To find the phenotypic ratios, we'll use a Punnett square for dihybrid cross.\n\nThe Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | C | c \n----------|---|---\n        B | CB | CB \n       / \\ |---/ \\\n      B | CB | Bb \n        b | CB | Bb \n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Each gene is independent, so the Punnett square for two genes (C/B and B/b) would involve all combinations.\n\nActually, the correct Punnett square for a dihybrid cross (both genes independently assorting) would list all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent for both genes.\n\nGiven that each F1 bird is Cc Bb, the F2 would include all possible combinations of Cc and Bb for both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model it using the standard dihybrid cross formula.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous (Cc x Cc), the F2 phenotype ratio is 9:3:3:1, assuming dominance.\n\nBut in this case, the parents are each Cc Bb crossed with Cc Bb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are each Cc Bb?\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB (from the first bird) and cc bb (from the second bird). So, each F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 (Cc Bb) \u00d7 F1 (Cc Bb) = F2.\n\nTo calculate the F2 phenotypes, we need to consider all possible gametes from F1 and how they combine.\n\nEach gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities for each gene and then multiply them to get the overall probability.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 only C gametes.\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 only c gametes.\nSo, F1: Cc, with 50% C and 50% c.\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 only B gametes.\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 only b gametes.\nSo, F1: Bb, with 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince both genes are independent, the combined F2 phenotypes will be:\n\n- For each gene, the possible outcomes are:\n  - Gene C: C or c\n  - Gene B: B or b\n\nSo, four possible combinations:\n1. C (from Cc) and B (from Bb) \u2192 C B\n2. C (from Cc) and b (from Bb) \u2192 C b\n3. c (from Cc) and B (from Bb) \u2192 c B\n4. c (from Cc) and b (from Bb) \u2192 c b\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nProbability of C B:\n- Gene C: 50% C\n- Gene B: 50% B\n- Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nProbability of C b:\n- Gene C: 50% C\n- Gene B: 50% b\n- Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nProbability of c B:\n- Gene C: 50% c\n- Gene B: 50% B\n- Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nProbability of c b:\n- Gene C: 50% c\n- Gene B: 50% b\n- Combined: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%)\n\nWait, that suggests all four phenotypes would occur equally, each at 25%, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking back at the answer options, none of them show equal ratios. The highest number in any option is 9, suggesting that perhaps the question is considering dominance.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider the parents' genotypes. If the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown bird is cc bb, then each F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nHowever, under Mendelian inheritance, without considering dominance, each gamete carries either the dominant or recessive allele for each gene. But in reality, dominant traits mask recessive ones.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that red is controlled by C, and brown by B. So, if C is dominant, then the presence of at least one C allele results in red pigment. Similarly, B is dominant for brown.\n\nSo, in the F1, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C (for color) and B (for eye color) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C (color) and b (eye color) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- c (color) and B (eye color) \u2192 Plain Red\n- c (color) and b (eye color) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nEach of these would occur with equal frequency because each gene is independent and each allele is equally likely.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly state 25% for each phenotype. However, the options show numbers like 6,2,6,2 which add up to 16, but the total must divide evenly into 4 groups, each summing to 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to account for dominance and blending. But the problem states that the colors are controlled by dominant and recessive alleles, implying that the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore dominance and treat each phenotype as equally probable, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, all options show different proportions.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nIf the checkered red bird is CC BB, and the plain brown bird is cc bb, then the F1 would be Cc Bb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation.\n\nBut the options do not reflect that. Instead, all options show sums that are multiples of 2 or 3, except for option H, which has 5,3,2,6, adding to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the problem expects us to count the actual number of each phenotype based on the F1 and F2 generations, considering the dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, let me try constructing the Punnett square properly.\n\nEach F1 bird (Cc Bb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nWhen two F1 birds mate, each producing four gametes, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = C C \u2192 Checkered Red (phenotype)\n2. CB \u00d7 Cb = C B \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CB \u00d7 cB = C B \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. CB \u00d7 cb = C b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cb \u00d7 CB = same as above\n6. Cb \u00d7 Cb = c c \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. Cb \u00d7 cB = same as above\n8. Cb \u00d7 cb = c b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cB \u00d7 CB = same as above\n10. cB \u00d7 Cb = same as above\n11. cB \u00d7 cB = cc \u2192 Plain Red\n12. cB \u00d7 cb = c b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n13. cb \u00d7 CB = same as above\n14. cb \u00d7 Cb = same as above\n15. cb \u00d7 cB = same as above\n16. cb \u00d7 cb = cc \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 5, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain Red: Cases 11,12,13,14 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain Brown: Cases 9,10,15,16 \u2192 4 cases\n\nWait, that adds up to 16, which is the total number of possible combinations (4 gametes \u00d7 4 gametes = 16). Each phenotype occurs 4 times, so the ratio is 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Instead, all options show higher numbers. This suggests that perhaps I've misunderstood the problem's setup.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, the dominance hierarchy is B (dominant for red) > b (recessive for red), and B (dominant for brown) > b (recessive for brown).\n\nThus, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for red, it will be red-colored, regardless of the brown color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for brown, it will be brown-colored.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both traits. Therefore, the order of dominance matters in determining the phenotype.\n\nBut",

Since they're both homozygous, their offspring will all be CC BB. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because in a typical dihybrid cross, each parent would contribute one allele. But here, since it's a homozygous parent, all offspring from that parent would inherit the same alleles as themselves. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that first.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and another is \"plain brown.\" So the first bird is CC BB, meaning both parents are homozygous for their respective genes. That makes sense. Now, when we cross them, the F1 generation should all be CC BB. Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the possible gametes are CB or CB (since they're homozygous). So the F1 would all be CC BB, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the other bird is plain brown, which is cc bb. So when you cross CC BB with cc bb, the F1 should all be CcBb. \n\nBut then the question mentions an F2 generation, so perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Maybe the first bird isn't homozygous? Let me read again. It says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Oh, wait, the second bird is just plain brown, not necessarily homozygous. So the parents are CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). When crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F1s self-pollinate to get F2.\n\nSo the F1 is CcBb. To find the F2, we'll look at the Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Each gene is independent, so we can analyze them separately.\n\nFor the C gene (dominant C, recessive c):\n\nIn heterozygotes, the possible gametes are 50% CB and 50% cb. So for C, the probability of producing a C gamete is 50%, and a c is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene (dominant B, recessive b), the gametes are 50% CB and 50% cb.\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 dominant C and dominant B.\n- Checkered brown: CC bb \u2192 dominant C and recessive b.\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 recessive c and dominant B.\n- Plain brown: cc bb \u2192 recessive c and recessive b.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are based on the combination of these.\n\nNow, using the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb) cross:\n\nThe Punnett square will have 16 possible combinations.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for each gene, the possible gametes are CB (50%) and cb (50%).\n\nTo find the probabilities:\n\n- For C:\n   - C occurs in gametes 50% of the time.\n- For c:\n   - c occurs in gametes 50% of the time.\n\nSame for B:\n\n   - B occurs in gametes 50%.\n   - b occurs in gametes 50%.\n\nSince both genes assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC BB): Only when both C and B are dominant. So probability = (probability C) * (probability B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n2. Checkered brown (CC bb): Dominant C and recessive b. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n3. Plain red (cc BB): Recessive c and dominant B. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n4. Plain brown (cc bb): Recessive c and recessive b. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\nWait, that adds up to 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% each for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. However, the question asks about the expected phenotypic ratio, considering dominance and blending.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. In reality, some phenotypes might blend. For example, if a bird has both C and B, it might appear as a mix between red and brown. Similarly for c and b.\n\nBut in the initial analysis, I assumed that each phenotype is distinct based on the presence of dominant alleles. However, in reality, certain combinations may result in blending traits rather than distinct phenotypes.\n\nLet me reconsider. If a bird is CC BB, it's checkered red. If it's CC bb, it's checkered brown. If it's cc BB, it's plain red. And cc bb is plain brown.\n\nHowever, if a bird has Cc BB, it would still be checkered red because the B is dominant. Similarly, cC bb would also be checkered brown. So in terms of phenotype, the only differences are based on whether the bird has the dominant alleles or not.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio remains 25% each, leading to 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says 1,3,9,3 \u2192 which seems like a different ratio, possibly due to blending patterns where some phenotypes combine into broader categories. But according to the standard Mendelian analysis, each phenotype is equally likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers blending instead of distinct phenotypes. For example, a bird with both C and B might appear as a blend, reducing the number of distinct phenotypes.\n\nIf that's the case, let's recalculate assuming blending.\n\nBut without specific information on blending, it's safer to assume that the question expects distinct phenotypes based solely on dominant alleles.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer should reflect equal probabilities, which would mean each phenotype has a 25% chance.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 summing to 16, which fits the 4x4 grid.\n\nWait, but Option G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 which sums to 18, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, but individual counts don't match our expectation.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,5 \u2192 sum to 16, but no.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Perhaps the blending reduces the number of phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering dominance without blending, hence each phenotype is present 25% of the time.\n\nThus, the correct option would be D, which shows 1,3,9,3, but scaled appropriately. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the question.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the options A-G, with each having a specific ratio. Let's re-examine.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 total 16.\n\nWhich corresponds to 1/16, 3/16, etc., but that's not matching our 1/4 each.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The most straightforward approach is to consider each gene separately.\n\nFor each gene (C and B), there's a 25% chance of each outcome.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options exactly represent 1:1:1:1 except perhaps scaling, but the given options seem to suggest blending.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio after considering blending, leading to more individuals with dominant traits.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose that when both C and B are present, the bird appears as a mixture. So the phenotypes could be considered as follows:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B: Checkered red (two dominant traits)\n- Dominant C and recessive b: Checkered brown\n- Recessive c and dominant B: Plain red\n- Recessive c and recessive b: Plain brown\n\nAssuming that blending occurs, some phenotypes may overlap, affecting the actual count.\n\nBut without explicit information, it's hard to know. However, typically in such problems, unless specified otherwise, the assumption is distinct phenotypes based on dominant alleles.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly state that, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the initial assumption was that each phenotype is equally likely, but perhaps in reality, some phenotypes combine. For instance, a bird with both C and B might appear as a blend, making it less likely to be classified as dominant.\n\nBut without specific data, it's difficult. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is D, which represents 1,3,9,3, implying that each phenotype has a higher likelihood of appearing. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation includes both the F1 and F2, but that complicates things further.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 generation correctly. Let's redo the Punnett square properly.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nF1: All CcBb.\n\nF2: F1 \u00d7 F1 \u2192 CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nEach gene segregates independently.\n\nFor the C gene:\n\nProbability of C gamete: 0.5\n\nProbability of c gamete: 0.5\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B.\n\nPhenotype ratios:\n\nCheckered red (CC BB): 0.25\n\nCheckered brown (CC bb): 0.25\n\nPlain red (cc BB): 0.25\n\nPlain brown (cc bb): 0.25\n\nSo, 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none matches exactly. The closest is option D, which suggests checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This would imply a much larger population, which doesn't align with the 4x4 Punnett square.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to F2 generation derived from a different starting point. Maybe the initial cross is F1 \u00d7 F1, but the F2 comes from a different context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the parents. The question states \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, if the first bird is homozygous checkered red, that would be CC BB. The second bird is plain brown, which is cc bb. Thus, their F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 gives F2.\n\nAs previously, the F2 would have phenotypes in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the options don't include this exact ratio. The closest is option D, which seems to have a different distribution, possibly indicating blending.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the question refers to the F2 generation after considering blending, leading to some phenotypes combining.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended for us to consider that the blending results in more dominant traits, changing the ratio.\n\nBut without clear information, it's challenging. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D, as it reflects a higher proportion of checkered traits, suggesting blending effects where some phenotypes combine.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to calculate the actual counts based on the F2 grid.\n\nUsing the F2 Punnett square:\n\nEach gene has 4 possibilities: CC, Cc, cC, cc.\n\nBut since C and B are linked, the segregation is independent.\n\nThe F2 grid would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (checkered red)\n\n- 25% CC Bb (checkered brown)\n\n- 25% Cc BB (plain red)\n\n- 25% Cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nBut if blending occurs, perhaps some of these combine.\n\nBut without specific info, perhaps the intended answer is D, as it shows 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16, fitting a 4x4 grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, which has 2,6,3,5, but I'm not sure.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since none of the options exactly match, perhaps the intended answer is D, which is 1,3,9,3, suggesting a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, not F2. But the question specifies F2.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 phenotypes. Let me recount.\n\nEach gene has a 25% chance of each outcome. So four phenotypes, each 25% of the F2.\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is D, which is 1,3,9,3, indicating a different calculation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that blending occurs, leading to more dominant traits, thus increasing the frequency of checkered traits.\n\nBut without specific information, it's unclear. Given the ambiguity, I think the best choice is D, as it's the only option showing a balanced distribution among the four phenotypes, despite the numbers adding up to 16.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two birds being crossed: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both parents have the genotype CC BB. Since they're both homozygous, their offspring will all be CC BB. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because in a typical dihybrid cross, each parent would contribute one allele. But here, since it's a homozygous parent, all offspring from that parent would inherit the same alleles as themselves. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that first.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and another is \"plain brown.\" So the first bird is CC BB, meaning both parents are homozygous for their respective genes. That makes sense. Now, when we cross them, the F1 generation should all be CC BB. Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the possible gametes are CB or CB (since they're homozygous). So the F1 would all be CC BB, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the other bird is plain brown, which is cc bb. So when you cross CC BB with cc bb, the F1 should all be CcBb. \n\nBut then the question mentions an F2 generation, so perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Maybe the first bird isn't homozygous? Let me read again. It says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" Oh, wait, the second bird is just plain brown, not necessarily homozygous. So the parents are CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). When crossed, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F1s self-pollinate to get F2.\n\nSo the F1 is CcBb. To find the F2, we'll look at the Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Each gene is independent, so we can analyze them separately.\n\nFor the C gene (dominant C, recessive c):\n\nIn heterozygotes, the possible gametes are 50% CB and 50% cb. So for C, the probability of producing a C gamete is 50%, and a c is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene (dominant B, recessive b), the gametes are 50% CB and 50% cb.\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 dominant C and dominant B.\n- Checkered brown: CC bb \u2192 dominant C and recessive b.\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 recessive c and dominant B.\n- Plain brown: cc bb \u2192 recessive c and recessive b.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are based on the combination of these.\n\nNow, using the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb) cross:\n\nThe Punnett square will have 16 possible combinations.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for each gene, the possible gametes are CB (50%) and cb (50%).\n\nTo find the probabilities:\n\n- For C:\n   - C occurs in gametes 50% of the time.\n- For c:\n   - c occurs in gametes 50% of the time.\n\nSame for B:\n\n   - B occurs in gametes 50%.\n   - b occurs in gametes 50%.\n\nSince both genes assort independently, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC BB): Only when both C and B are dominant. So probability = (probability C) * (probability B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n2. Checkered brown (CC bb): Dominant C and recessive b. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n3. Plain red (cc BB): Recessive c and dominant B. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n4. Plain brown (cc bb): Recessive c and recessive b. Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\nWait, that adds up to 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% each for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. However, the question asks about the expected phenotypic ratio, considering dominance and blending.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. In reality, some phenotypes might blend.

Similarly, cC bb would also be checkered brown.

They're asking about an A Punnett square for an dihybrid cross, but wait, no\u2014the cross is between these two, which are each parents for their offspring. Then they want the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotype frequencies, and phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014no, actually, the question says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, maybe I misread earlier. Oh, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross between CCBB and ccbb, resulting in F1, then F2. But let me clarify:\n\nWait, the first part says \"a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" which might be confusing because dihybrid crosses involve two traits. Maybe it's a different kind of cross? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it should be a F1 generation followed by F2?\n\nBut looking back at the user's query, after listing gametes and F1, they proceed to list F2 gametes and F2 individuals. So maybe the question is about the F2 from a cross where the parents are CCBB and ccbb, making them both heterozygotes for both genes.\n\nWait, no, CCBB means the bird has two dominant alleles for both genes, while ccbb has two recessive alleles. So their F1 would all be CcBb. Then the next generation, F2, would have more possibilities based on the F1 gametes.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to set up a Punnett square for the F1 (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) and then analyze the phenotypes, genotypes, etc., leading to F2 results.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the possible gametes from each parent.\n   - Parent 1: CCBB \u2192 can only produce CB gamete (since both alleles are dominant).\n   - Parent 2: ccbb \u2192 can only produce cb gamete (both alleles are recessive).\n\n2. Create the Punnett square:\n   - Each gamete from Parent 1 combines with each gamete from Parent 2.\n   - So, CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (for each combination). Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Actually, when you have separate gametes, the combinations are like CB \u00d7 cb, so the F1 will all be CcBb. But since both parents contribute only one type of gamete (from each), all F1 will be CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes either CB or cb. So, each F1 will receive CB from one parent and cb from the other. Therefore, the F1 genotype will be CcBb. That makes sense because both parents are homozygous, so all F1 will be the same.\n\nThen, the F2 generation comes from selfing F1 birds. Since F1 is CcBb, the Punnett square for F2 will consider all possible combinations.\n\nThe F2 will have four types of gametes based on F1:\n\n- CB: probability (1/4)\n- cb: probability (1/4)\n- cB: probability (1/4)\n- bc: probability (1/4)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because F1 is CcBb, which can produce any of its gametes. The number of possible gametes depends on the dominance and the actual alleles present. So, each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc. Each has a 25% chance.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will result from F1 \u00d7 F1, so the Punnett square will look like this:\n\n       | CB    | cb    | cB    | bc\n-------|--------|--------|------|----\n      CB    | 1/16 CC BB | 1/16 Cc BB | 1/16 Cc Bb | 1/16 Cc bb\n      cb     | 1/16 CC bb | 1/16 Cc bb | 1/16 Cc Bb | 1/16 cc bb\n      cB     | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc Bb | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc bb\n      bc     | 1/16 cc bb | 1/16 cc Bb | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up the labels. Let me correct that.\n\nEach F1 bird produces four types of gametes:\n\n- CB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n- cB: 25%\n- bc: 25%\n\nWhen these combine, the F2 genotypes are calculated as follows:\n\nFor each possible pair of gametes:\n\n1.

Alternatively, considering all possible combinations:\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- CC bb (from CB \u00d7 bc and bc \u00d7 CB)\n- cc BB (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 cB, cB \u00d7 cb, cB \u00d7 bc, bc \u00d7 cB)\n- cc bb (from cb \u00d7 bc and bc \u00d7 cb)\n- cc BB (wait, no\u2014actually, all cc will come from cc \u00d7 cc)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate using the probabilities correctly.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for dihybrid cross:\n\nPhenotype frequency = (proportion of each genotype) \u00d7 (phenotypic ratio per genotype).\n\nSince both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypes can be calculated separately, then combined.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n\nPhenotype ratio: CC : Cc : cc = 9 : 3 : 1\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (B and b): BB : Bb : bb = 9 : 3 : 1\n\nSince both genes are independent, the overall ratio is (9+3+1)\u00b2 = 16\u00b2 = 256 possible combinations. However, we need to group them by phenotype.\n\nLooking at the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC BB)\n2. Checkered brown (CC Bb)\n3. Plain red (cc BB)\n4. Plain brown (cc Bb)\n\nNow, let's compute the proportion for each phenotype.\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Checkered red):\n\nOnly occurs when both genes are dominant: CC \u00d7 BB. The probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nProportion: 1/16.\n\nPhenotype 2 (Checkered brown):\n\nDominant C and dominant B. Probability is (1/4)*(3/4) + (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 + 3/16 = 6/16.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me recast:\n\nProbability of C (dominant) is 3/4, and B (dominant) is 3/4.\n\nSo, for phenotype 2: CC \u00d7 Bb (but wait, no\u2014it's CC and Bb? No, wait. The phenotype is determined by whether the individual is red or brown. Red is when both C and B are dominant (CC BB or CC Bb?), wait no.\n\nWait, let me get the dominance straight.\n\nWait, the checkered pattern is due to C (dominant), and plain color is due to c (recessive). Red is when C is present, and brown is when c is present, regardless of B.\n\nSimilarly, B is dominant over b. So:\n\n- Red: presence of C (either dominant or recessive, but if C is present, regardless of B, it's red?)\nWait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by C, and the color is determined by B. So, if an animal has at least one dominant C (so CC or Cc), it'll appear checkered (red). If it has no C (cc), then it'll be plain, and the color depends on B: if it has at least one dominant B (BB or Bb), it's brown; otherwise, it's plain brown.\n\nTherefore:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red \u2192 presence of C (i.e., CC or Cc)\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown \u2192 presence of C and absence of c (i.e., CC or Cc, but without bb)\nWait, no\u2014if an animal has C, it's red, regardless of B. So, phenotypes are based on whether C is present (red) or not (plain), and within that, whether B is present (brown) or not (plain).\n\nSo:\n\nRed: C present (any B)\nBrown: C absent (cc) and B present (BB or Bb)\nPlain brown: C absent and B absent (bb)\nPlain: neither C nor B (cc bb)\n\nGiven that, let's recompute the proportions.\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Checkered red):\n\nProbability = (probability of having at least one C) \u00d7 (probability of having at least one B or none?)\n\nWait, no\u2014since being red just requires at least one C, regardless of B. And within that, it's already red. Brown requires C and B.\n\nSo, the breakdown:\n\nTotal for red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 sum these probabilities.\n\nSimilarly, for brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 these require C and B recessive.\n\nSo, let's compute:\n\nTotal red: (1/4 * 1/4) + (1/4 * 3/4) + (3/4 * 1/4) + (3/4 * 3/4) ?\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, each gene's contribution is multiplicative.\n\nActually, the probability for each combination:\n\n- CC BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- CC Bb: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Cc BB: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Cc Bb: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nAdding these up: 1/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nFor brown:\n\n- CC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- Cc bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nSum: 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.\n\nFor plain brown:\n\n- cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nFor plain:\n\n- cc BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- cc Bb: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- cc BB: Wait, no\u2014wait, all cc individuals have Bb? No, wait, cc bb is plain brown, and cc BB is plain red.\n\nWait, no\u2014a bird can't have cc BB because that would mean it's cc (no C) and BB (no b). So, cc BB is impossible because c is recessive, so an individual must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, cc BB is impossible because it lacks C (which is necessary for being red). Similarly, cc Bb is possible (if B is present but C is absent), but wait, no\u2014because B is dominant, so even if B is present, the bird is brown if C is also present. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of C (red) or not (plain), and within that, the presence of B (brown) or not.\n\nSo, cc bb: C is absent, B is absent \u2192 plain brown.\ncc Bb: C is absent, B is present \u2192 brown.\ncc BB: C is absent, B is present (even though B is dominant) \u2192 brown.\ncc BB: same as above, but redundant.\n\nWait, but in reality, having cc BB is impossible because C must be present for red, so cc BB is non-existent in this context.\n\nTherefore, for phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red (C present): 1/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16 = 1, which can't be right. Wait, no\u2014earlier calculation shows that the red phenotypes are 1/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16, which is 1. That's impossible because there's a total of 16/16, meaning all individuals are red. That can't be right.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake. The total for red shouldn't exceed 1. Let me recount:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n- CC Bb: 3/16\n- Cc BB: 3/16\n- Cc Bb: 9/16\n\nAdding these gives 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16, plus another 3/16 makes 7/16, plus 9/16 makes 16/16=1. So all reds add up correctly.\n\nSimilarly, brown is 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16=1/4.\n\nPlain brown is 1/16.\n\nPlain is 1/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 5/16.\n\nWait, that adds up to 16/16=1.\n\nBut according to the options provided, none match exactly, so perhaps I need to adjust my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me try a different approach.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for dihybrid cross:\n\nParental genotypes: CCBB and ccbb.\n\nEach parent produces four gametes:\n\n- From CCBB: CB (25%)\n- From ccbb: cb (25%)\n\nThus, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations:\n\nCB \u00d7 cb = CcBb,\nCB \u00d7 cb = CcBb,\ncb \u00d7 cb = ccBb,\ncb \u00d7 cb = ccBb.\n\nWait, but each parent contributes one gamete, so each F1 bird will be CcBb. Thus, all F1 are CcBb, meaning they can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc, each at 25%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will be:\n\nEach F1 bird (CcBb) produces four gametes, each with equal probability.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would look like:\n\n        | CB    | cb    | cB    | bc\n-------|--------|--------|------|----\n      CB    | 1/16 CC BB | 1/16 Cc BB | 1/16 Cc Bb | 1/16 CC bb\n      cb     | 1/16 CC bb | 1/16 Cc bb | 1/16 Cc Bb | 1/16 cc bb\n      cB     | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc Bb | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc bb\n      bc     | 1/16 cc bb | 1/16 cc Bb | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc bb\n\nNow, grouping the F2 into phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC BB):\n   - Only from CB \u00d7 CB: 1/16 CC BB.\n\n2. Checkered brown (CC Bb):\n   - From CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB: 1/16 + 1/16 = 2/16.\n   - Also, from cb \u00d7 cb: 1/16 CC bb? No, wait, that's plain brown.\n   Wait, no\u2014wait, when CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb, which is brown, and cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb, so those are brown. Additionally, CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb, and cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb. Wait, no, CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB give the same CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up the gametes. Let me correct:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (checkered red)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- CB \u00d7 cB: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- CB \u00d7 bc: CC bb (plain brown)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (plain brown)\n- cb \u00d7 cB: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cb \u00d7 bc: cc bb (plain brown)\n- cB \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- cB \u00d7 cb: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cB \u00d7 cB: cc BB (plain red)\n- cB \u00d7 bc: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- bc \u00d7 CB: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- bc \u00d7 cb: cc bb (plain brown)\n- bc \u00d7 cB: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- bc \u00d7 bc: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 1/16.\n- Checkered brown: Cc Bb appears in multiple combinations. Specifically, when one parent contributes CB and the other cb, or vice versa, giving Cc Bb. Plus",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe setup involves two birds crossing, one that's a dominant checkered red (CCBB) and another that's a plain brown (ccbb). They're asking about an A Punnett square for an dihybrid cross, but wait, no\u2014the cross is between these two, which are each parents for their offspring. Then they want the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotype frequencies, and phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014no, actually, the question says \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, maybe I misread earlier. Oh, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross between CCBB and ccbb, resulting in F1, then F2. But let me clarify:\n\nWait, the first part says \"a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" which might be confusing because dihybrid crosses involve two traits. Maybe it's a different kind of cross? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it should be a F1 generation followed by F2?\n\nBut looking back at the user's query, after listing gametes and F1, they proceed to list F2 gametes and F2 individuals. So maybe the question is about the F2 from a cross where the parents are CCBB and ccbb, making them both heterozygotes for both genes.\n\nWait, no, CCBB means the bird has two dominant alleles for both genes, while ccbb has two recessive alleles. So their F1 would all be CcBb. Then the next generation, F2, would have more possibilities based on the F1 gametes.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to set up a Punnett square for the F1 (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) and then analyze the phenotypes, genotypes, etc., leading to F2 results.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the possible gametes from each parent.\n   - Parent 1: CCBB \u2192 can only produce CB gamete (since both alleles are dominant).\n   - Parent 2: ccbb \u2192 can only produce cb gamete (both alleles are recessive).\n\n2. Create the Punnett square:\n   - Each gamete from Parent 1 combines with each gamete from Parent 2.\n   - So, CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb (for each combination). Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Actually, when you have separate gametes, the combinations are like CB \u00d7 cb, so the F1 will all be CcBb. But since both parents contribute only one type of gamete (from each), all F1 will be CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes either CB or cb. So, each F1 will receive CB from one parent and cb from the other. Therefore, the F1 genotype will be CcBb. That makes sense because both parents are homozygous, so all F1 will be the same.\n\nThen, the F2 generation comes from selfing F1 birds. Since F1 is CcBb, the Punnett square for F2 will consider all possible combinations.\n\nThe F2 will have four types of gametes based on F1:\n\n- CB: probability (1/4)\n- cb: probability (1/4)\n- cB: probability (1/4)\n- bc: probability (1/4)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because F1 is CcBb, which can produce any of its gametes. The number of possible gametes depends on the dominance and the actual alleles present. So, each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc. Each has a 25% chance.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will result from F1 \u00d7 F1, so the Punnett square will look like this:\n\n       | CB    | cb    | cB    | bc\n-------|--------|--------|------|----\n      CB    | 1/16 CC BB | 1/16 Cc BB | 1/16 Cc Bb | 1/16 Cc bb\n      cb     | 1/16 CC bb | 1/16 Cc bb | 1/16 Cc Bb | 1/16 cc bb\n      cB     | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc Bb | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc bb\n      bc     | 1/16 cc bb | 1/16 cc Bb | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up the labels. Let me correct that.\n\nEach F1 bird produces four types of gametes:\n\n- CB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n- cB: 25%\n- bc: 25%\n\nWhen these combine, the F2 genotypes are calculated as follows:\n\nFor each possible pair of gametes:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CC Bb\n3. CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CC Bb\n4.

Alternatively, considering all possible combinations:\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- CC bb (from CB \u00d7 bc and bc \u00d7 CB)\n- cc BB (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 cB, cB \u00d7 cb, cB \u00d7 bc, bc \u00d7 cB)\n- cc bb (from cb \u00d7 bc and bc \u00d7 cb)\n- cc BB (wait, no\u2014actually, all cc will come from cc \u00d7 cc)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate using the probabilities correctly.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for dihybrid cross:\n\nPhenotype frequency = (proportion of each genotype) \u00d7 (phenotypic ratio per genotype).\n\nSince both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypes can be calculated separately, then combined.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n\nPhenotype ratio: CC : Cc : cc = 9 : 3 : 1\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (B and b): BB : Bb : bb = 9 : 3 : 1\n\nSince both genes are independent, the overall ratio is (9+3+1)\u00b2 = 16\u00b2 = 256 possible combinations. However, we need to group them by phenotype.\n\nLooking at the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC BB)\n2. Checkered brown (CC Bb)\n3. Plain red (cc BB)\n4. Plain brown (cc Bb)\n\nNow, let's compute the proportion for each phenotype.\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Checkered red):\n\nOnly occurs when both genes are dominant: CC \u00d7 BB. The probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nProportion: 1/16.\n\nPhenotype 2 (Checkered brown):\n\nDominant C and dominant B. Probability is (1/4)*(3/4) + (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 + 3/16 = 6/16.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me recast:\n\nProbability of C (dominant) is 3/4, and B (dominant) is 3/4.\n\nSo, for phenotype 2: CC \u00d7 Bb (but wait, no\u2014it's CC and Bb? No, wait. The phenotype is determined by whether the individual is red or brown. Red is when both C and B are dominant (CC BB or CC Bb?), wait no.\n\nWait, let me get the dominance straight.\n\nWait, the checkered pattern is due to C (dominant), and plain color is due to c (recessive). Red is when C is present, and brown is when c is present, regardless of B.\n\nSimilarly, B is dominant over b. So:\n\n- Red: presence of C (either dominant or recessive, but if C is present, regardless of B, it's red?)\nWait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by C, and the color is determined by B. So, if an animal has at least one dominant C (so CC or Cc), it'll appear checkered (red). If it has no C (cc), then it'll be plain, and the color depends on B: if it has at least one dominant B (BB or Bb), it's brown; otherwise, it's plain brown.\n\nTherefore:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red \u2192 presence of C (i.e., CC or Cc)\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown \u2192 presence of C and absence of c (i.e., CC or Cc, but without bb)\nWait, no\u2014if an animal has C, it's red, regardless of B. So, phenotypes are based on whether C is present (red) or not (plain), and within that, whether B is present (brown) or not (plain).\n\nSo:\n\nRed: C present (any B)\nBrown: C absent (cc) and B present (BB or Bb)\nPlain brown: C absent and B absent (bb)\nPlain: neither C nor B (cc bb)\n\nGiven that, let's recompute the proportions.\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Checkered red):\n\nProbability = (probability of having at least one C) \u00d7 (probability of having at least one B or none?)\n\nWait, no\u2014since being red just requires at least one C, regardless of B. And within that, it's already red. Brown requires C and B.\n\nSo, the breakdown:\n\nTotal for red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 sum these probabilities.\n\nSimilarly, for brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 these require C and B recessive.\n\nSo, let's compute:\n\nTotal red: (1/4 * 1/4) + (1/4 * 3/4) + (3/4 * 1/4) + (3/4 * 3/4) ?\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, each gene's contribution is multiplicative.\n\nActually, the probability for each combination:\n\n- CC BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- CC Bb: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Cc BB: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Cc Bb: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nAdding these up: 1/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nFor brown:\n\n- CC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- Cc bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nSum: 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.\n\nFor plain brown:\n\n- cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nFor plain:\n\n- cc BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- cc Bb: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n- cc BB: Wait, no\u2014wait, all cc individuals have Bb? No, wait, cc bb is plain brown, and cc BB is plain red.\n\nWait, no\u2014a bird can't have cc BB because that would mean it's cc (no C) and BB (no b). So, cc BB is impossible because c is recessive, so an individual must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, cc BB is impossible because it lacks C (which is necessary for being red). Similarly, cc Bb is possible (if B is present but C is absent), but wait, no\u2014because B is dominant, so even if B is present, the bird is brown if C is also present. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of C (red) or not (plain), and within that, the presence of B (brown) or not.\n\nSo, cc bb: C is absent, B is absent \u2192 plain brown.\ncc Bb: C is absent, B is present \u2192 brown.\ncc BB: C is absent, B is present (even though B is dominant) \u2192 brown.\ncc BB: same as above, but redundant.\n\nWait, but in reality, having cc BB is impossible because C must be present for red, so cc BB is non-existent in this context.\n\nTherefore, for phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red (C present): 1/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16 = 1, which can't be right. Wait, no\u2014earlier calculation shows that the red phenotypes are 1/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16, which is 1. That's impossible because there's a total of 16/16, meaning all individuals are red. That can't be right.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake. The total for red shouldn't exceed 1. Let me recount:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n- CC Bb: 3/16\n- Cc BB: 3/16\n- Cc Bb: 9/16\n\nAdding these gives 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16, plus another 3/16 makes 7/16, plus 9/16 makes 16/16=1. So all reds add up correctly.\n\nSimilarly, brown is 1/16 + 3/16 = 4/16=1/4.\n\nPlain brown is 1/16.\n\nPlain is 1/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 5/16.\n\nWait, that adds up to 16/16=1.\n\nBut according to the options provided, none match exactly, so perhaps I need to adjust my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me try a different approach.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for dihybrid cross:\n\nParental genotypes: CCBB and ccbb.\n\nEach parent produces four gametes:\n\n- From CCBB: CB (25%)\n- From ccbb: cb (25%)\n\nThus, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations:\n\nCB \u00d7 cb = CcBb,\nCB \u00d7 cb = CcBb,\ncb \u00d7 cb = ccBb,\ncb \u00d7 cb = ccBb.\n\nWait, but each parent contributes one gamete, so each F1 bird will be CcBb. Thus, all F1 are CcBb, meaning they can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc, each at 25%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will be:\n\nEach F1 bird (CcBb) produces four gametes, each with equal probability.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would look like:\n\n        | CB    | cb    | cB    | bc\n-------|--------|--------|------|----\n      CB    | 1/16 CC BB | 1/16 Cc BB | 1/16 Cc Bb | 1/16 CC bb\n      cb     | 1/16 CC bb | 1/16 Cc bb | 1/16 Cc Bb | 1/16 cc bb\n      cB     | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc Bb | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc bb\n      bc     | 1/16 cc bb | 1/16 cc Bb | 1/16 cc BB | 1/16 cc bb\n\nNow, grouping the F2 into phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC BB):\n   - Only from CB \u00d7 CB: 1/16 CC BB.\n\n2. Checkered brown (CC Bb):\n   - From CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB: 1/16 + 1/16 = 2/16.\n   - Also, from cb \u00d7 cb: 1/16 CC bb? No, wait, that's plain brown.\n   Wait, no\u2014wait, when CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb, which is brown, and cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb, so those are brown. Additionally, CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb, and cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb. Wait, no, CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB give the same CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up the gametes. Let me correct:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (checkered red)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- CB \u00d7 cB: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- CB \u00d7 bc: CC bb (plain brown)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (plain brown)\n- cb \u00d7 cB: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cb \u00d7 bc: cc bb (plain brown)\n- cB \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- cB \u00d7 cb: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cB \u00d7 cB: cc BB (plain red)\n- cB \u00d7 bc: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- bc \u00d7 CB: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- bc \u00d7 cb: cc bb (plain brown)\n- bc \u00d7 cB: cc Bb (plain brown)\n- bc \u00d7 bc: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 1/16.\n- Checkered brown: Cc Bb appears in multiple combinations. Specifically, when one parent contributes CB and the other cb, or vice versa, giving Cc Bb. Plus",

The traits are controlled by genes, and we need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between them. Then, based on that, determine the phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given:\n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is from the recessive allele c.\n- Red color is from a dominant gene B.\n- Brown is from the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for these genes. Since it's a dihybrid cross, but since both parents are different, it might be a bit more complex than a typical dihybrid cross where both parents are the same.\n\nThe first parent is a checkered red bird. That should mean that it has both dominant alleles for the checking pattern and the red color. So, its genotype would be CcBB because the pattern is dominant (C), and red is dominant (B). Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, checkered is C, which is dominant, so that bird must have at least one C allele. But if it's a checkered pattern, does that mean it has both C and c? Or just one C?\n\nWait, the initial statement says \"checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" So, perhaps the presence of C is required for the checkered pattern. So, maybe the bird has at least one C allele for the pattern, and the rest depends on the other genes. But the color comes into play next.\n\nThe first parent is also described as a checkered red bird. So, I think that means their genotype is Cc (since they're checkered, which requires at least one dominant allele, say C, or maybe they have both C and c but not necessarily in the right proportion. Wait, but usually, dominance refers to whether an individual has at least one copy of the dominant allele. So, if a bird is Cc, it will express the dominant trait, regardless of whether it has another allele. But wait, no\u2014the actual phenotype depends on all the alleles. So, for example, if a bird is Cc for the pattern, it will have a checkered pattern, but the color may vary based on other genes.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's move step by step.\n\nThe second parent is a plain brown bird. So, their genotype would be ccbb because they are plain (so no dominant allele for any trait except perhaps color, but since they're plain, they don't have any dominant allele, hence cc) and brown (which is recessive, so bb).\n\nNow, the cross is between a checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So, the first parent is CcBB (assuming that the pattern is dominant, so at least one C, and red is dominant, so at least one B). Wait, but the way the genes are presented is probably additive. So, each trait is controlled independently. So, the presence of C affects the pattern, and B affects color.\n\nTherefore, the first parent (checkered red) would have the genotype CcBB because they have at least one C (for the pattern) and at least one B (for red). The second parent is plain brown, so genotype ccbb because they have no dominant alleles for either trait (plain) and both are recessive (brown).\n\nNow, when these two parents are crossed, we'll get F1 individuals. But since the question asks about the F2 generation, I think we need to consider that the F1 generation itself undergoes another cross. However, the question seems to suggest creating a Punnett square directly for the cross between the two parents without explicitly stating the F1 generation. Hmm, maybe I misread the setup.\n\nWait, looking back: the user provided a detailed scenario, including possible gametes, resulting in F1 and then F2. But the question seems to ask about a specific cross, perhaps between a checkered red and a plain brown bird, leading to F1 and then F2.\n\nHowever, the key here is that the question is about the adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So, let's focus on that.\n\nLet me clarify the cross:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 genotype CcBB? Wait, no\u2014if it's homozygous, then both alleles are C and B. So, genotype is CcBB? No, wait\u2014it's homozygous, so both alleles are the same. If it's checkered red, then perhaps it's CC BB because the pattern is dominant, requiring at least one C, and red is dominant, requiring at least one B. But wait, checkered could refer to having both patterns, which would require two dominant alleles. So, perhaps the correct genotype is CC BB, meaning both dominant alleles for the pattern and dominant for red color.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is dominant, so perhaps the bird has at least one dominant allele for the pattern, making it checkered. Similarly, the red color is dominant, so at least one red allele. So, the genotype would be CC BB.\n\nSimilarly, the other parent is plain brown \u2192 genotype cc bb.\n\nSo, the cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nNow, to create the Punnett square, we'll look at each combination of alleles from the parents.\n\nFor the first gene (pattern):\n\nParent 1: CC (both C)\nParent 2: cc (one c)\n\nPossible gametes from Parent 1: CC\nFrom Parent 2: c\n\nSo, F1 gametes from this gene: CC (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2). Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. So, Parent 1 gives CC, Parent 2 gives c. So, the F1 has the genotype Cc for the pattern.\n\nFor the second gene (color):\n\nParent 1: BB (both B)\nParent 2: bb (both b)\n\nPossible gametes:\nFrom Parent 1: B\nFrom Parent 2: b\n\nSo, F1 gametes: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2). Thus, the F1 genotype is Bb.\n\nSo, the F1 offspring will have the genotype Cc Bb.\n\nNow, when F1s self-fertilize (F2 generation), we can analyze their phenotypes.\n\nEach F1 bird has the genotype Cc Bb.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we need to determine how many have each combination of traits.\n\nPhenotype determination is based on dominant/recessive relationships.\n\nPattern (C): C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will have the checkered pattern. So, Cc and CC will have checkered, while cc will be plain.\n\nColor (B): B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will have red color, while bb will be brown.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypes combine based on both genes.\n\nSo, possible combinations:\n\n1. Checkered (C) + Red (B) = Checkered Red\n2. Checkered (C) + Brown (b) = Checkered Brown\n3. Plain (cc) + Red (B) = Plain Red\n4. Plain (cc) + Brown (b) = Plain Brown\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities.\n\nFor the pattern (C):\nProbability of C (dominant) = 3/4 (since there are three possibilities: CC, Cc, Cc, cc; so CC and Cc give dominant C).\nThus, probability of Checkered = 3/4.\n\nFor color (B):\nProbability of B (dominant) = 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for each phenotype.\n\nWait, but let me confirm.\n\nEach gene's segregation is independent, so:\n\nFor the pattern:\n\n- CC: 25% chance\n- Cc: 50% chance\n- cc: 25% chance\n\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSo, combining these, the four phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered Red (CC & BB): 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 9/16\n\nCheckered Brown (CC & Bb): 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2/16\n\nPlain Red (cc & BB): 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 9/16\n\nPlain Brown (cc & Bb): 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 2 + 9 + 2 = 22, which doesn't make sense because probabilities should sum to 100%. Wait, I think I made a mistake in multiplying the fractions.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to calculate the probabilities separately:\n\nFor the pattern (C):\n\nProbability of C (at least one dominant allele) = 3/4.\n\nFor color (B):\n\nProbability of B (at least one dominant allele) = 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Checkered Brown: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Plain Red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because for the phenotype, you have to consider the combination of both traits. Each gene segregates independently, so the probabilities multiply.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red: Pattern is dominant (C present), Color is dominant (B present) \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Checkered Brown: Pattern dominant, color recessive \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Plain Red: Pattern recessive, color dominant \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Plain Brown: Both recessive \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 16/16=1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 matches.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the options.\n\nOptions provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 total 16, but according to our calculation, it's 9,3,3,1\u2192 16 total.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16 \u2192 doesn't match.\n\nC. 12,2,2,2\u2192 18\u226016\n\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192 no.\n\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192 no.\n\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192 no.\n\nG.9,3,3,1\u2192 yes.\n\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192 no.\n\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192 no.\n\nSo, the correct option is G: Phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut wait, let me verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people count the number of phenotypes differently, especially if some phenotypes are identical.

The setup is about a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C, which means they have the C allele and either the B or b alleles will determine their color. Plain color is from the recessive c allele, so if both parents contribute a c, the offspring will be plain. \n\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, so any B in the genotype means they'll be red. Brown is from the recessive allele b, so only when both parents give a b will the offspring be brown.\n\nThe cross involved is between an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (so CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to make a Punnett square for the F1 generation, then look at the F2 generation to find the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, hold on. The user mentioned creating a Punnett square for the adihybridcross, but then they list all possible gametes and F1 generation. Then the options A to H follow, asking for the correct phenotypic ratio after considering the F2 generation.\n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the initial steps. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the parents:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red. So that would be CC BB.\n- Parent 2: Plain brown. That would be cc bb.\n\nSo, the F1 generation is generated by crossing these two birds. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F1 should be CC \u00d7 cc for the first gene (C and c), and BB \u00d7 bb for the second gene (B and b).\n\nBut wait, actually, when you cross CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, the F1 would receive one allele for each gene from each parent. So for the first gene (C and c):\n\nParent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 F1 gets Cc.\n\nFor the second gene (B and b):\n\nParent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 F1 gets Bb.\n\nSo the F1 individuals would all be Cc Bb.\n\nNow, the next part is to consider the F2 generation because the question asks about the F2 phenotypic ratio. But wait, the initial instructions mention making a Punnett square for the adihybridcross involving the two parents, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, etc., for the F1 and then the F2.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial statement is a bit confusing. Maybe the F1 comes from the cross of the two parents, resulting in Cc Bb, and then the F2 is derived from F1 x F1.\n\nLet me clarify the steps:\n\n1. Cross Parent 1 (CC BB) x Parent 2 (cc bb).\n   - F1 Genotype: Cc Bb\n   - Phenotype: All Cc Bb, which would display the dominant traits. Since C is dominant, and B is dominant, all would be red and brown. Wait, no\u2014let's think about the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n- Checkered pattern is C (dominant)\n- Plain color is c (recessive)\n- Red color is B (dominant)\n- Brown is b (recessive)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both the checkered pattern and the color.\n\nWait, perhaps each bird has a combination of these traits. Each gene contributes to the trait independently? Or do they work together?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes.\n\nWait, the problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, plain by c, red by B, brown by b.\n\nPerhaps the phenotype is determined by whether the bird is checkered (C) or plain (c), and also whether it's red (B) or brown (b).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So each bird's phenotype can be described by the presence of dominant alleles in both checkered and color genes.\n\nSo, for example, a bird with the C checkered pattern and B red color (CB) would be red and checkered. Similarly, CB would mean red checkered, while cb would mean brown plain, regardless of the checkered pattern.\n\nWait, but the initial description says \"checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the color is determined by c, meaning that only when both the checkered pattern and the color are non-recessive (i.e., not c) would the bird be present.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the possible phenotypes.\n\nEach bird has two copies of the checkered gene (C) and two copies of the color gene (B). So, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CC (homozygous checkered) and BB (homozygous red): Phenotype: checkered red.\n- CC and Bb: Phenotype: checkered brown.\n- CC and bb: Phenotype: plain brown.\n- Cc and BB: Phenotype: checkered red.\n- Cc and Bb: Phenotype: checkered brown.\n- Cc and bb: Phenotype: plain brown.\n- cc and BB: Phenotype: plain red.\n- cc and Bb: Phenotype: checkered red.\n- cc and bb: Phenotype: plain brown.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, since the checkered pattern is C (dominant) and plain is c, the presence of C means it's checkered, and the presence of B means it's red, and the absence of b (or presence of B) determines the color. Hmm, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, maybe each trait is independent. So the checkered pattern is determined by the presence of at least one dominant C allele, and the color is determined by having at least one dominant B allele.\n\nIn that case, the phenotype would depend on both traits. However, the problem states that checkered is C (dominant), plain is c (recessive). So presence of C = checkered, c = plain. Similarly, B = red, b = brown.\n\nSo, combining both, the phenotype would be:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: Checkered red.\n- If C is present and B absent (i.e., b present): Checkered brown.\n- If C absent (c) and B present: Plain red.\n- If C absent and B absent: Plain brown.\n\nThat makes more sense. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each trait.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (Cc \u00d7 Bb)\n2. Checkered brown (Cc \u00d7 bb)\n3. Plain red (cc \u00d7 Bb)\n4. Plain brown (cc \u00d7 bb)\n\nNow, the initial cross is between Parent 1 (CC BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb). Let's see what F1 looks like.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\nParent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 Cc.\n\nFor the second gene (B and b):\nParent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 Bb.\n\nThus, F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from F1 x F1. Each F1 individual is Cc Bb. When crossed, each gene segregates independently.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nFor the C locus (dominant C, recessive c):\nPossible gametes: C and c, each with 50% chance.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus (dominant B, recessive b):\nPossible gametes: B and b, each with 50% chance.\n\nCombining them, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C:\nCC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall F2 phenotypes can be calculated by considering all combinations.\n\nPhenotype probabilities:\n\nCheckered red (Cc \u00d7 Bb): Occurs when both C and B are present. So CC \u00d7 BB (25%), CC \u00d7 Bb (50%), Cc \u00d7 BB (50%), Cc \u00d7 Bb (25%). Total probability: 25% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 150%, which doesn't add up. Wait, that's impossible. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each gene is independent, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nCheckered red: C present and B present. Probability: (C present) * (B present) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%.\n\nWait, no, because each gene has a 50% chance of being dominant. Wait, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the phenotype.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\nProbability of C present (C or Cc): 75% (since cc is 25%).\n\nProbability of B present (B or Bb): 75% (since bb is 25%).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability of both being present (Checkered red) is 75% * 75% = 56.25%.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nCheckered brown (C present and bb): 75% * 25% = 18.75%.\n\nPlain red (cc and B present): 25% * 75% = 18.75%.\n\nPlain brown (cc and bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nAdding these up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%. Good.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 6.25%\n\nConverting to ratios, multiply by 16 (to eliminate decimals):\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25 * 16 = 900/16 \u2248 56.25 \u2192 900 parts\nWait, no. To express as a ratio without percentages, let's use fractions:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25 / 100 = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 18.75 / 100 = 3/16\n- Plain red: 18.75 / 100 = 3/16\n- Plain brown: 6.25 / 100 = 1/16\n\nWait, that adds up to 16 parts, with Checkered red being 9, others being 3, 3, 1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps my calculation was wrong. Let me re-calculate.\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of dominant (present) and 50% recessive.\n\nThe phenotype depends on both genes:\n\n- Checkered red: Both dominant \u2192 (probability for C dominant) * (probability for B dominant) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n\n- Plain red: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n\n- Plain brown: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nSo the ratios are 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25.\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n\nSame for the other 18.75 / 6.25 = 3, and 6.25 / 6.25 = 1.\n\nSo the simplified ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWhich corresponds to option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014that's inverted. Because 9 is the highest number.\n\nWait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.4,4,4,4\n\nL.1,3,9,3 (which is option D)\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option K (if K is 9,3,3,1). Looking back at the options:\n\nYes, option K is 9,3,3,1.\n\nBut none of the options seem to have that exactly. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, presence of B means red, and presence of b means brown.\n\nBut the presence of dominant alleles in both checkered and color is needed for the phenotype.\n\nSo, if a bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it's Checkered Red.\n\nIf it has C (checkered) and b (brown), it's Checkered Brown.\n\nIf it has c (plain) and B (red), it's Plain Red.\n\nIf it has c and b, it's Plain Brown.\n\nSo, yes, the four phenotypes are correctly identified.\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning Checkered Red is 9 parts, Checkered Brown 3, Plain Red 3, Plain Brown 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option K is 9,3,3,1, which fits.\n\nWait, but the options are labeled from A to L, with each letter representing an option. So, if K is an option, that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the calculations once more.\n\nTotal phenotypic possibilities:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75% C and 75% B \u2192 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n- Checkered Brown: 75% C and 25% B \u2192 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n- Plain Red: 25% C and 75% B \u2192 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n- Plain Brown: 25% C and 25% B \u2192 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nTotal: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, correct.\n\nSimplified ratio: 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25.\n\nDivide each by 6.25: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nSo, Checkered Red:9, Checkered Brown:3, Plain Red:3, Plain Brown:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option K is 9,3,3,1, which matches.\n\nWait, but none of the options say 9,3,3,1. Let me check again.\n\nOh, option K is 9,3,3,1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me look at the original problem statement again. It mentions checking the F2 generation. Did I miss anything?\n\nNo, the initial cross is between CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). The F1 is Cc Bb, and the F2 comes from F1 x F1.\n\nYes, so the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option K: 9,3,3,1.\n\nBut wait, in the initial problem, the options are labeled A to J, each with different numbers.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves two birds that are crossed, and we're looking at their traits based on certain genes. The setup is about a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C, which means they have the C allele and either the B or b alleles will determine their color. Plain color is from the recessive c allele, so if both parents contribute a c, the offspring will be plain. \n\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, so any B in the genotype means they'll be red. Brown is from the recessive allele b, so only when both parents give a b will the offspring be brown.\n\nThe cross involved is between an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (so CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to make a Punnett square for the F1 generation, then look at the F2 generation to find the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, hold on. The user mentioned creating a Punnett square for the adihybridcross, but then they list all possible gametes and F1 generation. Then the options A to H follow, asking for the correct phenotypic ratio after considering the F2 generation.\n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the initial steps. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the parents:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red. So that would be CC BB.\n- Parent 2: Plain brown. That would be cc bb.\n\nSo, the F1 generation is generated by crossing these two birds. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F1 should be CC \u00d7 cc for the first gene (C and c), and BB \u00d7 bb for the second gene (B and b).\n\nBut wait, actually, when you cross CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, the F1 would receive one allele for each gene from each parent. So for the first gene (C and c):\n\nParent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 F1 gets Cc.\n\nFor the second gene (B and b):\n\nParent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 F1 gets Bb.\n\nSo the F1 individuals would all be Cc Bb.\n\nNow, the next part is to consider the F2 generation because the question asks about the F2 phenotypic ratio. But wait, the initial instructions mention making a Punnett square for the adihybridcross involving the two parents, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, etc., for the F1 and then the F2.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial statement is a bit confusing. Maybe the F1 comes from the cross of the two parents, resulting in Cc Bb, and then the F2 is derived from F1 x F1.\n\nLet me clarify the steps:\n\n1. Cross Parent 1 (CC BB) x Parent 2 (cc bb).\n   - F1 Genotype: Cc Bb\n   - Phenotype: All Cc Bb, which would display the dominant traits. Since C is dominant, and B is dominant, all would be red and brown. Wait, no\u2014let's think about the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n- Checkered pattern is C (dominant)\n- Plain color is c (recessive)\n- Red color is B (dominant)\n- Brown is b (recessive)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both the checkered pattern and the color.\n\nWait, perhaps each bird has a combination of these traits. Each gene contributes to the trait independently? Or do they work together?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes.\n\nWait, the problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, plain by c, red by B, brown by b.\n\nPerhaps the phenotype is determined by whether the bird is checkered (C) or plain (c), and also whether it's red (B) or brown (b).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So each bird's phenotype can be described by the presence of dominant alleles in both checkered and color genes.\n\nSo, for example, a bird with the C checkered pattern and B red color (CB) would be red and checkered. Similarly, CB would mean red checkered, while cb would mean brown plain, regardless of the checkered pattern.\n\nWait, but the initial description says \"checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the color is determined by c, meaning that only when both the checkered pattern and the color are non-recessive (i.e., not c) would the bird be present.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the possible phenotypes.\n\nEach bird has two copies of the checkered gene (C) and two copies of the color gene (B). So, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CC (homozygous checkered) and BB (homozygous red): Phenotype: checkered red.\n- CC and Bb: Phenotype: checkered brown.\n- CC and bb: Phenotype: plain brown.\n- Cc and BB: Phenotype: checkered red.\n- Cc and Bb: Phenotype: checkered brown.\n- Cc and bb: Phenotype: plain brown.\n- cc and BB: Phenotype: plain red.\n- cc and Bb: Phenotype: checkered red.\n- cc and bb: Phenotype: plain brown.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, since the checkered pattern is C (dominant) and plain is c, the presence of C means it's checkered, and the presence of B means it's red, and the absence of b (or presence of B) determines the color. Hmm, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, maybe each trait is independent. So the checkered pattern is determined by the presence of at least one dominant C allele, and the color is determined by having at least one dominant B allele.\n\nIn that case, the phenotype would depend on both traits. However, the problem states that checkered is C (dominant), plain is c (recessive). So presence of C = checkered, c = plain. Similarly, B = red, b = brown.\n\nSo, combining both, the phenotype would be:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: Checkered red.\n- If C is present and B absent (i.e., b present): Checkered brown.\n- If C absent (c) and B present: Plain red.\n- If C absent and B absent: Plain brown.\n\nThat makes more sense. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each trait.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (Cc \u00d7 Bb)\n2. Checkered brown (Cc \u00d7 bb)\n3. Plain red (cc \u00d7 Bb)\n4. Plain brown (cc \u00d7 bb)\n\nNow, the initial cross is between Parent 1 (CC BB) and Parent 2 (cc bb). Let's see what F1 looks like.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\nParent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 Cc.\n\nFor the second gene (B and b):\nParent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 Bb.\n\nThus, F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from F1 x F1. Each F1 individual is Cc Bb. When crossed, each gene segregates independently.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nFor the C locus (dominant C, recessive c):\nPossible gametes: C and c, each with 50% chance.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus (dominant B, recessive b):\nPossible gametes: B and b, each with 50% chance.\n\nCombining them, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C:\nCC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall F2 phenotypes can be calculated by considering all combinations.\n\nPhenotype probabilities:\n\nCheckered red (Cc \u00d7 Bb): Occurs when both C and B are present. So CC \u00d7 BB (25%), CC \u00d7 Bb (50%), Cc \u00d7 BB (50%), Cc \u00d7 Bb (25%). Total probability: 25% + 50% + 50% + 25% = 150%, which doesn't add up. Wait, that's impossible. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each gene is independent, so the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nCheckered red: C present and B present. Probability: (C present) * (B present) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%.\n\nWait, no, because each gene has a 50% chance of being dominant. Wait, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the phenotype.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\nProbability of C present (C or Cc): 75% (since cc is 25%).\n\nProbability of B present (B or Bb): 75% (since bb is 25%).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability of both being present (Checkered red) is 75% * 75% = 56.25%.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nCheckered brown (C present and bb): 75% * 25% = 18.75%.\n\nPlain red (cc and B present): 25% * 75% = 18.75%.\n\nPlain brown (cc and bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nAdding these up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%. Good.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 6.25%\n\nConverting to ratios, multiply by 16 (to eliminate decimals):\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25 * 16 = 900/16 \u2248 56.25 \u2192 900 parts\nWait, no. To express as a ratio without percentages, let's use fractions:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25 / 100 = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 18.75 / 100 = 3/16\n- Plain red: 18.75 / 100 = 3/16\n- Plain brown: 6.25 / 100 = 1/16\n\nWait, that adds up to 16 parts, with Checkered red being 9, others being 3, 3, 1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps my calculation was wrong. Let me re-calculate.\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of dominant (present) and 50% recessive.\n\nThe phenotype depends on both genes:\n\n- Checkered red: Both dominant \u2192 (probability for C dominant) * (probability for B dominant) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n\n- Plain red: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n\n- Plain brown: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nSo the ratios are 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25.\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n\nSame for the other 18.75 / 6.25 = 3, and 6.25 / 6.25 = 1.\n\nSo the simplified ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWhich corresponds to option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014that's inverted. Because 9 is the highest number.\n\nWait, let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.4,4,4,4\n\nL.1,3,9,3 (which is option D)\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option K (if K is 9,3,3,1).

So, if K is an option, that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the calculations once more.\n\nTotal phenotypic possibilities:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75% C and 75% B \u2192 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n- Checkered Brown: 75% C and 25% B \u2192 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n- Plain Red: 25% C and 75% B \u2192 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n- Plain Brown: 25% C and 25% B \u2192 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nTotal: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, correct.\n\nSimplified ratio: 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25.\n\nDivide each by 6.25: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nSo, Checkered Red:9, Checkered Brown:3, Plain Red:3, Plain Brown:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option K is 9,3,3,1, which matches.\n\nWait, but none of the options say 9,3,3,1. Let me check again.\n\nOh, option K is 9,3,3,1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me look at the original problem statement again. It mentions checking the F2 generation. Did I miss anything?\n\nNo, the initial cross is between CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). The F1 is Cc Bb, and the F2 comes from F1 x F1.\n\nYes, so the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option K: 9,3,3,1.\n\nBut wait, in the initial problem, the options are labeled A to J, each with different numbers. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, the user listed the options as:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nK. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nL. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nSo, option K is indeed 9,3,3,1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option K.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Their offspring are going through an F2 generation based on a Punnett square. We need to determine the phenotypic ratios for each trait\u2014red, brown, blue (wait, no, there's no blue mentioned here), or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, it says the patterns are controlled by genes C and c (C dominant for pigmentation, c recessive). The colors are B (dominant) for red and b for brown. So, we're dealing with two traits: pigment color (red vs. brown) and pattern (checkered vs. plain).\n\nThe parents are CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (homozygous plain brown). Since both are homozygous, their offspring will be predictable in terms of genotype ratios without considering blending (like in F1), but since they're asking about F2, which comes from F1, we'll need to go through that.\n\nFirst, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 all C and B alleles present.\n   - Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 all c and b alleles present.\n\n2. Determine the possible gametes each parent can produce.\n   - Parent 1 can only produce gametes with CB because CC and BB are homozygous.\n   - Parent 2 can only produce gametes with cb because cc and bb are homozygous.\n\n3. Create the F1 generation by combining the gametes:\n   - Each F1 bird gets one allele from each parent.\n   - So, F1 genotype would be CcBb because the parents contribute CB and cb respectively.\n\nNow, the F1 flies (CcBb) will self-pollinate to form the F2 generation.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, I need to consider the combination of two independently assorting genes: pigment color (B/b) and pattern (C/c). \n\nBut wait, do these genes assort independently? In many cases, yes, especially when the traits are not linked. Since the problem doesn't mention any linkage between these genes, I'll assume they assort independently.\n\nSo, let's break down the F1 (CcBb) into its components:\n\n- For the pigment color (B/b):\n  - C is dominant, so presence of C means B (red).\n  - c is recessive, so presence of c means b (brown).\n\n- For the pattern (C/c):\n  - C is dominant, so presence of C means checkered.\n  - c is recessive, so presence of c means plain.\n\nEach gene is segregating independently, so we'll calculate the probabilities for each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me first compute the probability distribution for the pigment color (B/b):\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), each bird has one C and one c allele. Since C is dominant, the probability of expressing B (red) is 100% because even if both alleles were c, it would still express b as brown. Wait, no, actually, in F1, each bird has one C and one c. So, each bird has a 50% chance of being Cc (which expresses red) and 50% chance of being cc (which expresses brown). But since the parents are all C and B, perhaps I should think again.\n\nWait, actually, the F1 is CcBb, meaning each bird has one C and one c, and one B and one b. So, the pigment color (B/b) in F1 would be expressed as follows:\n\n- For each bird, the possibility of having one B and one b allele. So, the probability of having B (expressing red) is 50%, same for b (brown).\n\nSimilarly, for the pattern (C/c):\n\n- Each bird has one C and one c allele. So, 50% chance of being C (checkered) and 50% chance of being c (plain).\n\nSince these two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nWait, but the options given don't seem to match this straightforward approach. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, let me correct myself. The parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). When crossed, F1 will be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), each bird has:\n\n- Pigment color: C/B (since C is dominant)\n- Pattern: c/b\n\nSo, for pigment color (B/b):\n\n- 50% chance of B (red)\n- 50% chance of b (brown)\n\nFor pattern (C/c):\n\n- 50% chance of C (checkered)\n- 50% chance of c (plain)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combinations are:\n\n- Checkered red (C and B): 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Checkered brown (C and b): 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Plain red (c and B): 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Plain brown (c and b): 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nWait, but in reality, some of these might not make sense because the parents are all C and B for pigment and all c and b for pattern. So, perhaps the F1 will always be CcBb, leading to F2 where each trait is determined independently.\n\nWait, but the initial assumption is that the genes are independent, so the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 25% each for the four possible phenotypes.\n\nHowever, the answer choices don't include equal ratios like 1:1:1:1. They all sum up to different totals. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming independence. Alternatively, perhaps the genes are linked, affecting the segregation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler than that. Perhaps the F2 generation refers to the second generation after the first cross, but starting from F1.\n\nWait, the problem states \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits. So, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross between CCBB and ccbb, resulting in F1 (CcBb), which then selfs to form F2.\n\nSo, F2 will consist of all possible combinations of the F1 alleles. As I thought earlier, each trait is determined independently.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, 25% plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which suggests a tripling due to dominance, but that might be if the parents were different.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the genes aren't independent. If the genes are linked, the segregation would not be 1/4 for each phenotype but instead follow a different pattern based on linkage. However, since the problem doesn't specify linkage, I'll proceed under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 using the actual F1 genotypes and their possible gametes, considering the independent assortment of two genes.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb. So, in F2, each gene segregates independently, so for pigment color (B/b), the possible gamete types are B and b, each at 50%. Similarly, for pattern (C/c), gametes are C and c, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc Bb (49%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nBut for phenotypic expression:\n\n- Cc Bb: C is dominant, B is dominant \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc bb: C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 brown checkered\n- cc Bb: c is recessive, B dominant \u2192 red plain\n- cc bb: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 brown plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red checkered: 49%\n- Brown checkered: 25%\n- Red plain: 25%\n- Brown plain: 25%\n\nAdding these up, the total percentages are 49 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 124%, which seems incorrect because probabilities should sum to 100%. This discrepancy arises because the F2 population includes all possible genotypes, including those that may not exist in reality, such as double recessives.\n\nWait, no, actually, the Punnett squares for independent assortment will indeed add up correctly because each genotype has a certain probability. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, the possible gametes are:\n\n- From Cc (pigment): B and b, each 50%\n- From cc (pattern): C and c, each 50%\n\nSo, F2 would have:\n\n- 25% Cc Bb (49% overall, since Cc is 50% and Bb is 50%)\nWait, no, the actual calculation is more precise.\n\nThe correct way is to calculate the probability of each phenotype:\n\nFor pigment color (B/b):\n\n- Probability of B (red) = 50% (from Cc) * 50% (from Bb) = 25%\n- Probability of b (brown) = 50% (from Cc) * 50% (from Bb) = 25%\n\nFor pattern (C/c):\n\n- Probability of C (checkered) = 50% (from cc) * 50% (from Cb) = 25%\n- Probability of c (plain) = 50% (from cc) * 50% (from Cb) = 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Checkered red: Cc (pigment) * Cc (pattern) \u2192 (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered brown: Cc * cc \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n3. Plain red: cc * Cc \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. Plain brown: cc * cc \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, adding these gives 6.25*4=25%. Hmm, that can't be right because the F2 population should have more individuals. Wait, no, actually, in F2, the number of individuals is 16 (assuming each parent produces 4 gametes), but the proportions remain the same. So, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population.\n\nBut none of the answer options match this exact distribution. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2\n\nB. 8,4\n\nC.9,3\n\nD.1,3\n\nE.3,9\n\nF.4,4\n\nG.12,2\n\nH.5,3\n\nI.7,1\n\nJ.2,6\n\nK.4,4\n\nL.6,2\n\nM.12,2\n\nN.5,3\n\nO.7,1\n\nP.4,4\n\nQ.12,2\n\nR.5,3\n\nS.7,1\n\nT.4,4\n\nU.6,2\n\nV.4,4\n\nW.12,2\n\nX.5,3\n\nY.7,1\n\nZ.4,4\n\nHmm, option J is 2,6, which sums to 8, but our calculation shows 25%, which isn't directly listed. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the actual F1 genotypes and their possible gametes.\n\nF1 is CcBb. Itself, each bird has one C and one c, and one B and one b. So, when F1 selfs, each gene segregates independently.\n\nSo, the possible gametes from F1 are:\n\n- For pigment color (B/b): 50% B, 50% b\n- For pattern (C/c): 50% C, 50% c\n\nThus, each F2 bird will receive one allele from each gene.\n\nPhenotype expressions:\n\n- If C (C_), then pattern is C (checkered); else c (plain)\n- If B (B_), then pigment is B (red); else b (brown)\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes will be a combination of these.\n\nCalculating the possible combinations:\n\n1. CcBb: 25% (50% C/C and 50% B/B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Ccbb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. ccBb: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n4. ccbb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these contributes equally, so the phenotypic ratio is 25% each. But the options don't reflect this exactly. Let me see:\n\nIf each phenotype is represented by 25% of the population, then the ratio among them is 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and the problem expects us to consider dominance differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the F1's genotype is not CcBb but something else. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Cc Bb (because CC is homozygous dominant for C, and BB is dominant for B. So, each bird has one C and one B allele.)\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 each bird has one c and one b allele.\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 is CcBb (each bird gets one C and one c, and one B and one b).\n\nYes, so F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs:\n\nEach bird can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- For pigment color (B/b): 50% B, 50% b\n- For pattern (C/c): 50% C, 50% c\n\nThus, each F2 bird has four possible combinations of these gametes:\n\n1. B and C \u2192 CcBb (Checkered red)\n2. B and c \u2192 Ccbb (Checkered brown)\n3. b and C \u2192 ccBb (Plain red)\n4. b and c \u2192 ccbb (Plain brown)\n\nEach of these four combinations occurs at 25% frequency.\n\nSo, each phenotype is 25% of the population, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the answer options don't show 1:1:1:1. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, possibly considering dominance.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering dominance, i.e., in F1, some genotypes are not viable. For example, if C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, then in F1, some genotypes might not appear because they are not heterozygous. But in this case, F1 is CcBb, which is fully dominant, so all four combinations are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the F2 generation in terms of the expected phenotypic ratio, regardless of dominance, which would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match this.\n\nWait, looking at option K: phenotypic ratio 5,3, which adds to 8. Option V: 4,4, adding to 8. Option Y: 7,1, adding to 8. Option Z: 4,4, same as V.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should construct the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nF1 is CcBb. Each bird has one C and one c, and one B and one b.\n\nSo, F1's gametes are:\n\n- For C (pigment): 50% C, 50% c\n- For B (color): 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, each F1 bird can produce gametes:\n\n1. CB\n2. Cb\n3. cB\n4. cb\n\nEach of these gametes has a 25% chance of occurring.\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four types of birds:\n\n1. CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. Cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb \u2192 CcBb\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because each bird combines two gametes\u2014one for pigment and one for pattern.\n\nWait, no, each bird in F2 receives one allele from each parent for each gene. So, each F2 bird is formed by one gamete from F1 (for pigment) and one gamete from another F1 (for pattern).\n\nThus, the F2 birds will have:\n\n- For pigment color: either C or c\n- For pattern: either C or c\n\nEach combination is possible.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (pigment C, pattern C)\n2. Cc (pigment C, pattern c)\n3. cC (pigment c, pattern C)\n4. cc (pigment c, pattern c)\n\nEach combination occurs at 25% frequency.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Pigment: C (C_) \u2192 red\n- Pattern: C (C_) \u2192 checkered\n- Pigment: c (cc) \u2192 brown\n- Pattern: c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of pigment and pattern:\n\n1. C (pigment) and C (pattern) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and c \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. c and C \u2192 Plain red\n4. c and c \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes occurs at 25% frequency in F2.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options don't have this. The closest option is E: phenotypic ratio 3,9, which adds to 12. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, let me recount the possibilities:\n\nEach F2 bird has a 25% chance of being in each of the four categories:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nWe have two birds crossing, one that's a dominant recombination cross (checkered red) and another that's a plain brown. Their offspring are going through an F2 generation based on a Punnett square. We need to determine the phenotypic ratios for each trait\u2014red, brown, blue (wait, no, there's no blue mentioned here), or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, it says the patterns are controlled by genes C and c (C dominant for pigmentation, c recessive). The colors are B (dominant) for red and b for brown. So, we're dealing with two traits: pigment color (red vs. brown) and pattern (checkered vs. plain).\n\nThe parents are CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (homozygous plain brown). Since both are homozygous, their offspring will be predictable in terms of genotype ratios without considering blending (like in F1), but since they're asking about F2, which comes from F1, we'll need to go through that.\n\nFirst, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 all C and B alleles present.\n   - Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 all c and b alleles present.\n\n2. Determine the possible gametes each parent can produce.\n   - Parent 1 can only produce gametes with CB because CC and BB are homozygous.\n   - Parent 2 can only produce gametes with cb because cc and bb are homozygous.\n\n3. Create the F1 generation by combining the gametes:\n   - Each F1 bird gets one allele from each parent.\n   - So, F1 genotype would be CcBb because the parents contribute CB and cb respectively.\n\nNow, the F1 flies (CcBb) will self-pollinate to form the F2 generation.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, I need to consider the combination of two independently assorting genes: pigment color (B/b) and pattern (C/c). \n\nBut wait, do these genes assort independently? In many cases, yes, especially when the traits are not linked. Since the problem doesn't mention any linkage between these genes, I'll assume they assort independently.\n\nSo, let's break down the F1 (CcBb) into its components:\n\n- For the pigment color (B/b):\n  - C is dominant, so presence of C means B (red).\n  - c is recessive, so presence of c means b (brown).\n\n- For the pattern (C/c):\n  - C is dominant, so presence of C means checkered.\n  - c is recessive, so presence of c means plain.\n\nEach gene is segregating independently, so we'll calculate the probabilities for each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me first compute the probability distribution for the pigment color (B/b):\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), each bird has one C and one c allele. Since C is dominant, the probability of expressing B (red) is 100% because even if both alleles were c, it would still express b as brown. Wait, no, actually, in F1, each bird has one C and one c. So, each bird has a 50% chance of being Cc (which expresses red) and 50% chance of being cc (which expresses brown). But since the parents are all C and B, perhaps I should think again.\n\nWait, actually, the F1 is CcBb, meaning each bird has one C and one c, and one B and one b. So, the pigment color (B/b) in F1 would be expressed as follows:\n\n- For each bird, the possibility of having one B and one b allele. So, the probability of having B (expressing red) is 50%, same for b (brown).\n\nSimilarly, for the pattern (C/c):\n\n- Each bird has one C and one c allele. So, 50% chance of being C (checkered) and 50% chance of being c (plain).\n\nSince these two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nWait, but the options given don't seem to match this straightforward approach. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, let me correct myself. The parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). When crossed, F1 will be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), each bird has:\n\n- Pigment color: C/B (since C is dominant)\n- Pattern: c/b\n\nSo, for pigment color (B/b):\n\n- 50% chance of B (red)\n- 50% chance of b (brown)\n\nFor pattern (C/c):\n\n- 50% chance of C (checkered)\n- 50% chance of c (plain)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combinations are:\n\n- Checkered red (C and B): 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Checkered brown (C and b): 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Plain red (c and B): 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Plain brown (c and b): 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nWait, but in reality, some of these might not make sense because the parents are all C and B for pigment and all c and b for pattern. So, perhaps the F1 will always be CcBb, leading to F2 where each trait is determined independently.\n\nWait, but the initial assumption is that the genes are independent, so the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 25% each for the four possible phenotypes.\n\nHowever, the answer choices don't include equal ratios like 1:1:1:1. They all sum up to different totals. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming independence. Alternatively, perhaps the genes are linked, affecting the segregation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler than that. Perhaps the F2 generation refers to the second generation after the first cross, but starting from F1.\n\nWait, the problem states \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits. So, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross between CCBB and ccbb, resulting in F1 (CcBb), which then selfs to form F2.\n\nSo, F2 will consist of all possible combinations of the F1 alleles. As I thought earlier, each trait is determined independently.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, 25% plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which suggests a tripling due to dominance, but that might be if the parents were different.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the genes aren't independent. If the genes are linked, the segregation would not be 1/4 for each phenotype but instead follow a different pattern based on linkage. However, since the problem doesn't specify linkage, I'll proceed under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 using the actual F1 genotypes and their possible gametes, considering the independent assortment of two genes.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb. So, in F2, each gene segregates independently, so for pigment color (B/b), the possible gamete types are B and b, each at 50%. Similarly, for pattern (C/c), gametes are C and c, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc Bb (49%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nBut for phenotypic expression:\n\n- Cc Bb: C is dominant, B is dominant \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc bb: C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 brown checkered\n- cc Bb: c is recessive, B dominant \u2192 red plain\n- cc bb: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 brown plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red checkered: 49%\n- Brown checkered: 25%\n- Red plain: 25%\n- Brown plain: 25%\n\nAdding these up, the total percentages are 49 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 124%, which seems incorrect because probabilities should sum to 100%. This discrepancy arises because the F2 population includes all possible genotypes, including those that may not exist in reality, such as double recessives.\n\nWait, no, actually, the Punnett squares for independent assortment will indeed add up correctly because each genotype has a certain probability. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, the possible gametes are:\n\n- From Cc (pigment): B and b, each 50%\n- From cc (pattern): C and c, each 50%\n\nSo, F2 would have:\n\n- 25% Cc Bb (49% overall, since Cc is 50% and Bb is 50%)\nWait, no, the actual calculation is more precise.\n\nThe correct way is to calculate the probability of each phenotype:\n\nFor pigment color (B/b):\n\n- Probability of B (red) = 50% (from Cc) * 50% (from Bb) = 25%\n- Probability of b (brown) = 50% (from Cc) * 50% (from Bb) = 25%\n\nFor pattern (C/c):\n\n- Probability of C (checkered) = 50% (from cc) * 50% (from Cb) = 25%\n- Probability of c (plain) = 50% (from cc) * 50% (from Cb) = 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Checkered red: Cc (pigment) * Cc (pattern) \u2192 (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered brown: Cc * cc \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n3. Plain red: cc * Cc \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n4. Plain brown: cc * cc \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, adding these gives 6.25*4=25%. Hmm, that can't be right because the F2 population should have more individuals. Wait, no, actually, in F2, the number of individuals is 16 (assuming each parent produces 4 gametes), but the proportions remain the same. So, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population.\n\nBut none of the answer options match this exact distribution. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2\n\nB. 8,4\n\nC.9,3\n\nD.1,3\n\nE.3,9\n\nF.4,4\n\nG.12,2\n\nH.5,3\n\nI.7,1\n\nJ.2,6\n\nK.4,4\n\nL.6,2\n\nM.12,2\n\nN.5,3\n\nO.7,1\n\nP.4,4\n\nQ.12,2\n\nR.5,3\n\nS.7,1\n\nT.4,4\n\nU.6,2\n\nV.4,4\n\nW.12,2\n\nX.5,3\n\nY.7,1\n\nZ.4,4\n\nHmm, option J is 2,6, which sums to 8, but our calculation shows 25%, which isn't directly listed. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the actual F1 genotypes and their possible gametes.\n\nF1 is CcBb. Itself, each bird has one C and one c, and one B and one b. So, when F1 selfs, each gene segregates independently.\n\nSo, the possible gametes from F1 are:\n\n- For pigment color (B/b): 50% B, 50% b\n- For pattern (C/c): 50% C, 50% c\n\nThus, each F2 bird will receive one allele from each gene.\n\nPhenotype expressions:\n\n- If C (C_), then pattern is C (checkered); else c (plain)\n- If B (B_), then pigment is B (red); else b (brown)\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes will be a combination of these.\n\nCalculating the possible combinations:\n\n1. CcBb: 25% (50% C/C and 50% B/B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Ccbb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. ccBb: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n4. ccbb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these contributes equally, so the phenotypic ratio is 25% each. But the options don't reflect this exactly. Let me see:\n\nIf each phenotype is represented by 25% of the population, then the ratio among them is 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and the problem expects us to consider dominance differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the F1's genotype is not CcBb but something else. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Cc Bb (because CC is homozygous dominant for C, and BB is dominant for B. So, each bird has one C and one B allele.)\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 each bird has one c and one b allele.\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 is CcBb (each bird gets one C and one c, and one B and one b).\n\nYes, so F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs:\n\nEach bird can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- For pigment color (B/b): 50% B, 50% b\n- For pattern (C/c): 50% C, 50% c\n\nThus, each F2 bird has four possible combinations of these gametes:\n\n1. B and C \u2192 CcBb (Checkered red)\n2. B and c \u2192 Ccbb (Checkered brown)\n3. b and C \u2192 ccBb (Plain red)\n4. b and c \u2192 ccbb (Plain brown)\n\nEach of these four combinations occurs at 25% frequency.\n\nSo, each phenotype is 25% of the population, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the answer options don't show 1:1:1:1. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, possibly considering dominance.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering dominance, i.e., in F1, some genotypes are not viable. For example, if C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, then in F1, some genotypes might not appear because they are not heterozygous. But in this case, F1 is CcBb, which is fully dominant, so all four combinations are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the F2 generation in terms of the expected phenotypic ratio, regardless of dominance, which would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match this.\n\nWait, looking at option K: phenotypic ratio 5,3, which adds to 8. Option V: 4,4, adding to 8. Option Y: 7,1, adding to 8. Option Z: 4,4, same as V.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should construct the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nF1 is CcBb. Each bird has one C and one c, and one B and one b.\n\nSo, F1's gametes are:\n\n- For C (pigment): 50% C, 50% c\n- For B (color): 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, each F1 bird can produce gametes:\n\n1. CB\n2. Cb\n3. cB\n4. cb\n\nEach of these gametes has a 25% chance of occurring.\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four types of birds:\n\n1. CB \u2192 CcBb\n2. Cb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cb \u2192 CcBb\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because each bird combines two gametes\u2014one for pigment and one for pattern.\n\nWait, no, each bird in F2 receives one allele from each parent for each gene. So, each F2 bird is formed by one gamete from F1 (for pigment) and one gamete from another F1 (for pattern).\n\nThus, the F2 birds will have:\n\n- For pigment color: either C or c\n- For pattern: either C or c\n\nEach combination is possible.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (pigment C, pattern C)\n2. Cc (pigment C, pattern c)\n3. cC (pigment c, pattern C)\n4. cc (pigment c, pattern c)\n\nEach combination occurs at 25% frequency.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Pigment: C (C_) \u2192 red\n- Pattern: C (C_) \u2192 checkered\n- Pigment: c (cc) \u2192 brown\n- Pattern: c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of pigment and pattern:\n\n1. C (pigment) and C (pattern) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and c \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. c and C \u2192 Plain red\n4. c and c \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes occurs at 25% frequency in F2.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options don't have this. The closest option is E: phenotypic ratio 3,9, which adds to 12. That's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, let me recount the possibilities:\n\nEach F2 bird has a 25% chance of being in each of the four categories:\n\n1. C (pigment) and C (pattern",

    "chunk_resampled": "Let me read it again.",
    "rollout": " Let me read it again.\n\nThe question involves a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is governed by another dominant gene B, while brown is determined by the recessive allele b. We're supposed to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). Then, we need to determine the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, hold on. The user provided some initial steps but got confused in the middle. Let me start over.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the genes involved here:\n\n- Gene C: controls the checkered pattern. Dominant allele C leads to checkered color, recessive c results in plain.\n- Gene B: determines red or brown color. Dominant B makes it red, recessive b makes it brown.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. Since these are independent, we'll consider both genes separately and then combine them for the F2 generation.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions adihybrid cross, which usually refers to crossing dihybrids. So, perhaps each parent is a dihybrid, meaning they have both genes expressed. But in this case, one parent is homozygous for both genes (CCBB), and the other is homozygous for both (ccbb).\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the other bird is plain brown, so ccbb would mean both genes are recessive (for B and b). Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me see: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" is CCBB, which means both B and B alleles. And the other bird is plain brown, so it must be bb for the B locus (since B is dominant for red) and b for the b locus (so the other gene, which is b, determines brown color). Wait, no\u2014plain is from c, which is recessive. So, if the bird is plain brown, its genotype must be cc for the B locus (since B is dominant for red, and brown is recessive) and bb for the b locus (since brown is dominant for that gene? Wait, no\u2014the other bird is plain brown, meaning it's not showing the dominant phenotype for either gene. So, for the first gene (C), it's C (homozygous), and for the second gene (B), since it's plain, it must be bb (because B is dominant for red, so if it were BB, it would be red). Similarly, for the b gene, being plain brown implies that it's bb (since brown is recessive for that gene).\n\nWait, no\u2014that seems contradictory. Because the bird is plain brown, which would mean for gene B it's bb (brown is recessive), and for gene b it's also bb (since brown is recessive there as well). So the other bird's genotype is ccbb for both genes.\n\nNow, the cross is between CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (homozygous plain brown).\n\nTo find the F1 generation, we'd look at the possible gametes each parent can produce. However, the user already went through the process and created an incorrect F1 list. Instead of CB and cb, which might be wrong, probably they should have considered all possible gametes based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nLet me correct that approach.\n\nFor the CCBB parent:\n- Genotype: C C B B\n- All four alleles are present, so possible gametes are CB and CB, but since the alleles are the same, the gametes will be CB regardless of order. So, only one type of gamete: CB.\n\nFor the ccbb parent:\n- Genotype: c c b b\n- Possible gametes: cb or bc, but since order doesn't matter, they'll all be cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these gametes. So F1 would have two types of birds:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (but since both parents give CB and cb, the offspring would have either CB or cb, depending on which gamete they receive.)\n\nWait, actually, each parent gives one gamete. So the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CCBB: CB\nFrom ccbb: cb\n\nSo F1 genotypes are CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous, the F1 will all be CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the parents are CCBB and ccbb, their gametes are CB and cb, respectively. So when they mate, all offspring will get one allele from each parent: C from CCBB and c from ccbb, and B from CCBB and b from ccbb. So all F1 will be CcBb.\n\nThus, F1 is 100% CcBb.\n\nNow, moving to F2 generation. The F1 will self-pollinate. So, we need to perform a dihybrid cross for F1 (CcBb x CcBb).\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, we calculate probabilities for each combination of alleles. For each gene, the probability of C and c is 0.5 each. Since the genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities.\n\nEach gene independently contributes 25% chance for each combination.\n\nFor example, for the B locus, each F1 bird is Bb. So when crossed, the possible outcomes for B are B and b, each with 25% and 50%, etc., but more accurately, for each gene, the F1 has a 25% chance of each genotype.\n\nWait, better way: Each gene is independently assorting. So for each gene, the F1 bird is Bb (since it's CcBb: C is dominant, so C is present, and B is present as Bb). Therefore, for each gene, the F1 bird is Bb.\n\nWhen F1 (Bb) is crossed with F1 (Bb), the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the b gene, each bird is bb (from Bb). So when crossed, the possible bb (25%), Bb (50%), and BB (25%) for the b gene.\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities. So for each gene, 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nPutting it together, for both genes:\n\n- BB (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- Bb (25% \u00d7 50% + 50% \u00d7 25% = 25% + 25% = 50%)\n- bb (50% \u00d7 50% = 25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the F1 bird is Bb, so each gene's F1 is Bb, which is a 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSo for each gene:\n\nProbability of BB = 25%\nProbability of Bb = 50%\nProbability of bb = 25%\n\nThen, for both genes:\n\nThe combined probabilities are calculated using multiplication since the genes are independent.\n\nSo:\n\n- Probability of BB (both B and b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Probability of Bb (either B or b for one gene, and the other gene is anything else): Let's think differently. For each gene, the possibilities are BB, Bb, bb. For two genes, each gene's outcome is independent. So the total number of possible combinations is 3x3=9.\n\nOut of these 9, how many correspond to each phenotype?\n\nPhenotype depends on the alleles:\n\n- BB: Checkered red\n- Bb: Checkered brown\n- bb: Plain red (since B is dominant for red)\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether it has at least one dominant allele for B (i.e., B) or not.\n\nWait, no: the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n- Gene C: dominant C \u2192 checkered; recessive c \u2192 plain.\n- Gene B: dominant B \u2192 red; recessive b \u2192 brown.\n\nSo each bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles present for each gene. For example, if a bird is CCBB, it's checkered red. If it's CCbb, it's checkered brown. If it's ccBB, it's plain red. If it's ccbb, it's plain brown.\n\nBut since the F1 birds are all Bb (as per earlier), let's focus on their B alleles.\n\nSo for each F1 bird:\n\n- If they have at least one B allele, they're brown (checkered brown).\n- If they have two b alleles, they're plain red.\n- If they have one B and one b, they're checkered brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014phenotype depends on dominant alleles. So any bird with B (dominant) will show red. Only those without B (i.e., bb) will show brown.\n\nSimilarly, for the c gene (pluripotent unless affected by C?), but C affects the color, so the presence of c does not affect color unless C is recessive. Wait, no\u2014it's about the dominance for each trait.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n- Red color: B dominant, b \u2192 brown.\n\nSo the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to different phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, for each bird, their phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, but each bird is diploid for both genes. So:\n\n- For C: dominant is C, recessive is c.\n- For B: dominant is B, recessive is b.\n\nSo a bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles for each gene.\n\nIf the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will show the corresponding phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene is independent, but the overall phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for B (B_), it will be brown (if B is dominant for red, but the color phenotype is red if B is present, otherwise brown). Wait, no\u2014the problem defines red as having B dominant, brown as recessive.\n\nSo, if a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown; if it has at least one b, it's plain red.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. No\u2014wait, the problem says:\n\nRed color is controlled by dominant allele B; plain color is recessive c. Brown color is controlled by recessive allele b.\n\nSo, if a bird has even one B allele, it's red. If it has at least one b, it's brown.\n\nSo, the phenotype for each bird is determined by the presence of B and b alleles.\n\nSimilarly, for C, it's presence of C determines checkered or plain.\n\nSo, combining both genes, the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nNow, back to the F1 generation. Since all F1 are Bb (assuming the earlier mistake was corrected), we need to determine the phenotypes for each.\n\nFor each bird, they have B and b for the B gene. So, for B:\n\n- If they have at least one B, they're brown (red is when you don't have B, i.e., if you have bb).\n- If they have at least one b, they're plain red (since brown is dominant for that trait? Or wait, no\u2014the problem says brown is recessive. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that brown is controlled by recessive allele b. So, if a bird has at least one b, it's brown. If it has none, it's plain red.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nProblem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n- Red color: B dominant, b \u2192 brown?\nWait, no\u2014the problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n- Red color: B dominant, b \u2192 red.\n- Brown color: b \u2192 brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says:\n\nCheckered pattern is C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n\nRed color is B dominant, b \u2192 brown? Or is it the opposite?\n\nWait, let's re-read:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, red is when B is present (since B is dominant), and brown is when b is present (recessive). Similarly, checkered is when c is present.\n\nWait, no\u2014the first part says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that can't be right because typically, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, if B is dominant for red, then brown would be when b is present.\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that seems off because if B is dominant, then brown would be when b is present, which contradicts typical Mendelian traits where dominant traits are expressed. Alternatively, maybe the problem swapped the roles: perhaps B is for brown, and b is for red. That would make sense because if B is dominant, the phenotype would be brown, and red would be when b is present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let's parse it carefully:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n- Red color: B dominant, b \u2192 red? Or vice versa?\n\nNo, the problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nHmm, that suggests that B is responsible for red, and b is responsible for brown. Which is unusual because typically, the dominant allele masks the recessive effect. But according to the problem, if you have at least one B allele, you get red; if you have at least one b, you get brown.\n\nWait, but that's confusing because typically, brown is recessive for that trait. So perhaps in this context, brown is the dominant allele, and red is the recessive. That would align with standard terminology.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem inverted the roles: perhaps B is for brown, and b is for red.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that:\n\n- If a bird has at least one B allele (B_), it gets red.\n- If it has at least one b allele (b_), it gets brown.\n\nBecause the problem explicitly states that B is dominant for red and b is dominant for brown? Wait, no\u2014no, the problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! So B is responsible for red, and b is responsible for brown. But that would imply that brown is the dominant allele, which conflicts with standard Mendelian traits where dominant traits are expressed.\n\nThis could be a tricky point. Let me assume that the problem intended that B is dominant for red, and b is dominant for brown. So:\n\n- B_ \u2192 red\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nThat would make sense because then, if you have at least one B allele, you're red; if you have at least one b, you're brown.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the other way around, with B being brown and b being red, that's also possible, but given the wording, I think it's more likely that B is red and b is brown.\n\nAnyway, proceeding under this assumption.\n\nSo, for each bird, their phenotype depends on whether they have at least one B or at least one b allele.\n\nNow, the F1 generation is all Bb, so each bird is heterozygous for both genes.\n\nNow, let's compute the phenotypes for F1.\n\nSince each bird is Bb, they have a 50% chance of B and 50% chance of b for each gene.\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- 50% B_, 50% bb\n\nFor the b gene:\n\n- 50% b_, 50% B_\n\nCombined, for each bird:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, for the B gene:\n\n- If they have at least one B (i.e., B_), they are red.\n- If they have at least one b (i.e., bb), they are brown.\n\nFor the b gene:\n\n- If they have at least one b (i.e., b_), they are brown.\n- If they have at least one B (i.e., B_), they are red.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. The presence of at least one dominant allele for a gene determines the phenotype.\n\nSo for the B gene:\n\n- B_: red\n- bb: brown\n\nFor the b gene:\n\n- b_: brown\n- B_: red\n\nBut the presence of either dominant allele for a gene determines the phenotype.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird has alleles for both genes. So, a bird can have B and b for one gene and B and b for the other. Wait, no\u2014they have two alleles for each gene, so for B, they have one allele, and for b, they have another.\n\nWait, no\u2014the bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for the B gene, one allele, and for the b gene, another.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- They have two alleles for B and two for b.\n\nWait, no\u2014in dihybrid crosses, each bird has two alleles for each gene.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question involves a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is governed by another dominant gene B, while brown is determined by the recessive allele b. We're supposed to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). Then, we need to determine the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, hold on. The user provided some initial steps but got confused in the middle. Let me start over.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the genes involved here:\n\n- Gene C: controls the checkered pattern. Dominant allele C leads to checkered color, recessive c results in plain.\n- Gene B: determines red or brown color. Dominant B makes it red, recessive b makes it brown.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. Since these are independent, we'll consider both genes separately and then combine them for the F2 generation.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions adihybrid cross, which usually refers to crossing dihybrids. So, perhaps each parent is a dihybrid, meaning they have both genes expressed. But in this case, one parent is homozygous for both genes (CCBB), and the other is homozygous for both (ccbb).\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the other bird is plain brown, so ccbb would mean both genes are recessive (for B and b). Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me see: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" is CCBB, which means both B and B alleles. And the other bird is plain brown, so it must be bb for the B locus (since B is dominant for red) and b for the b locus (so the other gene, which is b, determines brown color). Wait, no\u2014plain is from c, which is recessive. So, if the bird is plain brown, its genotype must be cc for the B locus (since B is dominant for red, and brown is recessive) and bb for the b locus (since brown is dominant for that gene? Wait, no\u2014the other bird is plain brown, meaning it's not showing the dominant phenotype for either gene. So, for the first gene (C), it's C (homozygous), and for the second gene (B), since it's plain, it must be bb (because B is dominant for red, so if it were BB, it would be red). Similarly, for the b gene, being plain brown implies that it's bb (since brown is recessive for that gene).\n\nWait, no\u2014that seems contradictory. Because the bird is plain brown, which would mean for gene B it's bb (brown is recessive), and for gene b it's also bb (since brown is recessive there as well). So the other bird's genotype is ccbb for both genes.\n\nNow, the cross is between CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (homozygous plain brown).\n\nTo find the F1 generation, we'd look at the possible gametes each parent can produce. However, the user already went through the process and created an incorrect F1 list. Instead of CB and cb, which might be wrong, probably they should have considered all possible gametes based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nLet me correct that approach.\n\nFor the CCBB parent:\n- Genotype: C C B B\n- All four alleles are present, so possible gametes are CB and CB, but since the alleles are the same, the gametes will be CB regardless of order. So, only one type of gamete: CB.\n\nFor the ccbb parent:\n- Genotype: c c b b\n- Possible gametes: cb or bc, but since order doesn't matter, they'll all be cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these gametes. So F1 would have two types of birds:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (but since both parents give CB and cb, the offspring would have either CB or cb, depending on which gamete they receive.)\n\nWait, actually, each parent gives one gamete. So the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CCBB: CB\nFrom ccbb: cb\n\nSo F1 genotypes are CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous, the F1 will all be CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the parents are CCBB and ccbb, their gametes are CB and cb, respectively. So when they mate, all offspring will get one allele from each parent: C from CCBB and c from ccbb, and B from CCBB and b from ccbb. So all F1 will be CcBb.\n\nThus, F1 is 100% CcBb.\n\nNow, moving to F2 generation. The F1 will self-pollinate. So, we need to perform a dihybrid cross for F1 (CcBb x CcBb).\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, we calculate probabilities for each combination of alleles. For each gene, the probability of C and c is 0.5 each. Since the genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities.\n\nEach gene independently contributes 25% chance for each combination.\n\nFor example, for the B locus, each F1 bird is Bb. So when crossed, the possible outcomes for B are B and b, each with 25% and 50%, etc., but more accurately, for each gene, the F1 has a 25% chance of each genotype.\n\nWait, better way: Each gene is independently assorting. So for each gene, the F1 bird is Bb (since it's CcBb: C is dominant, so C is present, and B is present as Bb). Therefore, for each gene, the F1 bird is Bb.\n\nWhen F1 (Bb) is crossed with F1 (Bb), the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the b gene, each bird is bb (from Bb). So when crossed, the possible bb (25%), Bb (50%), and BB (25%) for the b gene.\n\nHowever, since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities. So for each gene, 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nPutting it together, for both genes:\n\n- BB (25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%)\n- Bb (25% \u00d7 50% + 50% \u00d7 25% = 25% + 25% = 50%)\n- bb (50% \u00d7 50% = 25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the F1 bird is Bb, so each gene's F1 is Bb, which is a 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSo for each gene:\n\nProbability of BB = 25%\nProbability of Bb = 50%\nProbability of bb = 25%\n\nThen, for both genes:\n\nThe combined probabilities are calculated using multiplication since the genes are independent.\n\nSo:\n\n- Probability of BB (both B and b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Probability of Bb (either B or b for one gene, and the other gene is anything else): Let's think differently. For each gene, the possibilities are BB, Bb, bb. For two genes, each gene's outcome is independent. So the total number of possible combinations is 3x3=9.\n\nOut of these 9, how many correspond to each phenotype?\n\nPhenotype depends on the alleles:\n\n- BB: Checkered red\n- Bb: Checkered brown\n- bb: Plain red (since B is dominant for red)\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether it has at least one dominant allele for B (i.e., B) or not.\n\nWait, no: the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n- Gene C: dominant C \u2192 checkered; recessive c \u2192 plain.\n- Gene B: dominant B \u2192 red; recessive b \u2192 brown.\n\nSo each bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles present for each gene. For example, if a bird is CCBB, it's checkered red. If it's CCbb, it's checkered brown. If it's ccBB, it's plain red. If it's ccbb, it's plain brown.\n\nBut since the F1 birds are all Bb (as per earlier), let's focus on their B alleles.\n\nSo for each F1 bird:\n\n- If they have at least one B allele, they're brown (checkered brown).\n- If they have two b alleles, they're plain red.\n- If they have one B and one b, they're checkered brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014phenotype depends on dominant alleles. So any bird with B (dominant) will show red. Only those without B (i.e., bb) will show brown.\n\nSimilarly, for the c gene (pluripotent unless affected by C?), but C affects the color, so the presence of c does not affect color unless C is recessive. Wait, no\u2014it's about the dominance for each trait.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n- Red color: B dominant, b \u2192 brown.\n\nSo the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to different phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, for each bird, their phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, but each bird is diploid for both genes. So:\n\n- For C: dominant is C, recessive is c.\n- For B: dominant is B, recessive is b.\n\nSo a bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles for each gene.\n\nIf the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will show the corresponding phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene is independent, but the overall phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for B (B_), it will be brown (if B is dominant for red, but the color phenotype is red if B is present, otherwise brown). Wait, no\u2014the problem defines red as having B dominant, brown as recessive.\n\nSo, if a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown; if it has at least one b, it's plain red.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. No\u2014wait, the problem says:\n\nRed color is controlled by dominant allele B; plain color is recessive c. Brown color is controlled by recessive allele b.\n\nSo, if a bird has even one B allele, it's red. If it has at least one b, it's brown.\n\nSo, the phenotype for each bird is determined by the presence of B and b alleles.\n\nSimilarly, for C, it's presence of C determines checkered or plain.\n\nSo, combining both genes, the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nNow, back to the F1 generation. Since all F1 are Bb (assuming the earlier mistake was corrected), we need to determine the phenotypes for each.\n\nFor each bird, they have B and b for the B gene. So, for B:\n\n- If they have at least one B, they're brown (red is when you don't have B, i.e., if you have bb).\n- If they have at least one b, they're plain red (since brown is dominant for that trait? Or wait, no\u2014the problem says brown is recessive. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that brown is controlled by recessive allele b. So, if a bird has at least one b, it's brown. If it has none, it's plain red.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nProblem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n- Red color: B dominant, b \u2192 brown?\nWait, no\u2014the problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n- Red color: B dominant, b \u2192 red.\n- Brown color: b \u2192 brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says:\n\nCheckered pattern is C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n\nRed color is B dominant, b \u2192 brown? Or is it the opposite?\n\nWait, let's re-read:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, red is when B is present (since B is dominant), and brown is when b is present (recessive). Similarly, checkered is when c is present.\n\nWait, no\u2014the first part says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that can't be right because typically, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, if B is dominant for red, then brown would be when b is present.\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that seems off because if B is dominant, then brown would be when b is present, which contradicts typical Mendelian traits where dominant traits are expressed. Alternatively, maybe the problem swapped the roles: perhaps B is for brown, and b is for red. That would make sense because if B is dominant, the phenotype would be brown, and red would be when b is present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let's parse it carefully:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C dominant, c \u2192 plain.\n- Red color: B dominant, b \u2192 red? Or vice versa?\n\nNo, the problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nHmm, that suggests that B is responsible for red, and b is responsible for brown. Which is unusual because typically, the dominant allele masks the recessive effect. But according to the problem, if you have at least one B allele, you get red; if you have at least one b, you get brown.\n\nWait, but that's confusing because typically, brown is recessive for that trait. So perhaps in this context, brown is the dominant allele, and red is the recessive. That would align with standard terminology.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem inverted the roles: perhaps B is for brown, and b is for red.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that:\n\n- If a bird has at least one B allele (B_), it gets red.\n- If it has at least one b allele (b_), it gets brown.\n\nBecause the problem explicitly states that B is dominant for red and b is dominant for brown? Wait, no\u2014no, the problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! So B is responsible for red, and b is responsible for brown. But that would imply that brown is the dominant allele, which conflicts with standard Mendelian traits where dominant traits are expressed.\n\nThis could be a tricky point. Let me assume that the problem intended that B is dominant for red, and b is dominant for brown. So:\n\n- B_ \u2192 red\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nThat would make sense because then, if you have at least one B allele, you're red; if you have at least one b, you're brown.\n\nAlternatively, if it's the other way around, with B being brown and b being red, that's also possible, but given the wording, I think it's more likely that B is red and b is brown.\n\nAnyway, proceeding under this assumption.\n\nSo, for each bird, their phenotype depends on whether they have at least one B or at least one b allele.\n\nNow, the F1 generation is all Bb, so each bird is heterozygous for both genes.\n\nNow, let's compute the phenotypes for F1.\n\nSince each bird is Bb, they have a 50% chance of B and 50% chance of b for each gene.\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- 50% B_, 50% bb\n\nFor the b gene:\n\n- 50% b_, 50% B_\n\nCombined, for each bird:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, for the B gene:\n\n- If they have at least one B (i.e., B_), they are red.\n- If they have at least one b (i.e., bb), they are brown.\n\nFor the b gene:\n\n- If they have at least one b (i.e., b_), they are brown.\n- If they have at least one B (i.e., B_), they are red.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. The presence of at least one dominant allele for a gene determines the phenotype.\n\nSo for the B gene:\n\n- B_: red\n- bb: brown\n\nFor the b gene:\n\n- b_: brown\n- B_: red\n\nBut the presence of either dominant allele for a gene determines the phenotype.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird has alleles for both genes. So, a bird can have B and b for one gene and B and b for the other. Wait, no\u2014they have two alleles for each gene, so for B, they have one allele, and for b, they have another.\n\nWait, no\u2014the bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for the B gene, one allele, and for the b gene, another.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- They have two alleles for B and two for b.\n\nWait, no\u2014in dihybrid crosses, each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for the B gene, a bird has two alleles, say B and b, and similarly for the b gene, B and b.\n\nWait, no\u2014the actual scenario is that each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for the B gene, a bird has two alleles: either BB, Bb, or bb.\n\nSimilarly for the b gene: BB, Bb, or bb.\n\nBut in the F1 generation, all birds are Bb, meaning for each gene, they have one B and one b allele.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. If the F1 bird is Bb, that means they have one B and one b allele. So for each gene, they have one copy of each allele.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, if a bird is Bb, that means for the B gene, they have one B and one b, and similarly for the b gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 bird is Bb, meaning for the B gene, they have one B and one b. Similarly for the b gene, they have one b and one B.\n\nWait, that's impossible because a bird can't have two copies of the same allele.

    "chunk_resampled": "Let me break it down step by step.",
    "rollout": " Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two birds being crossed: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are dominant for both traits\u2014so their genotype is CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown bird, meaning it's homozygous recessive in both genes: cc bb.\n\nThe traits involved are:\n- Gene C determines checkered (dominant) vs. plain (recessive).\n- Gene B determines red (dominant) vs. brown (recessive).\n\nSo each bird can produce gametes that combine these traits. \n\nFor the first parent (CC BB), since both C and B are dominant, all its gametes will be CB. So when it crosses with the second parent (cc bb), all the offspring will get CB from the first parent and either cb or cc from the second parent. Wait, no\u2014the second parent is cc bb. So the second parent can only give cb because it's homozygous recessive. Therefore, all the F1 offspring should have the genotype Cc Bb.\n\nNow, looking at the F1 phenotype. Since C is dominant over c, they'll be checkered. And B is dominant over b, so they'll be red. So all F1 birds are checkered red. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include a pure checkered red as the most frequent phenotype. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Or perhaps the parents aren't as straightforward as I thought. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the first parent is CC BB, which would mean it's a pure dominant individual. The second parent is cc bb, also a pure recessive. So their offspring should all get one C from the first parent and one c from the second, making them Cc. Similarly, one B from the first and one b from the second, making them Bb. But wait, no\u2014that's not right. Each parent contributes one allele per gene. So the first parent gives either C or C (since it's CC), and the second gives either c or c. So the offspring will always be Cc. Similarly, the first parent gives B or B, and the second gives b or b, so the offspring will always be Bb.\n\nTherefore, every F1 bird is Cc Bb, which translates to checkered (C) and red (B). So all F1 are checkered red. Now, moving on to F2.\n\nTo find the F2 ratio, we need to consider the selfing of the F1. F1 is Cc Bb, so when it selfs:\n\nFor gene C:\n- Probability of CC = 25%\n- Probability of Cc = 50%\n- Probability of cc = 25%\n\nFor gene B:\n- Probability of BB = 25%\n- Probability of Bb = 50%\n- Probability of bb = 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities for each combination. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes based on the given traits:\n\n- Checkered (C) and red (B): All these will express as checkered red.\n- Checkered (C) and brown (b): Express checkered brown.\n- Plain (cc) and red (B): Plain red.\n- Plain (cc) and brown (b): Plain brown.\n\nNow, counting how many each:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 + 2 = 6\nCheckered brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 1 + 1 = 2\nPlain red: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 1 + 1 = 2\nPlain brown: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 6 : 2 : 2 : 1\n\nLooking at the options, option A says 6,2,6,2, but that's checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Option B has 8,4,0,4\u2014which doesn't make sense because some phenotypes shouldn't be zero. Option D has 1,3,9,3\u2014nope. Option G has 12,2,2,0\u2014no, because checkered red should be more than 6. Option E has 3,9,1,3\u2014nope. Option J has 2,6,3,1\u2014no, because checkered brown isn't 6. Option H has 5,3,2,6\u2014no. Option F has 4,4,4,4\u2014no. Option C has 9,3,3,1\u2014no. Option I has 7,5,1,3\u2014no.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match exactly what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16.\n\nNumber of checkered red: 4 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\nCheckered brown: 2 (from CC bb, Cc bb)\nPlain red: 2 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\nPlain brown: 1 (from cc bb)\n\nSo the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2014 no, our calculation shows 4:2:2:1.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2014 no, because there are 16 birds total, and 0 plain brown? No, we have 1 plain brown.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 way too high.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2014 again, 12 checkered red, which seems incorrect.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match my result. Maybe I misinterpreted the cross.\n\nWait, the question asks about the expected phenotypic ratio after F2 generation. Perhaps I miscalculated the number of checkered red.\n\nWait, another approach: calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nCheckered red (CC BB):\n\nProbability of CC: 25% (from Cc * Cc)\nProbability of BB: 25% (from Bb * Bb)\nSo combined probability: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25% \u2192 1/16 of the population.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown (CC bb): same logic \u2192 6.25%.\n\nPlain red (cc BB): 6.25%.\n\nPlain brown (cc bb): 6.25%.\n\nAdding up, checkered red and brown add up to 12.5%, and plain red and brown add up to 12.5%. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F1 is Cc Bb, and when selfed, each gene segregates independently.\n\nSo for C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSo for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 16 birds? Wait, no, 16 birds in total.\n\nWait, if I take 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: (4) \u2192 6.25% of 16 is 1.\n\nWait, no, 16 * 0.0625 = 1. So 1 bird would be checkered red, but earlier count showed 4 birds as checkered red. Hmm, confusion arises.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use Punnett squares correctly.\n\nWait, the F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen selfed, each gene segregates into 25% C/C, 50% C/c, 25% c/c for C.\n\nAnd 25% B/B, 50% B/b, 25% b/b for B.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are combinations where each gene is independent.\n\nEach F2 bird has four possible C genotypes and four possible B genotypes. So 4 x 4 = 16 combinations.\n\nPhenotype:\n\nIf C is present (i.e., Cc or CC), then red (B is present \u2192 Bb or BB). If C is absent (cc), then plain (bb). Then, within those, red (B present) is checkered, brown (b present) is plain brown.\n\nSo for each F2 bird:\n\n- C is present: 12.5% chance (since 3/4 of Cc and cc).\n   - Within that, B is present: 12.5% (3/4 of Bb and bb).\n     - So overall, 0.125 * 0.125 = 0.015625 \u2192 1.5625% of 16 is ~2.5 birds.\n   - Alternatively, considering that if C is present, regardless of B, it's red.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two birds being crossed: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are dominant for both traits\u2014so their genotype is CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown bird, meaning it's homozygous recessive in both genes: cc bb.\n\nThe traits involved are:\n- Gene C determines checkered (dominant) vs. plain (recessive).\n- Gene B determines red (dominant) vs. brown (recessive).\n\nSo each bird can produce gametes that combine these traits. \n\nFor the first parent (CC BB), since both C and B are dominant, all its gametes will be CB. So when it crosses with the second parent (cc bb), all the offspring will get CB from the first parent and either cb or cc from the second parent. Wait, no\u2014the second parent is cc bb. So the second parent can only give cb because it's homozygous recessive. Therefore, all the F1 offspring should have the genotype Cc Bb.\n\nNow, looking at the F1 phenotype. Since C is dominant over c, they'll be checkered. And B is dominant over b, so they'll be red. So all F1 birds are checkered red. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include a pure checkered red as the most frequent phenotype. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Or perhaps the parents aren't as straightforward as I thought. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the first parent is CC BB, which would mean it's a pure dominant individual. The second parent is cc bb, also a pure recessive. So their offspring should all get one C from the first parent and one c from the second, making them Cc. Similarly, one B from the first and one b from the second, making them Bb. But wait, no\u2014that's not right. Each parent contributes one allele per gene. So the first parent gives either C or C (since it's CC), and the second gives either c or c. So the offspring will always be Cc. Similarly, the first parent gives B or B, and the second gives b or b, so the offspring will always be Bb.\n\nTherefore, every F1 bird is Cc Bb, which translates to checkered (C) and red (B). So all F1 are checkered red. Now, moving on to F2.\n\nTo find the F2 ratio, we need to consider the selfing of the F1. F1 is Cc Bb, so when it selfs:\n\nFor gene C:\n- Probability of CC = 25%\n- Probability of Cc = 50%\n- Probability of cc = 25%\n\nFor gene B:\n- Probability of BB = 25%\n- Probability of Bb = 50%\n- Probability of bb = 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities for each combination. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes based on the given traits:\n\n- Checkered (C) and red (B): All these will express as checkered red.\n- Checkered (C) and brown (b): Express checkered brown.\n- Plain (cc) and red (B): Plain red.\n- Plain (cc) and brown (b): Plain brown.\n\nNow, counting how many each:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 + 2 = 6\nCheckered brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 1 + 1 = 2\nPlain red: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 1 + 1 = 2\nPlain brown: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 6 : 2 : 2 : 1\n\nLooking at the options, option A says 6,2,6,2, but that's checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Option B has 8,4,0,4\u2014which doesn't make sense because some phenotypes shouldn't be zero. Option D has 1,3,9,3\u2014nope. Option G has 12,2,2,0\u2014no, because checkered red should be more than 6. Option E has 3,9,1,3\u2014nope. Option J has 2,6,3,1\u2014no, because checkered brown isn't 6. Option H has 5,3,2,6\u2014no. Option F has 4,4,4,4\u2014no. Option C has 9,3,3,1\u2014no. Option I has 7,5,1,3\u2014no.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match exactly what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16.\n\nNumber of checkered red: 4 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\nCheckered brown: 2 (from CC bb, Cc bb)\nPlain red: 2 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\nPlain brown: 1 (from cc bb)\n\nSo the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2014 no, our calculation shows 4:2:2:1.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2014 no, because there are 16 birds total, and 0 plain brown? No, we have 1 plain brown.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 way too high.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2014 again, 12 checkered red, which seems incorrect.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match my result. Maybe I misinterpreted the cross.\n\nWait, the question asks about the expected phenotypic ratio after F2 generation. Perhaps I miscalculated the number of checkered red.\n\nWait, another approach: calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nCheckered red (CC BB):\n\nProbability of CC: 25% (from Cc * Cc)\nProbability of BB: 25% (from Bb * Bb)\nSo combined probability: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25% \u2192 1/16 of the population.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown (CC bb): same logic \u2192 6.25%.\n\nPlain red (cc BB): 6.25%.\n\nPlain brown (cc bb): 6.25%.\n\nAdding up, checkered red and brown add up to 12.5%, and plain red and brown add up to 12.5%. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F1 is Cc Bb, and when selfed, each gene segregates independently.\n\nSo for C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSo for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 16 birds? Wait, no, 16 birds in total.\n\nWait, if I take 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: (4) \u2192 6.25% of 16 is 1.\n\nWait, no, 16 * 0.0625 = 1. So 1 bird would be checkered red, but earlier count showed 4 birds as checkered red. Hmm, confusion arises.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use Punnett squares correctly.\n\nWait, the F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen selfed, each gene segregates into 25% C/C, 50% C/c, 25% c/c for C.\n\nAnd 25% B/B, 50% B/b, 25% b/b for B.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are combinations where each gene is independent.\n\nEach F2 bird has four possible C genotypes and four possible B genotypes. So 4 x 4 = 16 combinations.\n\nPhenotype:\n\nIf C is present (i.e., Cc or CC), then red (B is present \u2192 Bb or BB). If C is absent (cc), then plain (bb). Then, within those, red (B present) is checkered, brown (b present) is plain brown.\n\nSo for each F2 bird:\n\n- C is present: 12.5% chance (since 3/4 of Cc and cc).\n   - Within that, B is present: 12.5% (3/4 of Bb and bb).\n     - So overall, 0.125 * 0.125 = 0.015625 \u2192 1.5625% of 16 is ~2.5 birds.\n   - Alternatively, considering that if C is present, regardless of B, it's red. If C is absent, it's plain.\n\nWait, this approach might be complicating things. Maybe using Punnett squares would help.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square for Cc * Cc:\n\nCc x Cc\n\nPossible gametes: C and c each 50%.\n\nSo F1 for C is CC, Cc, or cc? No, wait, each parent gives C or c. So:\n\nParent1: Cc\nParent2: Cc\n\nPossible gametes:\nC from Parent1 and C from Parent2 \u2192 CC\nC from Parent1 and c from Parent2 \u2192 Cc\nc from Parent1 and C from Parent2 \u2192 Cc\nc from Parent1 and c from Parent2 \u2192 cc\n\nSo the F1 for C is CC, Cc, Cc, cc. So 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSimilarly for Bb * Bb:\n\nGametes: B and b each 50%.\nSo F1 for B is BB, Bb, Bb, bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nNow, combining these:\n\nEach F2 bird has a C and a B trait.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes depend on whether C and/or B are present.\n\n- If both C and B are present: checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is absent: checkered brown.\n- If C is absent but B is present: plain red.\n- If neither C nor B is present: plain brown.\n\nCalculating probabilities:\n\nProbability both C and B present: (probability C present) * (probability B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n\nProbability C present, B absent: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n\nProbability C absent, B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n\nProbability neither present: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16=6.25%\n\nWait, but 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 +6.25 = 100%, which adds up.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 \u2192 108.75% (but wait, 9/16 is 56.25% of 16 birds \u2192 9 birds?)\nWait, actually, 9/16 is 56.25%, so 9 birds.\n\nWait, no, 16 birds:\n\n- 9 birds: checkered red\n- 3 birds: checkered brown\n- 3 birds: plain red\n- 1 bird: plain brown\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says 12,2,2,0 \u2014 no. Option A is 6,2,6,2 \u2014 no. Option C is 9,3,3,1 \u2014 yes! Option C says 9,3,3,1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option A had 6,2,6,2, which added up to 16. But according to this, it's 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut in the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which matches my calculation.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " Let me read it carefully again.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means their genotype must be CCBB because they're homozygous and red is controlled by B. The other bird is a plain brown, so its genotype should be ccbb since it's homozygous and brown is controlled by b.\n\nNow, I need to find the Punnett square for their offspring, specifically the F2 generation. Then, determine the phenotypic ratio based on the genotypes.\n\nFirst, let's break down the parents' genotypes:\n- Parent 1: CCBB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: ccbb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nSo when they mate, each parent will produce gametes that are either C or B from the first gene (since CCBB can only give C), and b or b from the second gene (since ccbb can only give b). Therefore, all gametes from Parent 1 will be CB, and all gametes from Parent 2 will be cb.\n\nWhen these gametes combine, each F1 bird will receive one gamete from each parent. So, the possible combinations are:\n- From Parent 1: C and from Parent 2: c \u2192 Cc\n- From Parent 1: C and from Parent 2: b \u2192 Cb\n- From Parent 1: B and from Parent 2: c \u2192 Bc\n- From Parent 1: B and from Parent 2: b \u2192 Bb\n\nWait, but hold on, Parent 1 is CCBB, so actually, the gametes from Parent 1 would just be CB, not Cc or anything else. Similarly, Parent 2's gametes would be cb. So combining them would result in all possible C and c alleles from Parent 1 and b and b from Parent 2. But wait, no, each parent contributes one allele per gene. Since Parent 1 is CCBB, they have four chromosomes (but since they're homozygous, it's just one type for each gene). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe Parent 1 can only contribute C for both genes, and Parent 2 can only contribute b for both genes. So the F1 generation would have all possible combinations where each gene is either dominant or recessive as per the parents.\n\nBut actually, since Parent 1 is CCBB, he can only pass C for the first gene and B for the second. Similarly, Parent 2 is ccbb, passing c for the first and b for the second. So all F1 birds will get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the first gene, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 for the second gene. That makes sense because both parents can only contribute those specific alleles due to being homozygous.\n\nTherefore, all F1 birds will have the genotype CcBb. Now, we're supposed to look at an F2 generation, which requires considering the F1 selfing. So each F1 bird is CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross itself.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square:\n\nParents: CcBb x CcBb\n\nEach parent can produce gametes that are C/B and c/b combinations. The possible gametes are:\n- C/B\n- C/b\n- c/B\n- c/b\n\nWait, no, actually, each gene is independent, so for the first gene (C/c), there are three possibilities: C, c, or C? Wait, no, Parent 1 is CC, so he can only contribute C. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc, contributing c. So the F1 birds are all Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene? No, wait, no\u2014each bird gets one allele from each parent. So Parent 1 gives C/C for the first gene, and Parent 2 gives c/c for the second. So each F1 bird has Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because Parent 1 is CC, so he can only give C, and Parent 2 is cc, giving c. So each F1 bird will have C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the first gene, making Cc. Similarly, for the second gene, Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b, making Bb. So all F1 birds are CcBb.\n\nNow, when these F1 birds mate, each will produce gametes with a 25% chance of each combination: CC, Cc, cC, and cc. Wait, no\u2014the correct way is that for each gene, the gametes are C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2). So for the first gene, the gametes are C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2), same for the second gene. So the possible gametes are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b. However, since Parent 1 only gives C and Parent 2 gives b, the actual gametes should be Cb, because Parent 1 can only contribute C and Parent 2 can only contribute b. Wait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb, meaning they have two copies of each gene. When they selfmate, each gene is independently assorting. So for the first gene (C/c), the F1 bird is Cc, so when they produce gametes, they can give C or c. Similarly, for the second gene (B/b), the F1 bird is Bb, so they can give B or b. Since the genes are independent, the gametes are combinations of these. So each F1 bird produces four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo the F2 generation will consist of F1 individuals (CcBb) each producing these four gametes equally. So the Punnett square for F2 would involve these gametes.\n\nLet me outline the possible F2 genotypes:\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the second gene (B/b):\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall genotypes are combinations of these. So for example, a bird could be CCBB, CC Bb, CC bb, etc., depending on the gametes received.\n\nHowever, the question asks about phenotypes and genotypic frequencies. So let's focus on that.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Checkered = dominant C and dominant B \u2192 phenotype is red.\n- Plain red = recessive c and recessive B \u2192 phenotype is red.\n- Checkered brown = dominant C and recessive B \u2192 phenotype is brown.\n- Plain brown = recessive c and dominant B \u2192 phenotype is brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (when both parents are pure heterozygotes), the F2 generation will have the following phenotypic ratios based on dominance:\n\n- 9/16 checkered red (CCBB)\n- 3/16 checkered brown (CcBb)\n- 3/16 plain red (ccBB)\n- 1/16 plain brown (cccc? Wait, no, if both are recessive, that would be cc for both genes, but in our case, it's c and c for the first gene and b and b for the second. Wait, no\u2014wait, the first gene's recessive is c, so if both genes are recessive, the phenotype would be plain red, right?\n\nWait, but our F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which are all CcBb. So each F1 bird can produce gametes that are C/B, C/b, c/B, or c/b. When these gametes combine, the F2 will have various combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the F2 as coming from the F1 selfing, where each F1 bird (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b, each with equal probability (25%).\n\nSo the Punnett square would be:\n\nGametes from Parent 1: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b\nGametes from Parent 2: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b\n\nEach combination results in a F2 bird with genotype CcBb + another gamete, leading to various combinations.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to recognize that the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (where both parents are heterozygous for both traits) will have the following phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B: 9/16\n- Dominant C and recessive B: 3/16\n- Recessive C and dominant B: 3/16\n- Recessive C and recessive B: 1/16\n\nBut wait, in our case, the parents are both CcBb, so the F2 will follow the same ratios.\n\nBut let's map this to the given options.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\n\nWait, none of these seem to match exactly.

Let me double-check.\n\nNo, according to the standard dihybrid cross, each of the four categories has probabilities 9, 3, 3, 1 out of 16. So the total F2 population would have:\n\n- 9 checkered red (C_B_)\n- 3 checkered brown (C_bb)\n- 3 plain red (ccBB)\n- 1 plain brown (ccbb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it carefully again.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means their genotype must be CCBB because they're homozygous and red is controlled by B. The other bird is a plain brown, so its genotype should be ccbb since it's homozygous and brown is controlled by b.\n\nNow, I need to find the Punnett square for their offspring, specifically the F2 generation. Then, determine the phenotypic ratio based on the genotypes.\n\nFirst, let's break down the parents' genotypes:\n- Parent 1: CCBB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: ccbb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nSo when they mate, each parent will produce gametes that are either C or B from the first gene (since CCBB can only give C), and b or b from the second gene (since ccbb can only give b). Therefore, all gametes from Parent 1 will be CB, and all gametes from Parent 2 will be cb.\n\nWhen these gametes combine, each F1 bird will receive one gamete from each parent. So, the possible combinations are:\n- From Parent 1: C and from Parent 2: c \u2192 Cc\n- From Parent 1: C and from Parent 2: b \u2192 Cb\n- From Parent 1: B and from Parent 2: c \u2192 Bc\n- From Parent 1: B and from Parent 2: b \u2192 Bb\n\nWait, but hold on, Parent 1 is CCBB, so actually, the gametes from Parent 1 would just be CB, not Cc or anything else. Similarly, Parent 2's gametes would be cb. So combining them would result in all possible C and c alleles from Parent 1 and b and b from Parent 2. But wait, no, each parent contributes one allele per gene. Since Parent 1 is CCBB, they have four chromosomes (but since they're homozygous, it's just one type for each gene). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe Parent 1 can only contribute C for both genes, and Parent 2 can only contribute b for both genes. So the F1 generation would have all possible combinations where each gene is either dominant or recessive as per the parents.\n\nBut actually, since Parent 1 is CCBB, he can only pass C for the first gene and B for the second. Similarly, Parent 2 is ccbb, passing c for the first and b for the second. So all F1 birds will get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the first gene, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 for the second gene. That makes sense because both parents can only contribute those specific alleles due to being homozygous.\n\nTherefore, all F1 birds will have the genotype CcBb. Now, we're supposed to look at an F2 generation, which requires considering the F1 selfing. So each F1 bird is CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross itself.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square:\n\nParents: CcBb x CcBb\n\nEach parent can produce gametes that are C/B and c/b combinations. The possible gametes are:\n- C/B\n- C/b\n- c/B\n- c/b\n\nWait, no, actually, each gene is independent, so for the first gene (C/c), there are three possibilities: C, c, or C? Wait, no, Parent 1 is CC, so he can only contribute C. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc, contributing c. So the F1 birds are all Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene? No, wait, no\u2014each bird gets one allele from each parent. So Parent 1 gives C/C for the first gene, and Parent 2 gives c/c for the second. So each F1 bird has Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because Parent 1 is CC, so he can only give C, and Parent 2 is cc, giving c. So each F1 bird will have C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the first gene, making Cc. Similarly, for the second gene, Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b, making Bb. So all F1 birds are CcBb.\n\nNow, when these F1 birds mate, each will produce gametes with a 25% chance of each combination: CC, Cc, cC, and cc. Wait, no\u2014the correct way is that for each gene, the gametes are C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2). So for the first gene, the gametes are C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2), same for the second gene. So the possible gametes are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b. However, since Parent 1 only gives C and Parent 2 gives b, the actual gametes should be Cb, because Parent 1 can only contribute C and Parent 2 can only contribute b. Wait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb, meaning they have two copies of each gene. When they selfmate, each gene is independently assorting. So for the first gene (C/c), the F1 bird is Cc, so when they produce gametes, they can give C or c. Similarly, for the second gene (B/b), the F1 bird is Bb, so they can give B or b. Since the genes are independent, the gametes are combinations of these. So each F1 bird produces four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo the F2 generation will consist of F1 individuals (CcBb) each producing these four gametes equally. So the Punnett square for F2 would involve these gametes.\n\nLet me outline the possible F2 genotypes:\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the second gene (B/b):\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall genotypes are combinations of these. So for example, a bird could be CCBB, CC Bb, CC bb, etc., depending on the gametes received.\n\nHowever, the question asks about phenotypes and genotypic frequencies. So let's focus on that.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Checkered = dominant C and dominant B \u2192 phenotype is red.\n- Plain red = recessive c and recessive B \u2192 phenotype is red.\n- Checkered brown = dominant C and recessive B \u2192 phenotype is brown.\n- Plain brown = recessive c and dominant B \u2192 phenotype is brown.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (when both parents are pure heterozygotes), the F2 generation will have the following phenotypic ratios based on dominance:\n\n- 9/16 checkered red (CCBB)\n- 3/16 checkered brown (CcBb)\n- 3/16 plain red (ccBB)\n- 1/16 plain brown (cccc? Wait, no, if both are recessive, that would be cc for both genes, but in our case, it's c and c for the first gene and b and b for the second. Wait, no\u2014wait, the first gene's recessive is c, so if both genes are recessive, the phenotype would be plain red, right?\n\nWait, but our F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which are all CcBb. So each F1 bird can produce gametes that are C/B, C/b, c/B, or c/b. When these gametes combine, the F2 will have various combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the F2 as coming from the F1 selfing, where each F1 bird (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b, each with equal probability (25%).\n\nSo the Punnett square would be:\n\nGametes from Parent 1: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b\nGametes from Parent 2: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b\n\nEach combination results in a F2 bird with genotype CcBb + another gamete, leading to various combinations.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to recognize that the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (where both parents are heterozygous for both traits) will have the following phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B: 9/16\n- Dominant C and recessive B: 3/16\n- Recessive C and dominant B: 3/16\n- Recessive C and recessive B: 1/16\n\nBut wait, in our case, the parents are both CcBb, so the F2 will follow the same ratios.\n\nBut let's map this to the given options.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nK. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\n\nWait, none of these seem to match exactly. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, the standard dihybrid cross for two genes where both parents are Heterozygous (CcBb) leads to:\n\n- 9/16 dominant-dominant (checkered red)\n- 3/16 dominant-recessive (checkered brown)\n- 3/16 recessive-dominant (plain red)\n- 1/16 recessive-recessive (plain brown)\n\nSo translating to numbers:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nWhich matches option G.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought the F2 would have more than that. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, according to the standard dihybrid cross, each of the four categories has probabilities 9, 3, 3, 1 out of 16. So the total F2 population would have:\n\n- 9 checkered red (C_B_)\n- 3 checkered brown (C_bb)\n- 3 plain red (ccBB)\n- 1 plain brown (ccbb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "rollout": " Let me start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, there are two parents involved in the cross: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). The question asks about an A Punnett square for an adihybrid cross, but wait, that doesn't make sense because adihybrid refers to dihybrids, like two genes each showing two alleles. But here, both parents have two different traits, not two genes with the same locus. Maybe they're considering a different approach or perhaps there's a typo in the term \"adihybrid.\" I'll assume they meant dihybrid cross since that's more common when dealing with two traits.\n\nSo, let's move on. The offspring will be F1, which means their genotype is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So when crossed, the gametes from the first parent would be CB and cb, and from the second parent, it would be cb and cB? Or maybe just Cc, BB, etc.? Hmm, I think I need to clarify how the cross works.\n\nWait, the initial statement says gametes for F1 are (CB)(cb), but then later lists all possible gametes as (CB)(cb). That seems inconsistent. Actually, the correct gametes should be a combination of the alleles. Since the first parent is CCBB, which is heterozygous for both C and B, its gametes would be C/B and C/b. Similarly, the second parent is ccbb, which is homozygous recessive for both c and b, so its gametes would be c/b. Therefore, the F1 generation would have gametes like Cc, Cb, cb, and cb again, leading to four possible combinations: CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb. So the F1 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nBut the question mentions showing the F2 generation after another cross. Wait, no\u2014wait, the user provided some gametes and an F1 list, but then the question starts talking about an A Punnett square for adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then it goes into the F2 generation.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). Then, for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but an adihybrid cross involves two different genes. However, here we have only two birds with different phenotypes based on two traits. It might be a confusion between dihybrid and adihybrid crosses. Dihybrid would involve two different genes, while adihybrid refers to a cross involving two different types of animals, like a cross of a bird and a fish, but here both are birds.\n\nMaybe the intended meaning is a dihybrid cross, where each parent has two different traits. So, the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 CcBB, or maybe CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, depending on the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the initial parents are CCBB (homozygous dominant for C and dominant for B) and ccbb (homozygous recessive for c and b). When crossed, the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, right?\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: CCBB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both C and B.\n   - Parent 2: ccbb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both c and b.\n\n2. Determine the possible gametes each parent can produce.\n   - Parent 1 can produce gametes: C/B and C/b.\n   - Parent 2 can produce gametes: c/b.\n\n3. Create the F1 generation's possible gamete combinations:\n   - Parent 1's gametes: C/B and C/b.\n   - Parent 2's gametes: c and b.\n   - Combining these gives:\n     - C/B + c = CcBb\n     - C/B + b = CcBb\n     - C/b + c = CcBb\n     - C/b + b = Ccbb\n\nWait, actually, each parent contributes one gamete, so the F1 would be:\n- From Parent 1: C/B or C/b\n- From Parent 2: c/b\n\nCombining them:\n- C/B + c = CcBb\n- C/B + b = CcBb\n- C/b + c = CcBb\n- C/b + b = Ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each parent produces one gamete, so the possible F1 genotypes are combinations of one allele from each parent. So, Parent 1 can contribute either C/B or C/b, and Parent 2 can contribute c or b.\n\nThus, F1 genotypes are:\n- C/B + c = CcBb\n- C/B + b = CcBb\n- C/b + c = CcBb\n- C/b + b = Ccbb\n\nWait, but in reality, the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 Ccbb if both parents are CCBB and ccbb. No, that's not correct. Wait, no\u2014the correct F1 would be from CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. So the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nNow, let's set up the Punnett square for the dihybrid cross. Each parent has two alleles for each trait. The F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, but the F1's genotype would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but let me confirm.\n\nActually, when you cross CCBB (which is C/B and C/b) with ccbb (c/b), the F1 genotypes are:\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- Ccbb\n\nSo, in the Punnett square, we'd have:\n\n          | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | Ccbb |\n        ----------------|\n        CcBb | CC BB | CC Bb | CC Bb | CC bb |\n        c    | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  |\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nEach parent's gametes are:\nParent 1: C/B and C/b\nParent 2: c and b\n\nSo, the F1 genotypes are combinations:\n- C/B + c = CcBb\n- C/B + b = CcBb\n- C/b + c = CcBb\n- C/b + b = Ccbb\n\nTherefore, the F1 will have three CcBb and one Ccbb? Wait, no\u2014it depends on how many each gamete contributes. Since each parent contributes one gamete, the total number of F1 individuals is 4, with three being CcBb and one being Ccbb. But wait, that doesn't seem right because each parent produces multiple gametes. Oh, wait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing things up. Each parent produces two gametes, so the F1 would be four possible combinations, resulting in four F1 birds.\n\nWait, actually, each parent contributes one gamete, so the F1 would be four individuals, each with a unique combination. Three of them would be CcBb, and one would be Ccbb.\n\nNow, moving to the dihybrid cross, which is the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross, so each F1 bird reproduces.\n\nThe F1 genotypes are CcBb and Ccbb.\n\nFor the F2 generation, we'll look at the phenotypes based on the dominance hierarchy given.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant alleles lead to dominant phenotypes.\n- Genotypes determine phenotypes as per the dominance hierarchy.\n\nGiven:\n- C and B are dominant over c and b.\n- The hierarchy is C > B > c > b.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem specifies:\nRed is C and B, brown is c and b.\n\nRed is determined by C and B, which are dominant over c and b.\n\nSo, the hierarchy is C (dominant) > B (dominant) > c (recessive) > b (recessive).\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered red (C_B_)\n- Checkered brown (c_b_)\n- Plain red (c_B_)\n- Plain brown (c_bb)\n\nNow, let's find the proportions of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (two independent genes), the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut wait, that's when both traits are expressed independently. Here, the traits are controlled by different loci, but according to the problem, they're controlled by separate genes. Wait, but the problem states that red is C and B, and brown is c and b. So, it's likely that the two traits are controlled by the same gene locus, making it a dihybrid situation. Alternatively, they could be on different loci.\n\nAssuming they're on the same locus, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by combining the dominance hierarchies.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the F1 genotypes are CcBb and Ccbb.\n\nWhen F1 \u00d7 F1 occurs, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n2. CcBb \u00d7 Ccbb\n3. Ccbb \u00d7 CcBb\n4. Ccbb \u00d7 Ccbb\n\nWe'll analyze each case.\n\nCase 1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nThis is a dihybrid cross for two loci, assuming the genes are linked. Without knowing linkage, it's often assumed independent, giving a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the two loci are the same (both C and B vs c and b), so if they are on the same chromosome, the segregation would follow the simple dihybrid rule.\n\nAlternatively, if they are on different chromosomes, the segregation would still follow the dihybrid rule, but the phenotypic ratios may differ due to recombination frequency. However, since the problem doesn't mention any recombinant frequencies, I'll proceed under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nSo, Case 1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 9:3:3:1.\n\nCase 2: CcBb \u00d7 Ccbb\n\nHere, one parent is CcBb and the other is Ccbb.\n\nSince CcBb is C/B and C/b, and Ccbb is C/b and c/b.\n\nCrossing these:\n\nThe F2 will have:\n\n- For C: possible alleles C/C, C/c, c/c\n- For B: possible alleles B/B, B/b, b/b\n- For c: possible alleles c/c (from Ccbb)\n- For b: possible alleles b/b (from Ccbb)\n\nWait, no\u2014since one parent is CcBb and the other is Ccbb.\n\nSo, for the F2:\n\nC: from CcBb (C/B) and Ccbb (Cc). Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. So for the F2:\n\nFrom CcBb \u00d7 Ccbb:\n\nPossible gametes from CcBb: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b\nPossible gametes from Ccbb: C/b, c/b\n\nSo, F2 genotypes:\n\nFor C:\n- C/B + C/b = C/C, C/C, C/c, C/c\n- c/B + C/b = c/C, c/C, c/c, c/c\n- c/b + C/b = c/C, c/C, c/c, c/c\n- c/b + c/b = c/c, c/c\n\nWait, that's complicated. Instead, using the standard dihybrid formula, the probabilities would be:\n\nFor C: 25% C/C, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\nFor c: 25% cc, 50% cC, 25% cc\nFor b: 25% bb, 50% bc, 25% bb\n\nBut since the F1 is CcBb and Ccbb, the actual F2 would depend on whether the parents are CcBb or Ccbb.\n\nWait, CcBb is C/B and C/b, and Ccbb is C/b and c/b.\n\nSo, the F2 will be:\n\nFor C:\n- C/B \u00d7 Ccbb: C/C, C/c, c/C, c/c\n- c/B \u00d7 Ccbb: c/C, c/c, c/C, c/c\n- c/b \u00d7 Ccbb: c/C, c/c, c/c, c/c\n\nSimilarly for B and b.\n\nThis is getting too detailed. Let's instead use the dihybrid formula.\n\nThe combined phenotypic ratio for two traits is 9:3:3:1, regardless of linkage. So, in this case, each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_\n- Checkered brown: c_b_\n- Plain red: c_B_\n- Plain brown: c_bb\n\nNow, calculating the proportion:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_) occurs when both C and B are present. Since C and B are dominant, the probability is 25%.\n\nCheckered brown (c_b_) occurs when neither C nor B is present. Probability is 25%.\n\nPlain red (c_B_) occurs when c is present but B is absent. Probability is 25%.\n\nPlain brown (c_bb) occurs when both c and b are present. Probability is 25%.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, but let me verify:\n\nIf each gene is dominant, the phenotypes would be determined by both genes. If the hierarchy is such that dominant alleles take precedence, then:\n\n- If either C or B is present, it's checkered.\n- Only when neither is present does it become plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both C and B are present, it's checkered. Otherwise, it's plain. So the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant: Checkered red\n2. Neither dominant: Plain red (if both c and b are recessive)\n3. One dominant, one recessive: Checkered brown\n4. Both recessive: Plain brown\n\nWait, but the hierarchy is C > B > c > b. So, if both C and B are present, it's checkered. If only C is present, it's checkered. Only when neither is present is it plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem defines red as C and B, and brown as c and b. So, checkered red is when both C and B are present (C_B_), and checkered brown is when neither C nor B is present (c_b_). Plain red is when only c is present (c_B_), and plain brown is when both c and b are present (c_bb).\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, 25% plain brown.\n\nBut that can't be right because 25% each would sum to 100%. But looking at the options, option D shows 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown, which sums to 16, not 100. Option H has 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. Option G has 12,2,2,0, summing to 16. Option E has 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. Option F has 4,4,4,4, summing to 16.\n\nWait, none of these add to 100. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't a dihybrid cross but a test cross or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only certain alleles, or the inheritance is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio without assuming independent assortment, but that complicates things further.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to a dihybrid cross in terms of two separate traits, but the problem is structured differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation in a cross where both parents are of a particular type, and the analysis needs to consider the F1 and F2 correctly.\n\nWait, going back to the problem, the question is about completing a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nWait, perhaps the adihybrid cross refers to a cross of two birds, one with both dominant traits (checkered red) and the other with both recessive traits (plain brown). So, the cross would be CCBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nBut the problem mentions a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Wait, but in reality, a bird can't be homozygous for both traits unless it's CCBB or ccbb, but that's not typical. So, perhaps the question is referring to crossing two birds, one with both dominant (checkered red) and one with both recessive (plain brown).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, there are two parents involved in the cross: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). The question asks about an A Punnett square for an adihybrid cross, but wait, that doesn't make sense because adihybrid refers to dihybrids, like two genes each showing two alleles. But here, both parents have two different traits, not two genes with the same locus. Maybe they're considering a different approach or perhaps there's a typo in the term \"adihybrid.\" I'll assume they meant dihybrid cross since that's more common when dealing with two traits.\n\nSo, let's move on. The offspring will be F1, which means their genotype is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So when crossed, the gametes from the first parent would be CB and cb, and from the second parent, it would be cb and cB? Or maybe just Cc, BB, etc.? Hmm, I think I need to clarify how the cross works.\n\nWait, the initial statement says gametes for F1 are (CB)(cb), but then later lists all possible gametes as (CB)(cb). That seems inconsistent. Actually, the correct gametes should be a combination of the alleles. Since the first parent is CCBB, which is heterozygous for both C and B, its gametes would be C/B and C/b. Similarly, the second parent is ccbb, which is homozygous recessive for both c and b, so its gametes would be c/b. Therefore, the F1 generation would have gametes like Cc, Cb, cb, and cb again, leading to four possible combinations: CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb. So the F1 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nBut the question mentions showing the F2 generation after another cross. Wait, no\u2014wait, the user provided some gametes and an F1 list, but then the question starts talking about an A Punnett square for adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then it goes into the F2 generation.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). Then, for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but an adihybrid cross involves two different genes. However, here we have only two birds with different phenotypes based on two traits. It might be a confusion between dihybrid and adihybrid crosses. Dihybrid would involve two different genes, while adihybrid refers to a cross involving two different types of animals, like a cross of a bird and a fish, but here both are birds.\n\nMaybe the intended meaning is a dihybrid cross, where each parent has two different traits. So, the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 CcBB, or maybe CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, depending on the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the initial parents are CCBB (homozygous dominant for C and dominant for B) and ccbb (homozygous recessive for c and b). When crossed, the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, right?\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: CCBB \u2192 Homozygous dominant for both C and B.\n   - Parent 2: ccbb \u2192 Homozygous recessive for both c and b.\n\n2. Determine the possible gametes each parent can produce.\n   - Parent 1 can produce gametes: C/B and C/b.\n   - Parent 2 can produce gametes: c/b.\n\n3. Create the F1 generation's possible gamete combinations:\n   - Parent 1's gametes: C/B and C/b.\n   - Parent 2's gametes: c and b.\n   - Combining these gives:\n     - C/B + c = CcBb\n     - C/B + b = CcBb\n     - C/b + c = CcBb\n     - C/b + b = Ccbb\n\nWait, actually, each parent contributes one gamete, so the F1 would be:\n- From Parent 1: C/B or C/b\n- From Parent 2: c/b\n\nCombining them:\n- C/B + c = CcBb\n- C/B + b = CcBb\n- C/b + c = CcBb\n- C/b + b = Ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each parent produces one gamete, so the possible F1 genotypes are combinations of one allele from each parent. So, Parent 1 can contribute either C/B or C/b, and Parent 2 can contribute c or b.\n\nThus, F1 genotypes are:\n- C/B + c = CcBb\n- C/B + b = CcBb\n- C/b + c = CcBb\n- C/b + b = Ccbb\n\nWait, but in reality, the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 Ccbb if both parents are CCBB and ccbb. No, that's not correct. Wait, no\u2014the correct F1 would be from CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. So the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nNow, let's set up the Punnett square for the dihybrid cross. Each parent has two alleles for each trait. The F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, but the F1's genotype would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but let me confirm.\n\nActually, when you cross CCBB (which is C/B and C/b) with ccbb (c/b), the F1 genotypes are:\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- Ccbb\n\nSo, in the Punnett square, we'd have:\n\n          | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | Ccbb |\n        ----------------|\n        CcBb | CC BB | CC Bb | CC Bb | CC bb |\n        c    | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  |\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nEach parent's gametes are:\nParent 1: C/B and C/b\nParent 2: c and b\n\nSo, the F1 genotypes are combinations:\n- C/B + c = CcBb\n- C/B + b = CcBb\n- C/b + c = CcBb\n- C/b + b = Ccbb\n\nTherefore, the F1 will have three CcBb and one Ccbb? Wait, no\u2014it depends on how many each gamete contributes. Since each parent contributes one gamete, the total number of F1 individuals is 4, with three being CcBb and one being Ccbb. But wait, that doesn't seem right because each parent produces multiple gametes. Oh, wait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing things up. Each parent produces two gametes, so the F1 would be four possible combinations, resulting in four F1 birds.\n\nWait, actually, each parent contributes one gamete, so the F1 would be four individuals, each with a unique combination. Three of them would be CcBb, and one would be Ccbb.\n\nNow, moving to the dihybrid cross, which is the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross, so each F1 bird reproduces.\n\nThe F1 genotypes are CcBb and Ccbb.\n\nFor the F2 generation, we'll look at the phenotypes based on the dominance hierarchy given.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant alleles lead to dominant phenotypes.\n- Genotypes determine phenotypes as per the dominance hierarchy.\n\nGiven:\n- C and B are dominant over c and b.\n- The hierarchy is C > B > c > b.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem specifies:\nRed is C and B, brown is c and b.\n\nRed is determined by C and B, which are dominant over c and b.\n\nSo, the hierarchy is C (dominant) > B (dominant) > c (recessive) > b (recessive).\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered red (C_B_)\n- Checkered brown (c_b_)\n- Plain red (c_B_)\n- Plain brown (c_bb)\n\nNow, let's find the proportions of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (two independent genes), the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut wait, that's when both traits are expressed independently. Here, the traits are controlled by different loci, but according to the problem, they're controlled by separate genes. Wait, but the problem states that red is C and B, and brown is c and b. So, it's likely that the two traits are controlled by the same gene locus, making it a dihybrid situation. Alternatively, they could be on different loci.\n\nAssuming they're on the same locus, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by combining the dominance hierarchies.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the F1 genotypes are CcBb and Ccbb.\n\nWhen F1 \u00d7 F1 occurs, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n2. CcBb \u00d7 Ccbb\n3. Ccbb \u00d7 CcBb\n4. Ccbb \u00d7 Ccbb\n\nWe'll analyze each case.\n\nCase 1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nThis is a dihybrid cross for two loci, assuming the genes are linked. Without knowing linkage, it's often assumed independent, giving a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the two loci are the same (both C and B vs c and b), so if they are on the same chromosome, the segregation would follow the simple dihybrid rule.\n\nAlternatively, if they are on different chromosomes, the segregation would still follow the dihybrid rule, but the phenotypic ratios may differ due to recombination frequency. However, since the problem doesn't mention any recombinant frequencies, I'll proceed under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nSo, Case 1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 9:3:3:1.\n\nCase 2: CcBb \u00d7 Ccbb\n\nHere, one parent is CcBb and the other is Ccbb.\n\nSince CcBb is C/B and C/b, and Ccbb is C/b and c/b.\n\nCrossing these:\n\nThe F2 will have:\n\n- For C: possible alleles C/C, C/c, c/c\n- For B: possible alleles B/B, B/b, b/b\n- For c: possible alleles c/c (from Ccbb)\n- For b: possible alleles b/b (from Ccbb)\n\nWait, no\u2014since one parent is CcBb and the other is Ccbb.\n\nSo, for the F2:\n\nC: from CcBb (C/B) and Ccbb (Cc). Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. So for the F2:\n\nFrom CcBb \u00d7 Ccbb:\n\nPossible gametes from CcBb: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b\nPossible gametes from Ccbb: C/b, c/b\n\nSo, F2 genotypes:\n\nFor C:\n- C/B + C/b = C/C, C/C, C/c, C/c\n- c/B + C/b = c/C, c/C, c/c, c/c\n- c/b + C/b = c/C, c/C, c/c, c/c\n- c/b + c/b = c/c, c/c\n\nWait, that's complicated. Instead, using the standard dihybrid formula, the probabilities would be:\n\nFor C: 25% C/C, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\nFor c: 25% cc, 50% cC, 25% cc\nFor b: 25% bb, 50% bc, 25% bb\n\nBut since the F1 is CcBb and Ccbb, the actual F2 would depend on whether the parents are CcBb or Ccbb.\n\nWait, CcBb is C/B and C/b, and Ccbb is C/b and c/b.\n\nSo, the F2 will be:\n\nFor C:\n- C/B \u00d7 Ccbb: C/C, C/c, c/C, c/c\n- c/B \u00d7 Ccbb: c/C, c/c, c/C, c/c\n- c/b \u00d7 Ccbb: c/C, c/c, c/c, c/c\n\nSimilarly for B and b.\n\nThis is getting too detailed. Let's instead use the dihybrid formula.\n\nThe combined phenotypic ratio for two traits is 9:3:3:1, regardless of linkage. So, in this case, each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_\n- Checkered brown: c_b_\n- Plain red: c_B_\n- Plain brown: c_bb\n\nNow, calculating the proportion:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_) occurs when both C and B are present. Since C and B are dominant, the probability is 25%.\n\nCheckered brown (c_b_) occurs when neither C nor B is present. Probability is 25%.\n\nPlain red (c_B_) occurs when c is present but B is absent. Probability is 25%.\n\nPlain brown (c_bb) occurs when both c and b are present. Probability is 25%.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, but let me verify:\n\nIf each gene is dominant, the phenotypes would be determined by both genes. If the hierarchy is such that dominant alleles take precedence, then:\n\n- If either C or B is present, it's checkered.\n- Only when neither is present does it become plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both C and B are present, it's checkered. Otherwise, it's plain. So the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both dominant: Checkered red\n2. Neither dominant: Plain red (if both c and b are recessive)\n3. One dominant, one recessive: Checkered brown\n4. Both recessive: Plain brown\n\nWait, but the hierarchy is C > B > c > b. So, if both C and B are present, it's checkered. If only C is present, it's checkered. Only when neither is present is it plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem defines red as C and B, and brown as c and b. So, checkered red is when both C and B are present (C_B_), and checkered brown is when neither C nor B is present (c_b_). Plain red is when only c is present (c_B_), and plain brown is when both c and b are present (c_bb).\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, 25% plain brown.\n\nBut that can't be right because 25% each would sum to 100%. But looking at the options, option D shows 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown, which sums to 16, not 100. Option H has 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. Option G has 12,2,2,0, summing to 16. Option E has 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. Option F has 4,4,4,4, summing to 16.\n\nWait, none of these add to 100. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't a dihybrid cross but a test cross or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only certain alleles, or the inheritance is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio without assuming independent assortment, but that complicates things further.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to a dihybrid cross in terms of two separate traits, but the problem is structured differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation in a cross where both parents are of a particular type, and the analysis needs to consider the F1 and F2 correctly.\n\nWait, going back to the problem, the question is about completing a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nWait, perhaps the adihybrid cross refers to a cross of two birds, one with both dominant traits (checkered red) and the other with both recessive traits (plain brown). So, the cross would be CCBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nBut the problem mentions a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Wait, but in reality, a bird can't be homozygous for both traits unless it's CCBB or ccbb, but that's not typical. So, perhaps the question is referring to crossing two birds, one with both dominant (checkered red) and one with both recessive (plain brown). So, the cross would be CCBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nThen, the F2 would result from the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nNow, let's compute the F2 phenotypic ratio.\n\nAs before, the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nThe F2 genotypes would be combinations of one allele from each parent.\n\nBut wait, each parent contributes two alleles, so F2 would have four alleles.\n\nBut let's focus on the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird will have two alleles for each trait, so the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: C_B_ (both C and B present)\n2. Checkered brown: c_b_ (neither C nor B present)\n3. Plain red: c_B_ (only c present)\n4. Plain brown: c_bb (both c and b present)\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportions:\n\nUsing a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut in this case, since the two traits are on different loci, the phenotypic ratios might be similar, but the actual counts depend on the number of each genotype.\n\nHowever, the problem presents various answer choices, and none of",

    "rollout": " Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question is about a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C, which means they are heterozygous for that trait. Plain color is due to the recessive allele c. Then there's another pair of genes\u2014red color (dominant gene B) and brown (recessive allele b). So each bird has two alleles for these genes.\n\nThe cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents would be:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 genotype CC BB? Wait, no. Because the dominant gene is C for checkered and c for plain, and B for red and b for brown. But wait, the first parent says \"checkered red\" and \"plain brown.\" Hmm, maybe the first parent is CC BB, but let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the first parent is described as a homozygous checkered red bird. Since C is dominant for checkered, being homozygous checkered would mean both alleles are C. And red is dominant over brown, so if the bird is red, then at least one B allele must be present. But since the bird is homozygous for red, both B alleles must be present. So the genotype is CC BB.\n\nThe second parent is a plain brown bird, meaning it's homozygous for the other traits. Since brown is recessive (because blue isn't mentioned), the plain means both c alleles. And red is dominant, so at least one B allele. So the genotype is cc bb.\n\nNow, we're doing an ABO blood group cross, but in this case, it's about multiple genes. The question is asking for a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two birds. But wait, the user provided some gametes and offspring listed. Maybe I need to use those instead of building my own Punnett square.\n\nLooking at the provided gametes:\n\n- CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nSo the F1 generation would have four types of gametes, leading to four possible offspring types.\n\nThen, the F1s self-mate to produce F2 generation. The user lists all the F2 offspring with their genotypes and phenotypes.\n\nBut the question asks specifically for the F2 phenotypic ratios after considering the checks and recombination rates. However, the user hasn't provided any data on recombinant chromosomes or recombination frequency, so perhaps the assumption is that there's no crossing over, so all chromosomes assort independently.\n\nGiven that, the F2 should have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly because the options include different numbers like 6, 2, etc., up to 12.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nSo option G is 12,2,2,0. That would suggest that all F2 individuals exhibit the same phenotype except two, which might not make sense.\n\nWait, let me look back. The F2 table shows:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n\n- Checkered brown: 3\n\n- Plain red: 3\n\n- Plain brown:1\n\nThat adds up to 16. So 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nIn terms of phenotypes, checkered red and plain red would be two distinct phenotypes, while checkered brown and plain brown would be the other two.\n\nBut in the options, G gives 12,2,2,0, which doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, the initial cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, right?\n\nThen, F1 selfed produces F2. Each F1 individual can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nWhen you cross them, you get combinations of these gametes. So the possible offspring would be:\n\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n\n- Cc (from CB + cB)\n\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n\nSimilarly, other combinations might lead to different phenotypes based on the alleles present.\n\nWait, but the user already built the F2 table with the correct counts: 9,3,3,1. So according to that, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G: 12,2,2,0. That doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1=16. Option G sums to 16 (12+2+2+0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the F2:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n\n- Checkered brown:3\n\n- Plain red:3\n\n- Plain brown:1\n\nTotal:16.\n\nIf the F2 has 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, that's 16 total.\n\nIn terms of phenotypes, the question probably groups checkered red and plain red into one category, and similarly for brown. So the phenotypic ratio would be 12:6:6:2, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, no, the options don't list such ratios. Instead, option G is 12,2,2,0, which suggests that all checkered red and plain red have the same phenotype, and similarly for brown, but that seems incorrect because the presence of either B or b would change the phenotype.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think differently.\n\nEach bird has two loci: one for C (dominant checkered, recessive plain) and one for B (dominant red, recessive brown). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): both alleles are dominant for both traits.\n\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): dominant C, recessive b.\n\n- Plain red (cc_B_): recessive c, dominant B.\n\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): recessive c, recessive b.\n\nIn the F2, the distribution would be 9:3:3:1, as per Mendelian ratios, assuming independent assortment without any interference.\n\nBut the answer choices don't have 9:3:3:1. They have various ratios like 1,3,9,3 and others.\n\nWait, perhaps the user confused the order. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3\n\nWhich would correspond to 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nThis sum to 16, which matches our earlier count.\n\nBut why would the ratio be 1:3:9:3? It suggests that the F2 ratio is similar to a binomial expansion squared, which would indeed give 9:3:3:1, but ordered as 1,3,9,3.\n\nBut how does that happen? If the parents were heterozygous for two separate genes, say, one for C and one for B, and the cross was between two heterozygotes, the F2 would indeed have a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, the user's options don't directly reflect this. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which could represent the phenotypic ratio as follows:\n\n- Checkered red:1\n\n- Checkered brown:3\n\n- Plain red:9\n\n- Plain brown:3\n\nBut why would the number of checkered red be just 1? Normally, in a dihybrid cross, the ratio is symmetric, so 9:3:3:1.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red. So genotype is CC BB.\n\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown.

Actually, each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo F1 would be Cc Bb (from CB x CB), Cc bb (from CB x cb), cc Bb (from cb x CB), and cc bb (from cb x cb).\n\nThus, F1: Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb.\n\nSelfing F1:\n\nEach gamete combines with another to form the F2.\n\nSo possible combinations:\n\n- CB + CB = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cB = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\n- Similarly for the others, leading to all F2 being Cc Bb and cc Bb and cc bb.\n\nWait, no. Let me try to calculate all possibilities more systematically.\n\nEach F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo the F2 will have combinations of these:\n\n- CB + CB = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cB = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\n- cb + cB = cc Bb\n\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\n- cB + CB = Cc Bb\n\n- cB + cb = cc Bb\n\n- cB + cB = cc BB\n\n- cB + cb = cc Bb\n\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\n- cb + cB = cc Bb\n\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nWait, now grouping these:\n\n- Cc Bb appears from multiple combinations: CB + CB, CB + cb, etc., totaling 8 times.\n\n- cc bb appears once.\n\n- cc Bb appears twice (from cb + cB and cB + cb).\n\n- cc BB appears once.\n\n- Other combinations would be Cc BB (if any, but in this case, since F1 only has Cc and cc for the B locus), so Cc BB wouldn't occur.\n\nSo in reality, the F2 would have:\n\n- Cc Bb: 8/16 = 1/2\n\n- cc bb: 1/16\n\n- cc Bb: 2/16 = 1/8\n\n- cc BB: 1/16\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the previous thought. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Punnett square approach is better.\n\nEach F1 bird is Cc Bb, so when crossed with another F1 bird, the possible offspring would be:\n\nFor the C locus: Cc x Cc \u2192 CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 so 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nFor the B locus: Bb x Bb \u2192 BB, Bb, bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSince the two loci assort independently, the combined probabilities would be:\n\n(1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16 for each combination.\n\nSo overall, the F2 would have:\n\n- CC BB (1/16)\n\n- CC Bb (1/16)\n\n- CC bb (1/16)\n\n- Cc BB (2/16)\n\n- Cc Bb (2/16)\n\n- Cc bb (2/16)\n\n- cc BB (1/16)\n\n- cc Bb (1/16)\n\n- cc bb (1/16)\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier approach where the F2 was considered as 9:3:3:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the genes here. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two loci: one for C (dominant checkered, recessive plain) and one for B (dominant red, recessive brown).\n\nThe F1 are Cc Bb.\n\nSo when F1 self, the possible genotypes for each locus are:\n\nFor C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nCombined, the F2 would have:\n\n- For C:\n\n  - CC (25%)\n  \n  - Cc (50%)\n  \n  - cc (25%)\n\n- For B:\n\n  - BB (25%)\n  \n  - Bb (50%)\n  \n  - bb (25%)\n\nAssuming independence, the F2 phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_): all individuals with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 so 100% (since both are dominant). Wait, no, because both alleles for C and B are dominant, so all individuals are checkered red.\n\nWait, no. Checkered red is when both C and B are dominant, i.e., CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc. All these are checkered red.\n\nPlain red is when C is recessive and B is dominant: cc BB, cc Bb, etc.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown is when C is dominant and B is recessive: CC bb, Cc bb, etc.\n\nPlain brown is when both C and B are recessive: cc bb.\n\nSo in the F2:\n\n- All have C_B_: checkered red (9 cases)\n\n- Some have C_bb: checkered brown (3 cases)\n\n- Others have cc_B_: plain red (3 cases)\n\n- And finally, cc_bb: plain brown (1 case)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question is about a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C, which means they are heterozygous for that trait. Plain color is due to the recessive allele c. Then there's another pair of genes\u2014red color (dominant gene B) and brown (recessive allele b). So each bird has two alleles for these genes.\n\nThe cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents would be:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 genotype CC BB? Wait, no. Because the dominant gene is C for checkered and c for plain, and B for red and b for brown. But wait, the first parent says \"checkered red\" and \"plain brown.\" Hmm, maybe the first parent is CC BB, but let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the first parent is described as a homozygous checkered red bird. Since C is dominant for checkered, being homozygous checkered would mean both alleles are C. And red is dominant over brown, so if the bird is red, then at least one B allele must be present. But since the bird is homozygous for red, both B alleles must be present. So the genotype is CC BB.\n\nThe second parent is a plain brown bird, meaning it's homozygous for the other traits. Since brown is recessive (because blue isn't mentioned), the plain means both c alleles. And red is dominant, so at least one B allele. So the genotype is cc bb.\n\nNow, we're doing an ABO blood group cross, but in this case, it's about multiple genes. The question is asking for a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two birds. But wait, the user provided some gametes and offspring listed. Maybe I need to use those instead of building my own Punnett square.\n\nLooking at the provided gametes:\n\n- CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nSo the F1 generation would have four types of gametes, leading to four possible offspring types.\n\nThen, the F1s self-mate to produce F2 generation. The user lists all the F2 offspring with their genotypes and phenotypes.\n\nBut the question asks specifically for the F2 phenotypic ratios after considering the checks and recombination rates. However, the user hasn't provided any data on recombinant chromosomes or recombination frequency, so perhaps the assumption is that there's no crossing over, so all chromosomes assort independently.\n\nGiven that, the F2 should have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly because the options include different numbers like 6, 2, etc., up to 12.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nSo option G is 12,2,2,0. That would suggest that all F2 individuals exhibit the same phenotype except two, which might not make sense.\n\nWait, let me look back. The F2 table shows:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n\n- Checkered brown: 3\n\n- Plain red: 3\n\n- Plain brown:1\n\nThat adds up to 16. So 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nIn terms of phenotypes, checkered red and plain red would be two distinct phenotypes, while checkered brown and plain brown would be the other two.\n\nBut in the options, G gives 12,2,2,0, which doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, the initial cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, right?\n\nThen, F1 selfed produces F2. Each F1 individual can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nWhen you cross them, you get combinations of these gametes. So the possible offspring would be:\n\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n\n- Cc (from CB + cB)\n\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n\nSimilarly, other combinations might lead to different phenotypes based on the alleles present.\n\nWait, but the user already built the F2 table with the correct counts: 9,3,3,1. So according to that, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G: 12,2,2,0. That doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1=16. Option G sums to 16 (12+2+2+0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the F2:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n\n- Checkered brown:3\n\n- Plain red:3\n\n- Plain brown:1\n\nTotal:16.\n\nIf the F2 has 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, that's 16 total.\n\nIn terms of phenotypes, the question probably groups checkered red and plain red into one category, and similarly for brown. So the phenotypic ratio would be 12:6:6:2, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, no, the options don't list such ratios. Instead, option G is 12,2,2,0, which suggests that all checkered red and plain red have the same phenotype, and similarly for brown, but that seems incorrect because the presence of either B or b would change the phenotype.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think differently.\n\nEach bird has two loci: one for C (dominant checkered, recessive plain) and one for B (dominant red, recessive brown). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): both alleles are dominant for both traits.\n\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): dominant C, recessive b.\n\n- Plain red (cc_B_): recessive c, dominant B.\n\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): recessive c, recessive b.\n\nIn the F2, the distribution would be 9:3:3:1, as per Mendelian ratios, assuming independent assortment without any interference.\n\nBut the answer choices don't have 9:3:3:1. They have various ratios like 1,3,9,3 and others.\n\nWait, perhaps the user confused the order. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3\n\nWhich would correspond to 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nThis sum to 16, which matches our earlier count.\n\nBut why would the ratio be 1:3:9:3? It suggests that the F2 ratio is similar to a binomial expansion squared, which would indeed give 9:3:3:1, but ordered as 1,3,9,3.\n\nBut how does that happen? If the parents were heterozygous for two separate genes, say, one for C and one for B, and the cross was between two heterozygotes, the F2 would indeed have a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, the user's options don't directly reflect this. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which could represent the phenotypic ratio as follows:\n\n- Checkered red:1\n\n- Checkered brown:3\n\n- Plain red:9\n\n- Plain brown:3\n\nBut why would the number of checkered red be just 1? Normally, in a dihybrid cross, the ratio is symmetric, so 9:3:3:1.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red. So genotype is CC BB.\n\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown. So genotype is cc bb.\n\nCrossing them would result in F1: CcBb.\n\nF1 selfing would produce:\n\n- From CC BB: F1: Cc Bb\n\n- From CC bb: Cc Bb\n\n- From cc BB: Cc Bb\n\n- From cc bb: Cc Bb\n\nWait, that's not quite accurate. Actually, each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo F1 would be Cc Bb (from CB x CB), Cc bb (from CB x cb), cc Bb (from cb x CB), and cc bb (from cb x cb).\n\nThus, F1: Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb.\n\nSelfing F1:\n\nEach gamete combines with another to form the F2.\n\nSo possible combinations:\n\n- CB + CB = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cB = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\n- Similarly for the others, leading to all F2 being Cc Bb and cc Bb and cc bb.\n\nWait, no. Let me try to calculate all possibilities more systematically.\n\nEach F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo the F2 will have combinations of these:\n\n- CB + CB = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cB = Cc Bb\n\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\n- cb + cB = cc Bb\n\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\n- cB + CB = Cc Bb\n\n- cB + cb = cc Bb\n\n- cB + cB = cc BB\n\n- cB + cb = cc Bb\n\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\n- cb + cB = cc Bb\n\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nWait, now grouping these:\n\n- Cc Bb appears from multiple combinations: CB + CB, CB + cb, etc., totaling 8 times.\n\n- cc bb appears once.\n\n- cc Bb appears twice (from cb + cB and cB + cb).\n\n- cc BB appears once.\n\n- Other combinations would be Cc BB (if any, but in this case, since F1 only has Cc and cc for the B locus), so Cc BB wouldn't occur.\n\nSo in reality, the F2 would have:\n\n- Cc Bb: 8/16 = 1/2\n\n- cc bb: 1/16\n\n- cc Bb: 2/16 = 1/8\n\n- cc BB: 1/16\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the previous thought. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Punnett square approach is better.\n\nEach F1 bird is Cc Bb, so when crossed with another F1 bird, the possible offspring would be:\n\nFor the C locus: Cc x Cc \u2192 CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 so 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nFor the B locus: Bb x Bb \u2192 BB, Bb, bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSince the two loci assort independently, the combined probabilities would be:\n\n(1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16 for each combination.\n\nSo overall, the F2 would have:\n\n- CC BB (1/16)\n\n- CC Bb (1/16)\n\n- CC bb (1/16)\n\n- Cc BB (2/16)\n\n- Cc Bb (2/16)\n\n- Cc bb (2/16)\n\n- cc BB (1/16)\n\n- cc Bb (1/16)\n\n- cc bb (1/16)\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier approach where the F2 was considered as 9:3:3:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the genes here.

Checkered red is when both C and B are dominant, i.e., CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc. All these are checkered red.\n\nPlain red is when C is recessive and B is dominant: cc BB, cc Bb, etc.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown is when C is dominant and B is recessive: CC bb, Cc bb, etc.\n\nPlain brown is when both C and B are recessive: cc bb.\n\nSo in the F2:\n\n- All have C_B_: checkered red (9 cases)\n\n- Some have C_bb: checkered brown (3 cases)\n\n- Others have cc_B_: plain red (3 cases)\n\n- And finally, cc_bb: plain brown (1 case)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit.

Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So, if both alleles are c, the bird is plain. \n\nThen there's red color controlled by a dominant gene B, meaning at least one B allele makes them red. Brown is determined by the recessive allele b, so both alleles must be b for them to be brown.\n\nSo we're doing an adihybrid cross between two birds: one that's homozygously checkered red, which would be CC BB since they're red (so B is dominant). The other bird is plain brown, which would be cc bb because they're brown (so b is recessive).\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the notation might be a bit confusing. Adihybrid crosses usually involve two traits being considered separately. So each parent contributes one trait. But here, it's about the combination of two genes\u2014C/c and B/b.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red. So genotype is CC BB. Since it's checkered, both parents must have at least one C and at least one B? Or maybe each gene is independently controlled. Wait, no. In dihybrid crosses, the cross is usually between two organisms where each has two independent genes. Here, the first parent is homozygous for both genes (CC BB), and the second is homozygous for one gene (cc) and another (bb). So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where each parent is CC BB and cc bb respectively?\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because you can't have a dihybrid cross from CC BB and cc bb. Maybe the question is about a dihybrid cross where each parent is a heterozygote for both genes. But in this case, the first parent is homozygous for both (CC BB), which seems like it's not possible unless it's a mistake or misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are represented differently. Perhaps the first parent is CC BB (homozygous for both dominant traits), and the second is cc bb (homozygous for both recessive traits). That would make sense as a dihybrid cross, even though each parent is actually a pure line for both traits. But typically, dihybrid crosses involve heterozygotes. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAnyway, moving forward, let's outline the parents:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 genotype CC BB.\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 genotype cc bb.\n\nWe need to find the F2 generation phenotypes based on their offspring. The options given include various phenotypic ratios, so I'll need to calculate the expected genotypes and then determine the phenotypes.\n\nFirst, let's think about the parents' genotypes. Parent 1 is CC BB, which means they have two dominant alleles for both genes (C and B), making them fully dominant and fully expressing their traits. Parent 2 is cc bb, which means they have two recessive alleles (c and b), resulting in plain red (since c is recessive for C and b is recessive for B).\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, what will the F1 generation look like? Each parent will produce gametes according to Mendel's laws. However, since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all their gametes should carry the same alleles. So Parent 1 (CC BB) will produce gametes CB, and Parent 2 (cc bb) will produce gametes cb. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nBut wait, in a typical dihybrid cross, the F1 would be CcBb, and then selfing (to get F2) would result in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, in this case, the parents are different because Parent 1 isn't Cc but CC, and Parent 2 isn't BB but bb. So the cross would be between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nLet me try to set up the Punnett square for this cross. Each parent's gametes:\n\n- From Parent 1 (CC BB): Only CB gamete.\n- From Parent 2 (cc bb): Only cb gamete.\n\nSo the F1 generation would consist of all possible combinations:\n\n- CB (from Parent 1) + cb (from Parent 2) = CcBb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 is CcBb, which means all offspring are CcBb.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if both parents are homozygous, the F1 should all be the same. But the question asks about the F2 generation, so perhaps after F1, which is all CcBb, we need to cross them to get F2.\n\nSo, for the F2 generation, each parent (CcBb x CcBb) would produce gametes. Let me consider each gene separately.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Parent: Cc\n- Gametes: 50% C, 50% c.\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Parent: Bb\n- Gametes: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combination of gametes will follow a Punnett square.\n\nSo, combining C and B gametes:\n\n- C (from Parent 1) + B (from Parent 2) \u2192 CcBb\n- C (from Parent 1) + b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Ccbb\n- c (from Parent 1) + B (from Parent 2) \u2192 cCBb\n- c (from Parent 1) + b (from Parent 2) \u2192 c c b b \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that both parents were homozygous, so the F1 would all be CcBb. Then F2 would come from crossing CcBb x CcBb.\n\nSo the F2 would have the following genotypes based on the Punnett square:\n\n- CcBb (from Cc x Bb)\n- Ccbb\n- cCBb\n- ccbb\n\nEach of these would then translate into their respective phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles.\n\nSo let's map the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Ccbb \u2192 C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cCBb \u2192 c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 Plain Red\n- ccbb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's count the number of each genotype in the F2 generation. Since each parent produces four types of gametes (in terms of each gene), the total F2 population will be 16 (each parent contributes 4 gametes, so 4x4=16 combinations). But considering the actual counts per genotype, we can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nUsing the standard dihybrid cross:\n\n|       | Cc  | c  |\n|-------|-----|----|\n| Bb    | CcBb | ccBb |\n| bb    | Ccbb | ccbb |\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to represent it correctly.\n\nActually, the correct way is:\n\n|        |   Cc  |   c   |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Bb     | CcBb | ccBb |\n| bb     | Ccbb | ccbb |\n\nSo the four genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- ccBb (Plain Red)\n- Ccbb (Checkered Brown)\n- ccbb (Plain Brown)\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect? Well, for two independent genes, each with two alleles, the expected ratio is 1:2:1 for each trait when squaring the sum of the probabilities.\n\nWait, more accurately, for each gene, the probability of each allele is 50% for dominant and recessive. Since the genes are independent, the Punnett square for two genes would be:\n\n- For C (C and c):\n  - 50% C, 50% c\n- For B (B and b):\n  - 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the combined possibilities lead to:\n\n- CcBb: 25%\n- Ccbb: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n- ccbb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are heterozygous for both traits, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in our case, the parents are not both heterozygous. Wait, no\u2014the parents in the F2 cross are both CcBb, so yes, it's similar to a dihybrid cross.\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: CcBb \u2192 25%\n- Checkered Brown: Ccbb \u2192 25%\n- Plain Red: ccBb \u2192 25%\n- Plain Brown: ccbb \u2192 25%\n\nAdding these together, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but looking back, the answer choices don't reflect this exactly. They seem to suggest different ratios.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial setup. The question mentions that the checkered pattern is C, plain is c, red is B, brown is b. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: C and B \u2192 phenotype: Checkered Red\n- Checkered Brown: C and b \u2192 phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Plain Red: c and B \u2192 phenotype: Plain Red\n- Plain Brown: c and b \u2192 phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are equally likely, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer choices directly state this.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC.9:3:3:1\nD.1:3:9:3\nE.3:9:1:3\nF.4:4:4:4\nG.12:2:2:0\nH.5:3:2:6\nI.7:5:1:3\nJ.2:6:3:1\n\nHmm, option F is 4:4:4:4, which corresponds to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So if the question expects the phenotypic ratio to be equal distribution among the four phenotypes, the correct answer would be F. 4:4:4:4.\n\nHowever, let me review the problem statement once more to ensure I haven't missed anything. The parents are homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and plain brown (cc bb). When crossed, all F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be 16 offspring. The expected phenotypes would indeed be equal across all four categories, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which translates to 4 parts each if divided equally.\n\nBut looking back, option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, which fits perfectly. Therefore, the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe question involves a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C, which means they have at least one C allele. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So, if both alleles are c, the bird is plain. \n\nThen there's red color controlled by a dominant gene B, meaning at least one B allele makes them red. Brown is determined by the recessive allele b, so both alleles must be b for them to be brown.\n\nSo we're doing an adihybrid cross between two birds: one that's homozygously checkered red, which would be CC BB since they're red (so B is dominant). The other bird is plain brown, which would be cc bb because they're brown (so b is recessive).\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the notation might be a bit confusing. Adihybrid crosses usually involve two traits being considered separately. So each parent contributes one trait. But here, it's about the combination of two genes\u2014C/c and B/b.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red. So genotype is CC BB. Since it's checkered, both parents must have at least one C and at least one B? Or maybe each gene is independently controlled. Wait, no. In dihybrid crosses, the cross is usually between two organisms where each has two independent genes. Here, the first parent is homozygous for both genes (CC BB), and the second is homozygous for one gene (cc) and another (bb). So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where each parent is CC BB and cc bb respectively?\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because you can't have a dihybrid cross from CC BB and cc bb. Maybe the question is about a dihybrid cross where each parent is a heterozygote for both genes. But in this case, the first parent is homozygous for both (CC BB), which seems like it's not possible unless it's a mistake or misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are represented differently. Perhaps the first parent is CC BB (homozygous for both dominant traits), and the second is cc bb (homozygous for both recessive traits). That would make sense as a dihybrid cross, even though each parent is actually a pure line for both traits. But typically, dihybrid crosses involve heterozygotes. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAnyway, moving forward, let's outline the parents:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 genotype CC BB.\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 genotype cc bb.\n\nWe need to find the F2 generation phenotypes based on their offspring. The options given include various phenotypic ratios, so I'll need to calculate the expected genotypes and then determine the phenotypes.\n\nFirst, let's think about the parents' genotypes. Parent 1 is CC BB, which means they have two dominant alleles for both genes (C and B), making them fully dominant and fully expressing their traits. Parent 2 is cc bb, which means they have two recessive alleles (c and b), resulting in plain red (since c is recessive for C and b is recessive for B).\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, what will the F1 generation look like? Each parent will produce gametes according to Mendel's laws. However, since both parents are homozygous for both traits, all their gametes should carry the same alleles. So Parent 1 (CC BB) will produce gametes CB, and Parent 2 (cc bb) will produce gametes cb. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nBut wait, in a typical dihybrid cross, the F1 would be CcBb, and then selfing (to get F2) would result in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, in this case, the parents are different because Parent 1 isn't Cc but CC, and Parent 2 isn't BB but bb. So the cross would be between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nLet me try to set up the Punnett square for this cross. Each parent's gametes:\n\n- From Parent 1 (CC BB): Only CB gamete.\n- From Parent 2 (cc bb): Only cb gamete.\n\nSo the F1 generation would consist of all possible combinations:\n\n- CB (from Parent 1) + cb (from Parent 2) = CcBb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 is CcBb, which means all offspring are CcBb.\n\nWait, but that seems off because if both parents are homozygous, the F1 should all be the same. But the question asks about the F2 generation, so perhaps after F1, which is all CcBb, we need to cross them to get F2.\n\nSo, for the F2 generation, each parent (CcBb x CcBb) would produce gametes. Let me consider each gene separately.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Parent: Cc\n- Gametes: 50% C, 50% c.\n\nFor Gene B:\n- Parent: Bb\n- Gametes: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combination of gametes will follow a Punnett square.\n\nSo, combining C and B gametes:\n\n- C (from Parent 1) + B (from Parent 2) \u2192 CcBb\n- C (from Parent 1) + b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Ccbb\n- c (from Parent 1) + B (from Parent 2) \u2192 cCBb\n- c (from Parent 1) + b (from Parent 2) \u2192 c c b b \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that both parents were homozygous, so the F1 would all be CcBb. Then F2 would come from crossing CcBb x CcBb.\n\nSo the F2 would have the following genotypes based on the Punnett square:\n\n- CcBb (from Cc x Bb)\n- Ccbb\n- cCBb\n- ccbb\n\nEach of these would then translate into their respective phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles.\n\nSo let's map the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Ccbb \u2192 C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cCBb \u2192 c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 Plain Red\n- ccbb \u2192 c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's count the number of each genotype in the F2 generation. Since each parent produces four types of gametes (in terms of each gene), the total F2 population will be 16 (each parent contributes 4 gametes, so 4x4=16 combinations). But considering the actual counts per genotype, we can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nUsing the standard dihybrid cross:\n\n|       | Cc  | c  |\n|-------|-----|----|\n| Bb    | CcBb | ccBb |\n| bb    | Ccbb | ccbb |\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to represent it correctly.\n\nActually, the correct way is:\n\n|        |   Cc  |   c   |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Bb     | CcBb | ccBb |\n| bb     | Ccbb | ccbb |\n\nSo the four genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- ccBb (Plain Red)\n- Ccbb (Checkered Brown)\n- ccbb (Plain Brown)\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect? Well, for two independent genes, each with two alleles, the expected ratio is 1:2:1 for each trait when squaring the sum of the probabilities.\n\nWait, more accurately, for each gene, the probability of each allele is 50% for dominant and recessive. Since the genes are independent, the Punnett square for two genes would be:\n\n- For C (C and c):\n  - 50% C, 50% c\n- For B (B and b):\n  - 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the combined possibilities lead to:\n\n- CcBb: 25%\n- Ccbb: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n- ccbb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are heterozygous for both traits, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in our case, the parents are not both heterozygous. Wait, no\u2014the parents in the F2 cross are both CcBb, so yes, it's similar to a dihybrid cross.\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: CcBb \u2192 25%\n- Checkered Brown: Ccbb \u2192 25%\n- Plain Red: ccBb \u2192 25%\n- Plain Brown: ccbb \u2192 25%\n\nAdding these together, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but looking back, the answer choices don't reflect this exactly. They seem to suggest different ratios.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial setup. The question mentions that the checkered pattern is C, plain is c, red is B, brown is b. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: C and B \u2192 phenotype: Checkered Red\n- Checkered Brown: C and b \u2192 phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Plain Red: c and B \u2192 phenotype: Plain Red\n- Plain Brown: c and b \u2192 phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are equally likely, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer choices directly state this.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC.9:3:3:1\nD.1:3:9:3\nE.3:9:1:3\nF.4:4:4:4\nG.12:2:2:0\nH.5:3:2:6\nI.7:5:1:3\nJ.2:6:3:1\n\nHmm, option F is 4:4:4:4, which corresponds to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So if the question expects the phenotypic ratio to be equal distribution among the four phenotypes, the correct answer would be F. 4:4:4:4.\n\nHowever, let me review the problem statement once more to ensure I haven't missed anything. The parents are homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and plain brown (cc bb). When crossed, all F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be 16 offspring. The expected phenotypes would indeed be equal across all four categories, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which translates to 4 parts each if divided equally.\n\nBut looking back, option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, which fits perfectly.

    "rollout": " Let me start by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question involves two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means both its alleles are dominant for color and also for the pecking behavior. The other bird is a plain brown, meaning one allele is dominant for color (red) and the other is recessive (brown). So their parents' genotypes must be CC BB and cc bb respectively because they're homozygous.\n\nThe traits in question are:\n- Pecking behavior (C for dominant, c for recessive)\n- Color (B for dominant, b for recessive)\n\nSo, each bird will have two alleles for each trait. Let's list out the possible gametes each parent can make.\n\nFor the first parent (CC BB):\nSince both alleles are dominant, they'll produce gametes that are either CB or BB. But wait, since they're homozygous, all their gametes should carry both dominant alleles. Wait no, actually, for the C and B traits, being homozygous means CC and BB, but when making gametes, each gamete gets one allele. Since they're homozygous, both alleles are the same. So this parent will produce gametes CB (for both C and B), but wait, no\u2014that's not right. If you have CC, then each gamete has C. Similarly, if you have BB, each gamete has B. So the first parent (CC BB) would produce gametes that are either C or B? No, wait\u2014no, the parent is homozygous for both genes, so each gamete carries one allele from each gene. So for the C gene, both alleles are C, so the gamete for C is C. Similarly, for the B gene, both alleles are B, so the gamete for B is B. Therefore, the parent can only produce gametes CB, where each gamete gets one allele from each gene. So, gametes: CB.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. If a bird is homozygous for two traits, like CC BB, then for each trait, both alleles are the same. So for the pecking behavior (C), both alleles are C, so any gamete will get C. For the color (B), both alleles are B, so any gamete will get B. Therefore, each gamete is CB.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is cc bb. They can only produce gametes cb because each gamete takes one allele from each gene. Since both are recessive, each gamete will carry one c and one b.\n\nNow, when these two birds mate, the offspring will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. So let's look at each gene separately.\n\nFor the pecking behavior (C):\nParent 1 contributes C.\nParent 2 contributes c.\nSo the possible gametes from Parent 2 contribute c. Therefore, the offspring will always get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, resulting in genotype Cc. Since C is dominant over c, all offspring will exhibit the dominant phenotype for pecking, which is checkered.\n\nFor the color (B):\nParent 1 contributes B.\nParent 2 contributes b.\nSo the possible gametes from Parent 2 contribute b. Therefore, the offspring will always get B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, resulting in genotype Bb. Since B is dominant, all offspring will express the dominant phenotype for color, which is red.\n\nWait, but the initial setup said that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is recessive c. Also, red is B, and brown is b. So the phenotype depends on the combination of these traits. However, in this case, all offspring will have C (checkered) and B (red), regardless of the other alleles. Because C is dominant, all will show checkered. And B is dominant, so all will show red. Therefore, all offspring will be checkered red birds.\n\nBut the problem statement says to consider an adihybridcross, implying more than just a simple dihybrid cross. Maybe I misunderstood something earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, adihybrid suggests two different genes involved, but here we have two birds with different combinations of C/B and c/b. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross between two birds with different genotypes, leading to a dihybrid cross, but the term 'adihybrid' might indicate using different alleles or combining crosses. But in this case, the parents are already homozygous, so it's a straightforward dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the cross is between a parent who is homozygous for C and B (i.e., CC BB) and another who is homozygous for c and b (cc bb). But that seems unlikely because typically adihybrid crosses involve two different genes. Unless the question is misworded and refers to a dihybrid cross, not an adihybrid. Given the options, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross.\n\nLet me proceed under the assumption that it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. Now, let's construct the Punnett square.\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n\nFrom CC BB: C (from C and C) and B (from B and B), so gametes CB.\nFrom cc bb: c (from c and c) and b (from b and b), so gametes cb.\n\nWhen these combine, the F1 generation will have four combinations:\n- C (from CC) + c (from cc) = Cc\n- C (from CC) + b (from cc) = Cb\n- B (from BB) + c (from cc) = Bc\n- B (from BB) + b (from cc) = Bb\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are Cc, Cb, Bc, Bb. Each of these will translate into specific phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pecking (C): dominant C \u2192 checkered\n- Color (B): dominant B \u2192 red\n- If a bird is both checkered (C) and red (B), it's simply checkered red.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals will be checkered red.\n\nNow, the next part is about the F2 generation. Typically, F2 results from selfing F1 individuals. Since F1 is Cc, Cb, Bc, Bb, when they self, each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor each gene, the possible alleles after selfing are:\n- For C: C (homozygote) or Cc (heterozygote)\n- For B: B (homozygote) or Bb (heterozygote)\n- For c: cc (homozygote)\n- For b: bb (homozygote)\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 for each gene is as follows:\n- Gene C: Cc, Cc, Bc, Bb \u2192 actually, no. Wait, each parent gives one allele for each gene. So F1 for gene C comes from CC BB (C) and cc bb (c), so F1 Cc. Similarly, for gene B, F1 is Bb.\n\nWait, I think I got confused earlier. Let's clarify:\n\nEach parent is CC BB and cc bb. So for gene C:\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\nF1: Cc\n\nFor gene B:\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\nF1: Bb\n\nSo each F1 individual has genotype Cc for C and Bb for B.\n\nWhen F1 self-pollinate, the F2 will result from the combinations of these gametes.\n\nFor gene C:\n- From F1 Cc, gametes are C (25%) and c (75%)\n\nFor gene B:\n- From F1 Bb, gametes are B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nSince genes are independent, the F2 genotypes are combinations of Cc and Bb.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list all combinations:\n\nEach gene can have:\n- For C: C (dominant) or c (recessive)\n- For B: B (dominant) or b (recessive)\n\nThus, F2 genotypes for each gene:\n- C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotype combinations are all possible combinations of these.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nPecking (C):\n- Dominant C \u2192 Checkered (C)\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain (c)\n\nColor (B):\n- Dominant B \u2192 Red (B)\n- Recessive b \u2192 Brown (b)\n\nSo the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether they have C and/or B.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is a combination of their C and B alleles.\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\nThere are 9 possible F2 genotypes, each with a certain probability.\n\nBut since the question asks for phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the number based on probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the F2 distribution for each gene is 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Same for B.\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic distribution can be calculated by considering all possible combinations.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nPhenotype | C status | B status | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered Red (C and B) | Yes | Yes | ?\nPlain Red (c and B) | No | Yes | ?\nCheckered Brown (C and b) | Yes | No | ?\nPlain Brown (c and b) | No | No | ?\n\nTo find the probabilities, we need to sum the probabilities where C is present and/or B is present.\n\nTotal possibilities:\n\n- C present: All cases except cc (but C could be absent or present)\n- B present: All cases except bb\n\nBut let's compute it correctly.\n\nEach bird has a 25% chance of CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc for C.\n\nSimilarly, for B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThe presence of C and B determines the phenotype.\n\nSo, the bird will be:\n\n- Checkered Red (C and B) if they have at least one C and at least one B.\n- Plain Red (c and B) if they have at least one C but no B.\n- Checkered Brown (C and b) if they have at least one C but no B.\n- Plain Brown (c and b) if they have neither C nor B.\n\nBut wait, in reality, since C is dominant and B is dominant, having even one C and one B leads to checkered red. Having one C and no B leads to plain red. Having one C and one b leads to checkered brown. And having none leads to plain brown.\n\nSo, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C and B):\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = (50% + 25%) * (50% + 25%) \n   Wait, no. Actually, the correct way is to multiply the probabilities of each allele being present.\n\nActually, the probability that C is present (C) is 75% (since 25% is cc, which doesn't have C).\nSimilarly, the probability that B is present (B) is 75%.\n\nBut since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability that both are present is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625, i.e., 56.25%.\n\n2.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question involves two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means both its alleles are dominant for color and also for the pecking behavior. The other bird is a plain brown, meaning one allele is dominant for color (red) and the other is recessive (brown). So their parents' genotypes must be CC BB and cc bb respectively because they're homozygous.\n\nThe traits in question are:\n- Pecking behavior (C for dominant, c for recessive)\n- Color (B for dominant, b for recessive)\n\nSo, each bird will have two alleles for each trait. Let's list out the possible gametes each parent can make.\n\nFor the first parent (CC BB):\nSince both alleles are dominant, they'll produce gametes that are either CB or BB. But wait, since they're homozygous, all their gametes should carry both dominant alleles. Wait no, actually, for the C and B traits, being homozygous means CC and BB, but when making gametes, each gamete gets one allele. Since they're homozygous, both alleles are the same. So this parent will produce gametes CB (for both C and B), but wait, no\u2014that's not right. If you have CC, then each gamete has C. Similarly, if you have BB, each gamete has B. So the first parent (CC BB) would produce gametes that are either C or B? No, wait\u2014no, the parent is homozygous for both genes, so each gamete carries one allele from each gene. So for the C gene, both alleles are C, so the gamete for C is C. Similarly, for the B gene, both alleles are B, so the gamete for B is B. Therefore, the parent can only produce gametes CB, where each gamete gets one allele from each gene. So, gametes: CB.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. If a bird is homozygous for two traits, like CC BB, then for each trait, both alleles are the same. So for the pecking behavior (C), both alleles are C, so any gamete will get C. For the color (B), both alleles are B, so any gamete will get B. Therefore, each gamete is CB.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is cc bb. They can only produce gametes cb because each gamete takes one allele from each gene. Since both are recessive, each gamete will carry one c and one b.\n\nNow, when these two birds mate, the offspring will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. So let's look at each gene separately.\n\nFor the pecking behavior (C):\nParent 1 contributes C.\nParent 2 contributes c.\nSo the possible gametes from Parent 2 contribute c. Therefore, the offspring will always get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, resulting in genotype Cc. Since C is dominant over c, all offspring will exhibit the dominant phenotype for pecking, which is checkered.\n\nFor the color (B):\nParent 1 contributes B.\nParent 2 contributes b.\nSo the possible gametes from Parent 2 contribute b. Therefore, the offspring will always get B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, resulting in genotype Bb. Since B is dominant, all offspring will express the dominant phenotype for color, which is red.\n\nWait, but the initial setup said that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is recessive c. Also, red is B, and brown is b. So the phenotype depends on the combination of these traits. However, in this case, all offspring will have C (checkered) and B (red), regardless of the other alleles. Because C is dominant, all will show checkered. And B is dominant, so all will show red. Therefore, all offspring will be checkered red birds.\n\nBut the problem statement says to consider an adihybridcross, implying more than just a simple dihybrid cross. Maybe I misunderstood something earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, adihybrid suggests two different genes involved, but here we have two birds with different combinations of C/B and c/b. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross between two birds with different genotypes, leading to a dihybrid cross, but the term 'adihybrid' might indicate using different alleles or combining crosses. But in this case, the parents are already homozygous, so it's a straightforward dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the cross is between a parent who is homozygous for C and B (i.e., CC BB) and another who is homozygous for c and b (cc bb). But that seems unlikely because typically adihybrid crosses involve two different genes. Unless the question is misworded and refers to a dihybrid cross, not an adihybrid. Given the options, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross.\n\nLet me proceed under the assumption that it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. Now, let's construct the Punnett square.\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n\nFrom CC BB: C (from C and C) and B (from B and B), so gametes CB.\nFrom cc bb: c (from c and c) and b (from b and b), so gametes cb.\n\nWhen these combine, the F1 generation will have four combinations:\n- C (from CC) + c (from cc) = Cc\n- C (from CC) + b (from cc) = Cb\n- B (from BB) + c (from cc) = Bc\n- B (from BB) + b (from cc) = Bb\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are Cc, Cb, Bc, Bb. Each of these will translate into specific phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pecking (C): dominant C \u2192 checkered\n- Color (B): dominant B \u2192 red\n- If a bird is both checkered (C) and red (B), it's simply checkered red.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals will be checkered red.\n\nNow, the next part is about the F2 generation. Typically, F2 results from selfing F1 individuals. Since F1 is Cc, Cb, Bc, Bb, when they self, each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor each gene, the possible alleles after selfing are:\n- For C: C (homozygote) or Cc (heterozygote)\n- For B: B (homozygote) or Bb (heterozygote)\n- For c: cc (homozygote)\n- For b: bb (homozygote)\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 for each gene is as follows:\n- Gene C: Cc, Cc, Bc, Bb \u2192 actually, no. Wait, each parent gives one allele for each gene. So F1 for gene C comes from CC BB (C) and cc bb (c), so F1 Cc. Similarly, for gene B, F1 is Bb.\n\nWait, I think I got confused earlier. Let's clarify:\n\nEach parent is CC BB and cc bb. So for gene C:\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\nF1: Cc\n\nFor gene B:\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\nF1: Bb\n\nSo each F1 individual has genotype Cc for C and Bb for B.\n\nWhen F1 self-pollinate, the F2 will result from the combinations of these gametes.\n\nFor gene C:\n- From F1 Cc, gametes are C (25%) and c (75%)\n\nFor gene B:\n- From F1 Bb, gametes are B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nSince genes are independent, the F2 genotypes are combinations of Cc and Bb.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n- CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list all combinations:\n\nEach gene can have:\n- For C: C (dominant) or c (recessive)\n- For B: B (dominant) or b (recessive)\n\nThus, F2 genotypes for each gene:\n- C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotype combinations are all possible combinations of these.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nPecking (C):\n- Dominant C \u2192 Checkered (C)\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain (c)\n\nColor (B):\n- Dominant B \u2192 Red (B)\n- Recessive b \u2192 Brown (b)\n\nSo the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether they have C and/or B.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is a combination of their C and B alleles.\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\nThere are 9 possible F2 genotypes, each with a certain probability.\n\nBut since the question asks for phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the number based on probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the F2 distribution for each gene is 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Same for B.\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypic distribution can be calculated by considering all possible combinations.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nPhenotype | C status | B status | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered Red (C and B) | Yes | Yes | ?\nPlain Red (c and B) | No | Yes | ?\nCheckered Brown (C and b) | Yes | No | ?\nPlain Brown (c and b) | No | No | ?\n\nTo find the probabilities, we need to sum the probabilities where C is present and/or B is present.\n\nTotal possibilities:\n\n- C present: All cases except cc (but C could be absent or present)\n- B present: All cases except bb\n\nBut let's compute it correctly.\n\nEach bird has a 25% chance of CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc for C.\n\nSimilarly, for B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThe presence of C and B determines the phenotype.\n\nSo, the bird will be:\n\n- Checkered Red (C and B) if they have at least one C and at least one B.\n- Plain Red (c and B) if they have at least one C but no B.\n- Checkered Brown (C and b) if they have at least one C but no B.\n- Plain Brown (c and b) if they have neither C nor B.\n\nBut wait, in reality, since C is dominant and B is dominant, having even one C and one B leads to checkered red. Having one C and no B leads to plain red. Having one C and one b leads to checkered brown. And having none leads to plain brown.\n\nSo, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C and B):\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = (50% + 25%) * (50% + 25%) \n   Wait, no. Actually, the correct way is to multiply the probabilities of each allele being present.\n\nActually, the probability that C is present (C) is 75% (since 25% is cc, which doesn't have C).\nSimilarly, the probability that B is present (B) is 75%.\n\nBut since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability that both are present is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625, i.e., 56.25%.\n\n2. Plain Red (c and B):\n   - This occurs when C is absent (25% or cc) and B is present (75% or Bb or BB).\n\n   So probability = P(cc) * P(B present) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875, or 18.75%.\n\n3. Checkered Brown (C and b):\n   - This occurs when C is present (75%) and B is absent (25% or bb).\n\n   Probability = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875, or 18.75%.\n\n4. Plain Brown (c and b):\n   - This occurs when both C and B are absent (cc and bb).\n\n   Probability = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625, or 6.25%.\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered Red : Plain Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown = 56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\n\nTo simplify this ratio, we can divide each percentage by 6.25% to get whole numbers:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n\nSo the simplified ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nL. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nM. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nN. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nO. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nP. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nQ. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nR. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nS. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nT. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nU. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nV. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nW. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nX. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nY. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nZ. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nSo option K is 12, 2, 2, 0. That doesn't match our calculation of 9:3:3:1. Option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which also doesn't match. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which isn't matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the initial approach considered that all offspring are checkered red, but that can't be right because in the F1 cross, they were Cc Bb.

Checkered Red: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 C and B present.\n2. Plain Red: At least one C and no B \u2192 C present, B absent.\n3. Checkered Brown: At least one C and no B \u2192 C present, B absent.\n4. Plain Brown: Neither C nor B \u2192 cc bb.\n\nCalculating probabilities:\n\n- Total possible genotypes: 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, multiplied together).\n\nBut let's use probabilities for each gene:\n\nProbability of C present (C): 75% (since 25% is cc)\nProbability of B present (B): 75%\nProbability of C and B present: 75% * 75% = 56.25% (Checkered Red)\nProbability of C present and B absent: 75% * 25% = 18.75% (Plain Red)\nProbability of C present and B absent (same as above): 18.75% (Checkered Brown)\nProbability of neither C nor B present: 25% * 25% = 6.25% (Plain Brown)\n\nSo the ratio is 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nDividing each by 6.25 gives:\n\n56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n\n18.75 / 6.25 = 3",

    "rollout": " Let's start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, we have two birds crossed. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are the dominant ones for color and genotype. So that would be CC (since C is dominant) and BB for color because it's red. Wait, no\u2014wait, the colors are determined by separate genes. Oh right, each bird has two alleles for color (B and b) and two for genotype (C and c). So the parent CCBB must be homozygous for both color and genotype. \n\nThe other parent is a plain brown bird, which is ccbb. That makes sense because 'p' here refers to the recessive phenotype, but wait, actually in the problem statement, they're using 'c' as the recessive allele. Hmm, maybe I got confused there. Let me read again: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So 'b' is the recessive allele for color, meaning the bird is brown if it has bb. And 'c' is another allele for genotype, since 'C' and 'c' determine whether it's a checkered or plain bird.\n\nWait, so the first parent is CC BB? Because it's homozygous for both color and genotype. The second parent is cc bb. So their cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nNow, when you do a Punnett square for an aa \u00d7 Aa cross, you get a 1:1:1 ratio, but here it's more complex because both parents have multiple alleles. So let's think about each trait separately because they're independent.\n\nFor the genotype part, the parent with CC BB can only give either C or B. Wait, no\u2014the parent is CC BB, so all four alleles are C and B. But wait, no, that's not right. Actually, for a bird with two pairs of alleles, the genotype would be C C for one pair and B B for the other. So when producing gametes, each gamete will combine one allele from each pair. Since both parents are homozygous, each gamete from CC BB will be CB, and each gamete from cc bb will also be cb. So the F1 generation will receive one allele from each parent, making all gametes CB. Therefore, the F1 will be Cc Bb.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Parent 1 is CC BB. So the possible gametes are C and B for each pair. Parent 2 is cc bb, so the gametes will be c and b. So combining them, the F1 should have CC from parent 1 and cc from parent 2, giving Cc for the genotype. Similarly, for the other pair, BB from parent 1 and bb from parent 2, giving Bb. So F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 x F1 would produce a dihybrid cross. Each parent contributes one allele for each trait. So for the genotype, each parent can contribute C or c for the first trait and B or b for the second trait. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC, Cc, Cc, cc (phenotype depends on dominance)\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as above.\n\nSo the F2 would be based on these combinations. However, the question mentions F2, but in the initial description, it says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Maybe the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1, and then F1 x F1 resulting in F2. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are different, like one being CC BB and the other being cc bb, leading to F1 being Cc Bb, and then F1 x F1 being F2.\n\nLet me clarify the cross: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). So their offspring (F1) will be Cc Bb, as each trait is inherited independently.\n\nThen, F1 (Cc Bb) x F1 (Cc Bb) will produce F2. To find the phenotypes, we need to consider the inheritance for each trait separately.\n\nFor the color trait (B and b), since B is dominant, any B allele results in red. If bb, then brown. For the genotype (C and c), C is dominant, so any C results in a checkered pattern. If cc, then plain.\n\nSo the F2 will have the following possibilities:\n\n- For color:\n  - BB: red\n  - Bb: red\n  - bb: brown\n- For genotype:\n  - CC: checkered\n  - Cc: checkered\n  - cc: plain\n\nTo calculate the probabilities, we can use a Punnett square for each trait. Since the traits are independent, we multiply the probabilities.\n\nFor the color trait:\n\nProbability of BB = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 red\nProbability of Bb = 2*(1/2*1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 red\nProbability of bb = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 brown\n\nFor the genotype trait:\n\nProbability of CC = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 checkered\nProbability of Cc = 2*(1/2)(1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 checkered\nProbability of cc = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \u2192 plain\n\nSince the traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for example, the probability of having red and checkered is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. But wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Because the color and genotype are separate traits, the overall probability isn't just the product of individual probabilities. Instead, for each combination, we take the product.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the entire F2 population considering both traits together. But maybe it's easier to list all possible combinations and count the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, since each trait follows a Mendelian distribution, the F2 will have the following phenotypic ratios:\n\nFor each trait, the F2 will have 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But since the two traits are independent, the combined ratios are 25% for each color combination multiplied by each genotype combination.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that for each trait, the F2 will have the same ratio as F1, because each trait is segregating independently. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that the F2 will have the same ratios as F1, but that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the F1 is Cc Bb, so F2 will result from F1 x F1, which is a dihybrid cross. The F2 phenotypic ratio for two traits each with a 1:2:1 ratio is 9:3:3:1. But that doesn\u2019t seem right because each trait is broken into three categories (red, red-brown, brown), so the combined phenotypes would be nine categories, but grouped into three main phenotypes (red, brown, plain).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at each trait individually and then see how they interact. But given time constraints, perhaps looking up the standard dihybrid cross ratios.\n\nIn general, for two independently assorting traits, the F2 generation will have a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1 for the four possible combinations. But since each trait can have three phenotypes (red, red-brown, brown), the total number of phenotypes increases, but the actual observed ratios depend on the dominance relationships.\n\nHowever, the problem states to show the expected phenotypic ratios. Given that, the correct answer is likely option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nBut let me double-check by calculating the proportions. For each trait:\n\nRed: 25%\nBrown: 25%\nCheckered: 50%\n\nCombined, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% * 50% = 12.5% of the population\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% \n- Plain red: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- Plain brown: 12.5%\n\nAdding them up gives 50% + 50% = 100%, but since the problem lists four phenotypes, perhaps the ratio is 9:3:3:1 across all four, but grouped into two main phenotypes (checkered vs plain) and two others (red vs brown). Alternatively, the ratio could be 9:3:3:1, but grouped into two main categories: checkered and plain, each with 50% (so 1:1 within each category), and red and brown each with 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the number of each phenotype in F2. Since each trait is independent, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nFor each phenotype combination:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both genotype and color are checkered.\n   - Genotype: CC (50%) or Cc (50%) \u2192 Wait, no: genotype is 50% Cc (checkered) and 50% cc (plain).\n   - Color: 50% red, 50% brown.\n   - So, for checkered red: (50% genotype) * (50% color) = 25% of the population.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2. Checkered brown: (50% genotype) * (50% color) = 25%.\n\n3. Plain red: (50% genotype) * (50% color) = 25%.\n\n4. Plain brown: Same as above: 25%.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would sum to 100%. But the options don't match this. Perhaps the problem considers that some phenotypes overlap in terms of color and genotype.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's instead look at the actual F2 phenotypes:\n\nEach F2 bird has a genotype and a color. The color is determined by whether it's red (B present) or brown (bb). The genotype is determined by whether it's checkered (C present) or plain (cc).\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: genotype CC or Cc, color red (B present)\n2. Checkered brown: genotype cc, color brown (bb)\n3. Plain red: genotype cc, color red (B absent)\n4. Plain brown: genotype CC or Cc, color brown (bb)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability genotype is Cc) * (probability color is red)\n  - Probability genotype is Cc: 50% (from F1)\n  - Probability color is red: 50% (from F1)\n  - So 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\n- Checkered brown: (probability genotype is cc) * (probability color is brown)\n  - Probability genotype cc: 25% (from F1)\n  - Probability color brown: 50%\n  - So 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n\n- Plain red: (probability genotype is cc) * (probability color is red)\n  - 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\n- Plain brown: (probability genotype is Cc or CC) * (probability color is brown)\n  - Probability genotype is Cc or CC: 75%\n  - So 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 \u2192 37.5%\n\nWait, but none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nHmm, my calculation shows that checkered red is 25%, checkered brown 12.5%, plain red 12.5%, plain brown 37.5%. None of the options match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try building the F2 square correctly.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nEach parent produces gametes:\n\n- Parent 1: C and B for each allele.\n- Parent 2: c and b for each allele.\n\nF1 will be Cc Bb.\n\nF1 x F1:\n\nEach F1 bird produces four types of gametes: CB, Cb, bB, bc.\n\nSo F2 genotypes:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC, CB, BC, BB\n- CB x Cb: CC, Cc, Cc, cc, etc. Wait, better to use a Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F2 grid would look like:\n\n          | Cc    | c      |\n        -----------------\n         Cc     | Cc\u00d7Cc=CC (25%), Cc\u00d7c= Cc (50%), c\u00d7Cc= Cc (50%), c\u00d7c= cc (25%)  \n        c       | Cc\u00d7c= Cc (25%), c\u00d7Cc= cc (25%), c\u00d7c= cc (25%)        \nSo overall:\n\n- CC: 25% + 25% = 50% (but wait, no\u2014each cell adds up, so CC occurs in 25% (from Cc x Cc) and 25% (from c x Cc?), no, wait:\n\nWait, actually, the Punnett square for two Cc x cc parents (assuming F1 is Cc and cc):\n\nNo, wait, F1 is Cc Bb, so F2 is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb. So each parent is Cc Bb, so F2 is:\n\nGenotype: Cc \u00d7 Cc in one dimension, Bb \u00d7 Bb in the other.\n\nSo the Punnett square for Cc x Cc:\n\nCC 50%, Cc 50%, cc 50%\n\nAnd for Bb x Bb:\n\nBB 25%, Bb 50%, bb 25%\n\nSo the F2 for color (Bb x Bb) is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nFor genotype (Cc x Cc):\n\nCC 25%, Cc 50%, cc 25%.\n\nSo the combined F2 phenotype counts are:\n\nColor:\n- BB: 25% of the population\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nGenotype:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by both color and genotype. So:\n\n- CC + BB: Checkered red\n- CC + Bb: Checkered brown\n- CC + bb: Plain red\n- Cc + BB: Checkered red\n- Cc + Bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc + bb: Plain red\n- cc + BB: Plain brown\n- cc + Bb: Plain brown\n- cc + bb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain brown: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n\nWait, but that seems off because 50% + 50% = 100%, but when adding up, the total is indeed 100%. However, the problem asks to group the phenotypes into two main categories: checkered vs plain, and red vs brown.\n\nGrouped:\n\n- Checkered: 50% (red and brown)\n- Plain: 50% (red and brown)\n\nWithin Checkered:\n\n- Red: 25% of Checkered \u2192 25% of total\n- Brown: 50% of Checkered \u2192 50% of total\n\nWait, no, within Checkered, it's 25% red (from CC) and 50% brown (from Cc). So overall, Checkered red is 25% of the population, Checkered brown is 50%, Plain red is 25%, Plain brown is 50%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none of them perfectly match this except option D: 1, 3, 9, 3.\n\nWait, option D is 1, 3, 9, 3, which corresponds to:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (maybe 1/9)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (maybe 3/9)\n- Plain red: 9 (maybe 9/12 or 3/4)\n- Plain brown: 3 (maybe 3/12)\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, the ratios should be 25%, 50%, 25%, 50%. So perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the F2 ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: each trait is segregating independently, so the F2 population will have:\n\n- 25% BB (red)\n- 50% Bb (red)\n- 25% bb (brown)\n- 50% CC (checkered)\n- 50% Cc (checkered)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach treats each trait separately without considering their interaction. But in reality, both traits influence the phenotype, so the correct way is to combine the effects.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nBut my earlier calculation showed 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, etc., which doesn't align with any of the options. Option E suggests 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 generation will have the following ratios:\n\n- For each trait, 25% red, 50% brown, 25% plain.\n\nSo combined, for the four phenotypes, the ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% * 50% = 12.5% (or 1/8)\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% (or ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, we have two birds crossed. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are the dominant ones for color and genotype. So that would be CC (since C is dominant) and BB for color because it's red. Wait, no\u2014wait, the colors are determined by separate genes. Oh right, each bird has two alleles for color (B and b) and two for genotype (C and c). So the parent CCBB must be homozygous for both color and genotype. \n\nThe other parent is a plain brown bird, which is ccbb. That makes sense because 'p' here refers to the recessive phenotype, but wait, actually in the problem statement, they're using 'c' as the recessive allele. Hmm, maybe I got confused there. Let me read again: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So 'b' is the recessive allele for color, meaning the bird is brown if it has bb. And 'c' is another allele for genotype, since 'C' and 'c' determine whether it's a checkered or plain bird.\n\nWait, so the first parent is CC BB? Because it's homozygous for both color and genotype. The second parent is cc bb. So their cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nNow, when you do a Punnett square for an aa \u00d7 Aa cross, you get a 1:1:1 ratio, but here it's more complex because both parents have multiple alleles. So let's think about each trait separately because they're independent.\n\nFor the genotype part, the parent with CC BB can only give either C or B. Wait, no\u2014the parent is CC BB, so all four alleles are C and B. But wait, no, that's not right. Actually, for a bird with two pairs of alleles, the genotype would be C C for one pair and B B for the other. So when producing gametes, each gamete will combine one allele from each pair. Since both parents are homozygous, each gamete from CC BB will be CB, and each gamete from cc bb will also be cb. So the F1 generation will receive one allele from each parent, making all gametes CB. Therefore, the F1 will be Cc Bb.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Parent 1 is CC BB. So the possible gametes are C and B for each pair. Parent 2 is cc bb, so the gametes will be c and b. So combining them, the F1 should have CC from parent 1 and cc from parent 2, giving Cc for the genotype. Similarly, for the other pair, BB from parent 1 and bb from parent 2, giving Bb. So F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 x F1 would produce a dihybrid cross. Each parent contributes one allele for each trait. So for the genotype, each parent can contribute C or c for the first trait and B or b for the second trait. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC, Cc, Cc, cc (phenotype depends on dominance)\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as above.\n\nSo the F2 would be based on these combinations. However, the question mentions F2, but in the initial description, it says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Maybe the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1, and then F1 x F1 resulting in F2. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are different, like one being CC BB and the other being cc bb, leading to F1 being Cc Bb, and then F1 x F1 being F2.\n\nLet me clarify the cross: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). So their offspring (F1) will be Cc Bb, as each trait is inherited independently.\n\nThen, F1 (Cc Bb) x F1 (Cc Bb) will produce F2. To find the phenotypes, we need to consider the inheritance for each trait separately.\n\nFor the color trait (B and b), since B is dominant, any B allele results in red. If bb, then brown. For the genotype (C and c), C is dominant, so any C results in a checkered pattern. If cc, then plain.\n\nSo the F2 will have the following possibilities:\n\n- For color:\n  - BB: red\n  - Bb: red\n  - bb: brown\n- For genotype:\n  - CC: checkered\n  - Cc: checkered\n  - cc: plain\n\nTo calculate the probabilities, we can use a Punnett square for each trait. Since the traits are independent, we multiply the probabilities.\n\nFor the color trait:\n\nProbability of BB = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 red\nProbability of Bb = 2*(1/2*1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 red\nProbability of bb = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 brown\n\nFor the genotype trait:\n\nProbability of CC = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 checkered\nProbability of Cc = 2*(1/2)(1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 checkered\nProbability of cc = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \u2192 plain\n\nSince the traits are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for example, the probability of having red and checkered is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16. But wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Because the color and genotype are separate traits, the overall probability isn't just the product of individual probabilities. Instead, for each combination, we take the product.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model the entire F2 population considering both traits together. But maybe it's easier to list all possible combinations and count the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, since each trait follows a Mendelian distribution, the F2 will have the following phenotypic ratios:\n\nFor each trait, the F2 will have 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But since the two traits are independent, the combined ratios are 25% for each color combination multiplied by each genotype combination.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that for each trait, the F2 will have the same ratio as F1, because each trait is segregating independently. Wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that the F2 will have the same ratios as F1, but that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the F1 is Cc Bb, so F2 will result from F1 x F1, which is a dihybrid cross. The F2 phenotypic ratio for two traits each with a 1:2:1 ratio is 9:3:3:1. But that doesn\u2019t seem right because each trait is broken into three categories (red, red-brown, brown), so the combined phenotypes would be nine categories, but grouped into three main phenotypes (red, brown, plain).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at each trait individually and then see how they interact. But given time constraints, perhaps looking up the standard dihybrid cross ratios.\n\nIn general, for two independently assorting traits, the F2 generation will have a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1 for the four possible combinations. But since each trait can have three phenotypes (red, red-brown, brown), the total number of phenotypes increases, but the actual observed ratios depend on the dominance relationships.\n\nHowever, the problem states to show the expected phenotypic ratios. Given that, the correct answer is likely option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nBut let me double-check by calculating the proportions. For each trait:\n\nRed: 25%\nBrown: 25%\nCheckered: 50%\n\nCombined, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% * 50% = 12.5% of the population\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% \n- Plain red: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- Plain brown: 12.5%\n\nAdding them up gives 50% + 50% = 100%, but since the problem lists four phenotypes, perhaps the ratio is 9:3:3:1 across all four, but grouped into two main phenotypes (checkered vs plain) and two others (red vs brown). Alternatively, the ratio could be 9:3:3:1, but grouped into two main categories: checkered and plain, each with 50% (so 1:1 within each category), and red and brown each with 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the number of each phenotype in F2. Since each trait is independent, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nFor each phenotype combination:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both genotype and color are checkered.\n   - Genotype: CC (50%) or Cc (50%) \u2192 Wait, no: genotype is 50% Cc (checkered) and 50% cc (plain).\n   - Color: 50% red, 50% brown.\n   - So, for checkered red: (50% genotype) * (50% color) = 25% of the population.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2. Checkered brown: (50% genotype) * (50% color) = 25%.\n\n3. Plain red: (50% genotype) * (50% color) = 25%.\n\n4. Plain brown: Same as above: 25%.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would sum to 100%. But the options don't match this. Perhaps the problem considers that some phenotypes overlap in terms of color and genotype.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's instead look at the actual F2 phenotypes:\n\nEach F2 bird has a genotype and a color. The color is determined by whether it's red (B present) or brown (bb). The genotype is determined by whether it's checkered (C present) or plain (cc).\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: genotype CC or Cc, color red (B present)\n2. Checkered brown: genotype cc, color brown (bb)\n3. Plain red: genotype cc, color red (B absent)\n4. Plain brown: genotype CC or Cc, color brown (bb)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability genotype is Cc) * (probability color is red)\n  - Probability genotype is Cc: 50% (from F1)\n  - Probability color is red: 50% (from F1)\n  - So 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\n- Checkered brown: (probability genotype is cc) * (probability color is brown)\n  - Probability genotype cc: 25% (from F1)\n  - Probability color brown: 50%\n  - So 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n\n- Plain red: (probability genotype is cc) * (probability color is red)\n  - 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\n- Plain brown: (probability genotype is Cc or CC) * (probability color is brown)\n  - Probability genotype is Cc or CC: 75%\n  - So 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 \u2192 37.5%\n\nWait, but none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nHmm, my calculation shows that checkered red is 25%, checkered brown 12.5%, plain red 12.5%, plain brown 37.5%. None of the options match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try building the F2 square correctly.\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nEach parent produces gametes:\n\n- Parent 1: C and B for each allele.\n- Parent 2: c and b for each allele.\n\nF1 will be Cc Bb.\n\nF1 x F1:\n\nEach F1 bird produces four types of gametes: CB, Cb, bB, bc.\n\nSo F2 genotypes:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC, CB, BC, BB\n- CB x Cb: CC, Cc, Cc, cc, etc. Wait, better to use a Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F2 grid would look like:\n\n          | Cc    | c      |\n        -----------------\n         Cc     | Cc\u00d7Cc=CC (25%), Cc\u00d7c= Cc (50%), c\u00d7Cc= Cc (50%), c\u00d7c= cc (25%)  \n        c       | Cc\u00d7c= Cc (25%), c\u00d7Cc= cc (25%), c\u00d7c= cc (25%)        \nSo overall:\n\n- CC: 25% + 25% = 50% (but wait, no\u2014each cell adds up, so CC occurs in 25% (from Cc x Cc) and 25% (from c x Cc?), no, wait:\n\nWait, actually, the Punnett square for two Cc x cc parents (assuming F1 is Cc and cc):\n\nNo, wait, F1 is Cc Bb, so F2 is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb. So each parent is Cc Bb, so F2 is:\n\nGenotype: Cc \u00d7 Cc in one dimension, Bb \u00d7 Bb in the other.\n\nSo the Punnett square for Cc x Cc:\n\nCC 50%, Cc 50%, cc 50%\n\nAnd for Bb x Bb:\n\nBB 25%, Bb 50%, bb 25%\n\nSo the F2 for color (Bb x Bb) is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nFor genotype (Cc x Cc):\n\nCC 25%, Cc 50%, cc 25%.\n\nSo the combined F2 phenotype counts are:\n\nColor:\n- BB: 25% of the population\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nGenotype:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by both color and genotype. So:\n\n- CC + BB: Checkered red\n- CC + Bb: Checkered brown\n- CC + bb: Plain red\n- Cc + BB: Checkered red\n- Cc + Bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc + bb: Plain red\n- cc + BB: Plain brown\n- cc + Bb: Plain brown\n- cc + bb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain brown: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n\nWait, but that seems off because 50% + 50% = 100%, but when adding up, the total is indeed 100%. However, the problem asks to group the phenotypes into two main categories: checkered vs plain, and red vs brown.\n\nGrouped:\n\n- Checkered: 50% (red and brown)\n- Plain: 50% (red and brown)\n\nWithin Checkered:\n\n- Red: 25% of Checkered \u2192 25% of total\n- Brown: 50% of Checkered \u2192 50% of total\n\nWait, no, within Checkered, it's 25% red (from CC) and 50% brown (from Cc). So overall, Checkered red is 25% of the population, Checkered brown is 50%, Plain red is 25%, Plain brown is 50%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none of them perfectly match this except option D: 1, 3, 9, 3.\n\nWait, option D is 1, 3, 9, 3, which corresponds to:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (maybe 1/9)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (maybe 3/9)\n- Plain red: 9 (maybe 9/12 or 3/4)\n- Plain brown: 3 (maybe 3/12)\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, the ratios should be 25%, 50%, 25%, 50%. So perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the F2 ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: each trait is segregating independently, so the F2 population will have:\n\n- 25% BB (red)\n- 50% Bb (red)\n- 25% bb (brown)\n- 50% CC (checkered)\n- 50% Cc (checkered)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach treats each trait separately without considering their interaction. But in reality, both traits influence the phenotype, so the correct way is to combine the effects.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nBut my earlier calculation showed 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, etc., which doesn't align with any of the options. Option E suggests 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 generation will have the following ratios:\n\n- For each trait, 25% red, 50% brown, 25% plain.\n\nSo combined, for the four phenotypes, the ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% * 50% = 12.5% (or 1/8)\n- Checkered brown: 12.5% (or ",

    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe problem involves two birds crossing their genes, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio after an F2 generation. The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. The checkered pattern is controlled by the dominant gene C, which means it's expressed over the recessive c. Plain color is from the recessive allele c. Red is determined by a dominant gene B, while brown is from the recessive allele b.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the possible alleles each parent can pass on:\n\n- Parent 1 (homozygous checkered red): genotype is CC_B_ (since they're red, not brown). So both parents contribute C and B.\n  \nWait, no, actually, wait. The parents are described as checkered red and plain brown. So for the first parent, since it's a checkered pattern, that would mean both C and B are present because checkered patterns are usually heterozygous. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nActually, checkered patterns in birds might refer to having both dominant and recessive traits, but perhaps more accurately, the pattern refers to having both C and c alleles or something else. Wait, the question says \"checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense because checkered patterns are often due to multiple genes, but maybe in this context, it's referring to having both C and c alleles, resulting in a checkered pattern. Similarly, plain color could be either C or c, depending on which allele is dominant.\n\nBut let's go back to the problem. The parents are:\n\n1. Homozygous checkered red: Since it's checkered, it must have both C and c? Or maybe just one dominant and one recessive? Wait, but if it's checkered, it probably has both C and c alleles. However, red is determined by B, so perhaps the presence of B makes it red, and the absence makes it another color. Wait, maybe I should clarify this.\n\nWait, the checkered pattern is determined by a dominant gene C, meaning that at least one C allele results in the checkered pattern. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c, meaning that without c, you get a particular color. Red is B, which is dominant, so if there's a B allele, the bird is red. Brown is b, which is recessive, so without a b allele, the bird is brown.\n\nSo, let's restate:\n\n- Dominant alleles:\n  - C: Checkered pattern (dominant)\n  - B: Red color (dominant)\n\n- Recessive alleles:\n  - c: Plain color (recessive)\n  - b: Brown color (recessive)\n\nNow, the parents are:\n\n1. Homozygous checkered red: Since it's checkered, this must be CC_B_, but wait, that's impossible because a homozygous bird would have two identical alleles. So perhaps it's CC_B_ where both alleles are C and B. But actually, checkered patterns might require both dominant traits, so maybe it's CB_C_. Alternatively, perhaps it's a heterozygote for the pattern, like CC and then for the color, it's BB, making it red. But I'm getting confused here. Maybe the correct way is to consider that the first parent is CC_B_, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's CC_B_ where C is dominant for pattern and B is dominant for color, but in reality, the combination determines the phenotype. Wait, perhaps the first parent is CC_B_, but that's not possible because you can't have a third allele. Maybe the first parent is CC and B, making it red, and the second parent is cc and b, making it brown. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, Parent 1: CC_B_ \u2192 since it's homozygous for the pattern, both alleles are C, and since it's red, the color must be determined by B. So, the phenotype is red.\n\nParent 2: cc_b_ \u2192 since it's homozygous for the plain color (because it's recessive), all its offspring will be brown, right? Because bb is brown.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the first parent is checkered red, and the second is plain brown. So, Parent 1: CC_B_ (assuming both alleles are C and B?), but that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the first parent is CC_B_, but that would imply a third allele, which isn't present. Maybe the first parent is CC_B_, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the first parent is CC_B_ meaning that both are dominant for both traits, making them red. And the second parent is cc_b_, making them brown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first parent is CC (for pattern) and B (for color), making it red. The second parent is cc (plain color) and b (brown), making it brown.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So Parent 1: CC_B_ \u2192 red, checkered pattern. Parent 2: cc_b_ \u2192 brown, plain color.\n\nNow, when these two birds mate, the F1 generation will receive one allele from each parent. From Parent 1: C and B. From Parent 2: c and b. So the gametes would be C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b.\n\nWait, no, the F1 parents are CcBb and ccbb. Wait, no, let's look back at the question. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So Parent 1 is CC_B_ (red, checkered), and Parent 2 is cc_b_ (brown, plain).\n\nWhen they cross, the F1 would be CcBb and ccBb and Ccbb and ccbb? Wait, no, let me correct that. The F1 generation comes from crossing CC_B_ (red, checkered) and cc_b_ (brown, plain). So each parent contributes one allele for each trait. So Parent 1 gives C/B and c/b. Parent 2 gives c/b and cc? Wait, no, Parent 2 is cc_b_: so it's cc for the plain color and b for brown.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC_B_ \u2192 this is homozygous for both dominant traits, so they are red and checkered. So their gametes are C/B and c/b.\n\nParent 2: cc_b_ \u2192 homozygous for the plain color (so cc) and brown (so b). Their gametes are c/b and cc? No, wait, they're cc for the plain color (so cc is the genotype) and b for brown. So their gametes are c/b.\n\nWait, no, actually, in crosses, the F1 generation gets one allele from each parent. So Parent 1 (CC_B_) can produce C/B and c/b gametes. Parent 2 (cc_b_) can produce c/b and cc? No, wait, no. Parent 2 is cc_b_, so it can produce c/b gametes. Because it's homozygous for the plain color (cc) and homozygous for brown (bb)? Wait, no, brown is determined by the recessive allele b. So, Parent 2 is cc (plain) and b (brown). So their gametes would be c/b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of four combinations:\n\nFrom Parent 1: C/B and c/b\n\nFrom Parent 2: c/b\n\nSo combining, the possible gametes for F1 are:\n\n- C/B (from Parent 1) + c/b (from Parent 2) = Cc Bb\n\n- c/b (from Parent 1) + c/b (from Parent 2) = cc bb\n\nWait, but that can't be right because Parent 2 is cc_b_, so their gamete would be c/b. So combining with Parent 1's gametes:\n\n- C/B + c/b = Cc Bb\n\n- c/b + c/b = cc bb\n\nWait, that's only two possibilities. But the original F1 parents were CcBb and ccbb. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps Parent 1 is CC_B_ (so C and B) and Parent 2 is cc_b_ (so c and b). Therefore, the F1 would be Cc Bb and cc bb. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo F1 parents are CcBb and ccbb.\n\nThen, the next step is to determine the F2 generation. To do that, I need to know the genotypes of the F1 parents. CcBb \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nEach F1 individual can produce four types of gametes based on Mendel's laws. So, for CcBb:\n\n- For the C locus (pattern): C (dominant) and c (recessive)\n- For the B locus (color): B (dominant) and b (recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for ccbb:\n\n- For the C locus: c (recessive)\n- For the B locus: b (recessive)\n\nSo the gametes from CcBb will be:\n\n- C/B: 25%\n- C/b: 25%\n- c/B: 25%\n- c/b: 25%\n\nAnd the gametes from ccbb will be:\n\n- c/b: 100% (since it's homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nSo the F2 generation will be a result of these gametes mixing.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, I need to consider the genotypes and the corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pattern (C/c):\n  - If at least one C, pattern is checkered (dominant).\n  - Otherwise, pattern is plain (recessive).\n\n- Color (B/b):\n  - If at least one B, color is red (dominant).\n  - Otherwise, color is brown (recessive).\n\nSo, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nBut before that, I should note the probabilities of each genotype in the F2 generation. Since F1 is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nParental gametes: 25% C/B, 25% C/b, 25% c/B, 25% c/b.\n\nParent 1 (CcBb) contributes C/B and c/b.\n\nParent 2 (ccbb) contributes c/b.\n\nSo the F2 for C locus:\n\n- C/B \u00d7 c/b: 25% C/B \u00d7 c/b = C c B b\n- C/B \u00d7 ccbb: 25% C/B \u00d7 ccbb = C c cc bb\n- c/B \u00d7 c/b: 25% c/B \u00d7 c/b = c c B b\n- c/B \u00d7 ccbb: 25% c/B \u00d7 ccbb = c c cc bb\n\nWait, but for the F2 generation, each F1 parent produces gametes, so the total number of gametes is 4 (from F1) \u00d7 1 (from ccbb) = 4 gametes for each parent. But since F1 is selfing, I think I need to calculate the F2 based on the F1 parents producing gametes.\n\nAlternatively, using Punnett squares. Let's create a Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nWait, no, F1 is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb. So F1 parents are CcBb and ccbb.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will come from the F1 parents' gametes.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nFrom CcBb, gametes are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b.\n\nFrom ccbb, gametes are c/b.\n\nSo the F2 C locus genotypes are:\n\n- C/B \u00d7 c/b = C c B b\n- C/b \u00d7 c/b = C c c b\n- c/B \u00d7 c/b = c c B b\n- c/b \u00d7 c/b = c c c b\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\nFrom CcBb, gametes: B and b.\n\nFrom ccbb, gametes: b.\n\nSo F2 B locus genotypes:\n\n- B \u00d7 b = B b\n- b \u00d7 b = b b\n\nPutting it together, F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CcBb: 25% (from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb)\n- Ccbb: 25% (from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb)\n- ccBb: 25% (from ccbb \u00d7 ccbb)\n- ccbb: 25% (from ccbb \u00d7 ccbb)\n\nWait, no, because the F1s are CcBb and ccbb. Each F1 produces four gametes, so the F2 will have 16 possible combinations. But considering dominance, some will combine into the same phenotype.\n\nLet me approach this systematically.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nPossible gametes:\n\n- C/B (25%)\n\n- C/b (25%)\n\n- c/B (25%)\n\n- c/b (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nPossible gametes:\n\n- B (25%)\n\n- b (75%)\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the B locus, the F1 is CcBb, so gametes are B and b. The other F1 is ccbb, so gametes are b. So the F2 for the B locus will be:\n\n- B (25%) from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb\n\n- b (25% \u00d7 25%) from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb\n\n- b (25%) from ccbb \u00d7 ccbb\n\nWait, no, I think I'm complicating this. Let's instead use the standard method for calculating F2 ratios.\n\nSince F1 is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb, the F2 will have the following probabilities for each locus:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nProbability of C (C/B): 25%, C (c/B): 25%, c (c/B): 25%, c (c/b): 25%.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the F1 is CcBb. When crossed with ccbb, the F2 will have:\n\nFor C locus:\n\nProbability of C (C/B) = 25% (from Cc) \u00d7 100% (ccbb) = 25%\n\nProbability of c (c/B) = 25% (from cc) \u00d7 100% (ccbb) = 25%\n\nSimilarly for B locus:\n\nIn F1, for the B locus, the gametes are B (25%) and b (75%). But since the other parent is ccbb, which only contributes b, the F2 B locus will be:\n\n- B (25% \u00d7 100%) = 25%\n\n- b (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb. So for the B locus, the gametes are B (25%) and b (75%).\n\nThe other parent is ccbb, so gametes are b (100%).\n\nThus, F2 B locus genotypes:\n\n- B \u00d7 b = Bb (25%)\n\n- b \u00d7 b = bb (75%)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Bb \u2192 B (dominant) \u2192 red\n\n- bb \u2192 b (recessive) \u2192 brown\n\nSimilarly, for the C locus:\n\nF1 is CcBb. Gametes: C (25%), c (75%).\n\nOther parent is ccbb, so gametes: c (100%).\n\nThus, F2 C locus genotypes:\n\n- C \u00d7 c = Cc (25%)\n\n- c \u00d7 c = cc (75%)\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Cc \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n\n- cc \u2192 c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nSo now, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C locus: 25% Cc, 75% cc\n\nFor B locus: 25% Bb, 75% bb\n\nNow, the F2 individuals will have combinations of these:\n\n- 25% (Cc) \u00d7 25% (Bb) = CcBb\n\n- 25% (Cc) \u00d7 75% (bb) = Ccbb\n\n- 75% (cc) \u00d7 25% (Bb) = ccBb\n\n- 75% (cc) \u00d7 75% (bb) = ccbb\n\nBut we need to group these into phenotypes.\n\nNow, let's map the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: C (checkered) and B (red) \u2192 checkered red\n\n- Ccbb: C (checkered) and b (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n\n- ccBb: c (plain) and B (red) \u2192 plain red\n\n- ccbb: c (plain) and b (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNext, calculate the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CcBb occurs 25% of the time.\n\n- Ccbb occurs 25% of the time.\n\n- ccBb occurs 75% of the time.\n\n- ccbb occurs 75% of the time.\n\nWait, no, because the F2 counts are as follows:\n\n- CcBb: 25% (from Cc \u00d7 Bb)\n\n- Ccbb: 25% (from Cc \u00d7 bb)\n\n- ccBb: 75% (from cc \u00d7 Bb)\n\n- ccbb: 75% (from cc \u00d7 bb)\n\nWait, but each of these will contribute to different phenotypes based on their genotype.\n\nSo:\n\n- CcBb: checkered red (phenotype count: 25%)\n\n- Ccbb: checkered brown (phenotype count: 25%)\n\n- ccBb: plain red (phenotype count: 75%)\n\n- ccbb: plain brown (phenotype count: 75%)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% : 25% : 75% : 75%. Simplifying, dividing each by 25%, we get 1:1:3:3.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Not matching our 1:1:3:3.\n\nB.

Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe problem involves two birds crossing their genes, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio after an F2 generation. The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. The checkered pattern is controlled by the dominant gene C, which means it's expressed over the recessive c. Plain color is from the recessive allele c. Red is determined by a dominant gene B, while brown is from the recessive allele b.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the possible alleles each parent can pass on:\n\n- Parent 1 (homozygous checkered red): genotype is CC_B_ (since they're red, not brown). So both parents contribute C and B.\n  \nWait, no, actually, wait. The parents are described as checkered red and plain brown. So for the first parent, since it's a checkered pattern, that would mean both C and B are present because checkered patterns are usually heterozygous. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c, meaning that without c, you get a particular color. Red is B, which is dominant, so if there's a B allele, the bird is red. Brown is b, which is recessive, so without a b allele, the bird is brown.\n\nSo, let's restate:\n\n- Dominant alleles:\n  - C: Checkered pattern (dominant)\n  - B: Red color (dominant)\n\n- Recessive alleles:\n  - c: Plain color (recessive)\n  - b: Brown color (recessive)\n\nNow, the parents are:\n\n1. Homozygous checkered red: Since it's checkered, this must be CC_B_, but wait, that's impossible because a homozygous bird would have two identical alleles.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CC_B_ where C is dominant for pattern and B is dominant for color, but in reality, the combination determines the phenotype. Wait, perhaps the first parent is CC_B_, but that's not possible because you can't have a third allele. Maybe the first parent is CC and B, making it red, and the second parent is cc and b, making it brown. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, Parent 1: CC_B_ \u2192 since it's homozygous for the pattern, both alleles are C, and since it's red, the color must be determined by B. So, the phenotype is red.\n\nParent 2: cc_b_ \u2192 since it's homozygous for the plain color (because it's recessive), all its offspring will be brown, right? Because bb is brown.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the first parent is checkered red, and the second is plain brown. So, Parent 1: CC_B_ (assuming both alleles are C and B?), but that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the first parent is CC_B_, but that would imply a third allele, which isn't present. Maybe the first parent is CC_B_, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the first parent is CC_B_ meaning that both are dominant for both traits, making them red. And the second parent is cc_b_, making them brown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first parent is CC (for pattern) and B (for color), making it red. The second parent is cc (plain color) and b (brown), making it brown.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So Parent 1: CC_B_ \u2192 red, checkered pattern. Parent 2: cc_b_ \u2192 brown, plain color.\n\nNow, when these two birds mate, the F1 generation will receive one allele from each parent. From Parent 1: C and B. From Parent 2: c and b. So the gametes would be C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b.\n\nWait, no, the F1 parents are CcBb and ccbb. Wait, no, let's look back at the question. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So Parent 1 is CC_B_ (red, checkered), and Parent 2 is cc_b_ (brown, plain).\n\nWhen they cross, the F1 would be CcBb and ccBb and Ccbb and ccbb? Wait, no, let me correct that. The F1 generation comes from crossing CC_B_ (red, checkered) and cc_b_ (brown, plain). So each parent contributes one allele for each trait. So Parent 1 gives C/B and c/b. Parent 2 gives c/b and cc? Wait, no, Parent 2 is cc_b_: so it's cc for the plain color and b for brown.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC_B_ \u2192 this is homozygous for both dominant traits, so they are red and checkered. So their gametes are C/B and c/b.\n\nParent 2: cc_b_ \u2192 homozygous for the plain color (so cc) and brown (so b). Their gametes are c/b and cc? No, wait, they're cc for the plain color (so cc is the genotype) and b for brown. So their gametes are c/b.\n\nWait, no, actually, in crosses, the F1 generation gets one allele from each parent. So Parent 1 (CC_B_) can produce C/B and c/b gametes. Parent 2 (cc_b_) can produce c/b and cc? No, wait, no. Parent 2 is cc_b_, so it can produce c/b gametes. Because it's homozygous for the plain color (cc) and homozygous for brown (bb)? Wait, no, brown is determined by the recessive allele b. So, Parent 2 is cc (plain) and b (brown). So their gametes would be c/b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of four combinations:\n\nFrom Parent 1: C/B and c/b\n\nFrom Parent 2: c/b\n\nSo combining, the possible gametes for F1 are:\n\n- C/B (from Parent 1) + c/b (from Parent 2) = Cc Bb\n\n- c/b (from Parent 1) + c/b (from Parent 2) = cc bb\n\nWait, but that can't be right because Parent 2 is cc_b_, so their gamete would be c/b. So combining with Parent 1's gametes:\n\n- C/B + c/b = Cc Bb\n\n- c/b + c/b = cc bb\n\nWait, that's only two possibilities. But the original F1 parents were CcBb and ccbb. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps Parent 1 is CC_B_ (so C and B) and Parent 2 is cc_b_ (so c and b). Therefore, the F1 would be Cc Bb and cc bb. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo F1 parents are CcBb and ccbb.\n\nThen, the next step is to determine the F2 generation. To do that, I need to know the genotypes of the F1 parents. CcBb \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nEach F1 individual can produce four types of gametes based on Mendel's laws. So, for CcBb:\n\n- For the C locus (pattern): C (dominant) and c (recessive)\n- For the B locus (color): B (dominant) and b (recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for ccbb:\n\n- For the C locus: c (recessive)\n- For the B locus: b (recessive)\n\nSo the gametes from CcBb will be:\n\n- C/B: 25%\n- C/b: 25%\n- c/B: 25%\n- c/b: 25%\n\nAnd the gametes from ccbb will be:\n\n- c/b: 100% (since it's homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nSo the F2 generation will be a result of these gametes mixing.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, I need to consider the genotypes and the corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pattern (C/c):\n  - If at least one C, pattern is checkered (dominant).\n  - Otherwise, pattern is plain (recessive).\n\n- Color (B/b):\n  - If at least one B, color is red (dominant).\n  - Otherwise, color is brown (recessive).\n\nSo, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nBut before that, I should note the probabilities of each genotype in the F2 generation. Since F1 is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nParental gametes: 25% C/B, 25% C/b, 25% c/B, 25% c/b.\n\nParent 1 (CcBb) contributes C/B and c/b.\n\nParent 2 (ccbb) contributes c/b.\n\nSo the F2 for C locus:\n\n- C/B \u00d7 c/b: 25% C/B \u00d7 c/b = C c B b\n- C/B \u00d7 ccbb: 25% C/B \u00d7 ccbb = C c cc bb\n- c/B \u00d7 c/b: 25% c/B \u00d7 c/b = c c B b\n- c/B \u00d7 ccbb: 25% c/B \u00d7 ccbb = c c cc bb\n\nWait, but for the F2 generation, each F1 parent produces gametes, so the total number of gametes is 4 (from F1) \u00d7 1 (from ccbb) = 4 gametes for each parent. But since F1 is selfing, I think I need to calculate the F2 based on the F1 parents producing gametes.\n\nAlternatively, using Punnett squares. Let's create a Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nWait, no, F1 is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb. So F1 parents are CcBb and ccbb.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will come from the F1 parents' gametes.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nFrom CcBb, gametes are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b.\n\nFrom ccbb, gametes are c/b.\n\nSo the F2 C locus genotypes are:\n\n- C/B \u00d7 c/b = C c B b\n- C/b \u00d7 c/b = C c c b\n- c/B \u00d7 c/b = c c B b\n- c/b \u00d7 c/b = c c c b\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\nFrom CcBb, gametes: B and b.\n\nFrom ccbb, gametes: b.\n\nSo F2 B locus genotypes:\n\n- B \u00d7 b = B b\n- b \u00d7 b = b b\n\nPutting it together, F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CcBb: 25% (from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb)\n- Ccbb: 25% (from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb)\n- ccBb: 25% (from ccbb \u00d7 ccbb)\n- ccbb: 25% (from ccbb \u00d7 ccbb)\n\nWait, no, because the F1s are CcBb and ccbb. Each F1 produces four gametes, so the F2 will have 16 possible combinations. But considering dominance, some will combine into the same phenotype.\n\nLet me approach this systematically.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nPossible gametes:\n\n- C/B (25%)\n\n- C/b (25%)\n\n- c/B (25%)\n\n- c/b (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nPossible gametes:\n\n- B (25%)\n\n- b (75%)\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the B locus, the F1 is CcBb, so gametes are B and b. The other F1 is ccbb, so gametes are b. So the F2 for the B locus will be:\n\n- B (25%) from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb\n\n- b (25% \u00d7 25%) from CcBb \u00d7 ccbb\n\n- b (25%) from ccbb \u00d7 ccbb\n\nWait, no, I think I'm complicating this. Let's instead use the standard method for calculating F2 ratios.\n\nSince F1 is CcBb \u00d7 ccbb, the F2 will have the following probabilities for each locus:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nProbability of C (C/B): 25%, C (c/B): 25%, c (c/B): 25%, c (c/b): 25%.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the F1 is CcBb. When crossed with ccbb, the F2 will have:\n\nFor C locus:\n\nProbability of C (C/B) = 25% (from Cc) \u00d7 100% (ccbb) = 25%\n\nProbability of c (c/B) = 25% (from cc) \u00d7 100% (ccbb) = 25%\n\nSimilarly for B locus:\n\nIn F1, for the B locus, the gametes are B (25%) and b (75%). But since the other parent is ccbb, which only contributes b, the F2 B locus will be:\n\n- B (25% \u00d7 100%) = 25%\n\n- b (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb. So for the B locus, the gametes are B (25%) and b (75%).\n\nThe other parent is ccbb, so gametes are b (100%).\n\nThus, F2 B locus genotypes:\n\n- B \u00d7 b = Bb (25%)\n\n- b \u00d7 b = bb (75%)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Bb \u2192 B (dominant) \u2192 red\n\n- bb \u2192 b (recessive) \u2192 brown\n\nSimilarly, for the C locus:\n\nF1 is CcBb. Gametes: C (25%), c (75%).\n\nOther parent is ccbb, so gametes: c (100%).\n\nThus, F2 C locus genotypes:\n\n- C \u00d7 c = Cc (25%)\n\n- c \u00d7 c = cc (75%)\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Cc \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n\n- cc \u2192 c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nSo now, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C locus: 25% Cc, 75% cc\n\nFor B locus: 25% Bb, 75% bb\n\nNow, the F2 individuals will have combinations of these:\n\n- 25% (Cc) \u00d7 25% (Bb) = CcBb\n\n- 25% (Cc) \u00d7 75% (bb) = Ccbb\n\n- 75% (cc) \u00d7 25% (Bb) = ccBb\n\n- 75% (cc) \u00d7 75% (bb) = ccbb\n\nBut we need to group these into phenotypes.\n\nNow, let's map the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: C (checkered) and B (red) \u2192 checkered red\n\n- Ccbb: C (checkered) and b (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n\n- ccBb: c (plain) and B (red) \u2192 plain red\n\n- ccbb: c (plain) and b (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNext, calculate the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CcBb occurs 25% of the time.\n\n- Ccbb occurs 25% of the time.\n\n- ccBb occurs 75% of the time.\n\n- ccbb occurs 75% of the time.\n\nWait, no, because the F2 counts are as follows:\n\n- CcBb: 25% (from Cc \u00d7 Bb)\n\n- Ccbb: 25% (from Cc \u00d7 bb)\n\n- ccBb: 75% (from cc \u00d7 Bb)\n\n- ccbb: 75% (from cc \u00d7 bb)\n\nWait, but each of these will contribute to different phenotypes based on their genotype.\n\nSo:\n\n- CcBb: checkered red (phenotype count: 25%)\n\n- Ccbb: checkered brown (phenotype count: 25%)\n\n- ccBb: plain red (phenotype count: 75%)\n\n- ccbb: plain brown (phenotype count: 75%)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% : 25% : 75% : 75%. Simplifying, dividing each by 25%, we get 1:1:3:3.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Not matching our 1:1:3:3.\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red",

One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means both its genes are dominant, right? So their genotype would be CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown, meaning one dominant allele and one recessive in each gene. So their genotype would be cc bb.\n\nThey're asking for an A Punnett square showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. There are several options given (A to J), each with different phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let me break down the problem into steps because that might help me organize my thoughts better.\n\nStep 1: Determine the genotypes of the parents.\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible gametes each parent can produce.\nFor Parent 1 (CC BB), since both alleles are dominant, they can only produce gametes with both dominant alleles. So all gametes will be CB.\n\nFor Parent 2 (cc bb), since both alleles are recessive, they can only produce gametes with both recessive alleles. So all gametes will be cb.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait. Wait, hold on. No, wait. If Parent 2 is cc bb, then the c and b alleles are separate. But since they're homozygous, the gametes would have either c or b. However, in this case, they're stated as plain brown, which implies both traits are present but recessive. So actually, Parent 2 has genotype cc bb, meaning each trait is recessive. Therefore, their gametes would be either cb or something else?\n\nWait, no\u2014the notation seems off. Because if it's cc bb, that's both recessive for both genes. So each gamete would carry either one of the alleles, so gametes would be either c and b combined. So for Parent 2, the only possibility is cb.\n\nSo both parents can only produce gametes of CB and cb respectively.\n\nBut wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so their gametes must be CB because both are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, so their gametes must be cb because both are recessive.\n\nNow, when these gametes combine, the F1 generation would consist of Parent 1's gamete (CB) combining with Parent 2's gamete (cb), resulting in CcBb. Since there are two parents contributing, the F1 should have all combinations of the parents' gametes.\n\nWait, no\u2014if Parent 1 produces CB and Parent 2 produces cb, then the F1 would get CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, making CcBb. But since both parents contribute once, the F1 would all be CcBb.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no\u2014no, no, wait. Actually, in a dihybrid cross where both parents are homozygous, the F1 would all be heterozygotes, but here Parent 2 is also homozygous. Wait, but Parent 2 is cc bb, so their gametes are all cb, not cb or cc or anything else. Similarly, Parent 1's gametes are all CB.\n\nTherefore, all F1 offspring would be CcBb.\n\nThen, the F1 individuals (all CcBb) would self-fertilize to produce the F2 generation. So we need to set up a Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. Gene 1: C (dominant) or c (recessive). Gene 2: B (dominant) or b (recessive).\n\nSo the F1 is CcBb. Each gamete from F1 is a combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square:\n\n- First, list all possible gametes from F1:\n  - C/B\n  - C/b\n  - c/B\n  - c/b\n\nWait, but actually, each gamete combines one allele from each gene. So for Gene 1, F1 is Cc, so gametes are C (50%) and c (50%). For Gene 2, F1 is Bb, so gametes are B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSo the F1 gametes are a combination of these, leading to four possibilities: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nEach of these four gametes occurs at equal frequency (25% each) in the F1 population.\n\nWhen F1 (CCBB?) Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so their gametes are all CB. Parent 2 is cc bb, so their gametes are all cb. So F1 is all CcBb.\n\nSo in the F2 generation, each F1 individual (CcBb) will produce gametes that are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b, each at 25%.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) self-mates, the F2 will have the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\nGene 1: Cc x Cc \u2192 possible gametes: C and c (25% each)\nGene 2: Bb x Bb \u2192 possible gametes: B and b (25% each)\n\nSo the F2 will have 4x4=16 possible combinations, but considering dominance, some genotypes will result in specific phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant allele C \u2192 Checkered color\n- Dominant allele B \u2192 Red color\n- Recessive alleles \u2192 plain color\n\nSo for each gene:\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Checkered (checkered)\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain (plain)\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Brown\n\nThus, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each possible genotype:\n\n1. Cc x Bb \u2192 Phenotype?\n   - C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n   - C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n   - c and B \u2192 Plain Red\n   - c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's count how many of each genotype there are in the F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 will have the following distribution:\n\n- 25% Cc x Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 25% Cc x bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc x Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- 25% cc x bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nBut wait, this isn't quite accurate because when you consider independent assortment, the actual counts depend on the number of each type of gamete.\n\nWait, more accurately, in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a monohybrid cross. For a dihybrid cross, it's different.\n\nActually, for two traits, the dihybrid cross results in 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Yes, in a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation shows 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the exact numbers.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are pure and homozygous (e.g., AA aa), the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut in our case, the parents are both homozygous, so perhaps it's similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's simpler to calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that F1 is CcBb, which is all the same, so when F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% Cc x Bb \u2192 Checkered Red (C and B dominant)\n- 25% Cc x bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n- 25% cc x Bb \u2192 Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- 25% cc x bb \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not exactly that because each parent contributes one allele per gene. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- All Cc x Bb (Checkered Red): 25%\n- Cc x bb (Checkered Brown): 25%\n- cc x Bb (Plain Red): 25%\n- cc x bb (Plain Brown): 25%\n\nBut when adding them up, each phenotype accounts for 25%, so the total would be 100%. However, when considering dominance, the number of each phenotype would be different.\n\nWait, no\u2014each combination is equally likely, so each phenotype would have 25% frequency.\n\nBut let's verify by counting the possible genotypes.\n\nTotal F2 = 16 (since 4x4 grid)\n\nGenotypes:\n\n1. Cc x Bb \u2192 25% of 16 = 4\n2. Cc x bb \u2192 4\n3. cc x Bb \u2192 4\n4. cc x bb \u2192 4\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain Red\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes appears 4 times, so the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. That can\u2019t be right because the standard dihybrid cross shows 9:3:3:1. Hmm, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that all four combinations occur equally. In reality, when considering independent assortment, the proportion of each phenotype is not necessarily equal.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Instead of assuming all gametes are 25%, perhaps I should use the Punnett square correctly.\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes as follows:\n\n- C/B (25%)\n- C/b (25%)\n- c/B (25%)\n- c/b (25%)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFor Gene 1 (C/c):\n- C/C (25%), C/c (50%), c/c (25%)\n\nFor Gene 2 (B/b):\n- B/B (25%), B/b (50%), b/b (25%)\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the overall probabilities multiply:\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are combinations of these probabilities.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each allele is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo the phenotypes for each genotype are:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain Red\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's find how often each phenotype occurs.\n\nEach gene has a 25% chance of each allele, so for each gene:\n\nGene 1:\n- C (dominant) \u2192 75% (since 25% + 50%)\n- c (recessive) \u2192 25%\n\nGene 2:\n- B (dominant) \u2192 75% (25% + 50%)\n- b (recessive) \u2192 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Checkered Red (C and B dominant) \u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Checkered Brown (C dominant, b recessive) \u2192 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain Brown (c recessive, b recessive) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these percentages: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nSimplifying by multiplying each by 16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n(56.25*16) : (18.75*16) : (18.75*16) : (6.25*16) \u2192 900 : 300 : 300 : 100\n\nDividing each by 100: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, favoring Checkered Red (9), followed by Checkered Brown (3), Plain Red (3), and Plain Brown (1).\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nThat doesn't match. Option D says: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 that matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, no, option D is: 1 (checkered red), 3 (checkered brown), 9 (plain red), 3 (plain brown). That adds up to 16, which fits 9+3+3+1=16. So option D is correct.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, so the phenotypic ratio is 9 parts Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown. So checking the options, option D states this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nYes, option C is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with my calculation.

Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about a dihybrid cross between two birds. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means both its genes are dominant, right? So their genotype would be CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown, meaning one dominant allele and one recessive in each gene. So their genotype would be cc bb.\n\nThey're asking for an A Punnett square showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. There are several options given (A to J), each with different phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let me break down the problem into steps because that might help me organize my thoughts better.\n\nStep 1: Determine the genotypes of the parents.\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible gametes each parent can produce.\nFor Parent 1 (CC BB), since both alleles are dominant, they can only produce gametes with both dominant alleles. So all gametes will be CB.\n\nFor Parent 2 (cc bb), since both alleles are recessive, they can only produce gametes with both recessive alleles. So all gametes will be cb.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait. Wait, hold on. No, wait. If Parent 2 is cc bb, then the c and b alleles are separate. But since they're homozygous, the gametes would have either c or b. However, in this case, they're stated as plain brown, which implies both traits are present but recessive. So actually, Parent 2 has genotype cc bb, meaning each trait is recessive. Therefore, their gametes would be either cb or something else?\n\nWait, no\u2014the notation seems off. Because if it's cc bb, that's both recessive for both genes. So each gamete would carry either one of the alleles, so gametes would be either c and b combined. So for Parent 2, the only possibility is cb.\n\nSo both parents can only produce gametes of CB and cb respectively.\n\nBut wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so their gametes must be CB because both are dominant. Parent 2 is cc bb, so their gametes must be cb because both are recessive.\n\nNow, when these gametes combine, the F1 generation would consist of Parent 1's gamete (CB) combining with Parent 2's gamete (cb), resulting in CcBb. Since there are two parents contributing, the F1 should have all combinations of the parents' gametes.\n\nWait, no\u2014if Parent 1 produces CB and Parent 2 produces cb, then the F1 would get CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, making CcBb. But since both parents contribute once, the F1 would all be CcBb.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no\u2014no, no, wait. Actually, in a dihybrid cross where both parents are homozygous, the F1 would all be heterozygotes, but here Parent 2 is also homozygous. Wait, but Parent 2 is cc bb, so their gametes are all cb, not cb or cc or anything else. Similarly, Parent 1's gametes are all CB.\n\nTherefore, all F1 offspring would be CcBb.\n\nThen, the F1 individuals (all CcBb) would self-fertilize to produce the F2 generation. So we need to set up a Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. Gene 1: C (dominant) or c (recessive). Gene 2: B (dominant) or b (recessive).\n\nSo the F1 is CcBb. Each gamete from F1 is a combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square:\n\n- First, list all possible gametes from F1:\n  - C/B\n  - C/b\n  - c/B\n  - c/b\n\nWait, but actually, each gamete combines one allele from each gene. So for Gene 1, F1 is Cc, so gametes are C (50%) and c (50%). For Gene 2, F1 is Bb, so gametes are B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSo the F1 gametes are a combination of these, leading to four possibilities: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nEach of these four gametes occurs at equal frequency (25% each) in the F1 population.\n\nWhen F1 (CCBB?) Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so their gametes are all CB. Parent 2 is cc bb, so their gametes are all cb. So F1 is all CcBb.\n\nSo in the F2 generation, each F1 individual (CcBb) will produce gametes that are C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b, each at 25%.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) self-mates, the F2 will have the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\nGene 1: Cc x Cc \u2192 possible gametes: C and c (25% each)\nGene 2: Bb x Bb \u2192 possible gametes: B and b (25% each)\n\nSo the F2 will have 4x4=16 possible combinations, but considering dominance, some genotypes will result in specific phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant allele C \u2192 Checkered color\n- Dominant allele B \u2192 Red color\n- Recessive alleles \u2192 plain color\n\nSo for each gene:\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Checkered (checkered)\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain (plain)\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Brown\n\nThus, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each possible genotype:\n\n1. Cc x Bb \u2192 Phenotype?\n   - C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n   - C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n   - c and B \u2192 Plain Red\n   - c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's count how many of each genotype there are in the F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 will have the following distribution:\n\n- 25% Cc x Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 25% Cc x bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc x Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- 25% cc x bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nBut wait, this isn't quite accurate because when you consider independent assortment, the actual counts depend on the number of each type of gamete.\n\nWait, more accurately, in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s for a monohybrid cross. For a dihybrid cross, it's different.\n\nActually, for two traits, the dihybrid cross results in 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Yes, in a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation shows 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the exact numbers.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are pure and homozygous (e.g., AA aa), the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut in our case, the parents are both homozygous, so perhaps it's similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's simpler to calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that F1 is CcBb, which is all the same, so when F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% Cc x Bb \u2192 Checkered Red (C and B dominant)\n- 25% Cc x bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n- 25% cc x Bb \u2192 Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- 25% cc x bb \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not exactly that because each parent contributes one allele per gene. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- All Cc x Bb (Checkered Red): 25%\n- Cc x bb (Checkered Brown): 25%\n- cc x Bb (Plain Red): 25%\n- cc x bb (Plain Brown): 25%\n\nBut when adding them up, each phenotype accounts for 25%, so the total would be 100%. However, when considering dominance, the number of each phenotype would be different.\n\nWait, no\u2014each combination is equally likely, so each phenotype would have 25% frequency.\n\nBut let's verify by counting the possible genotypes.\n\nTotal F2 = 16 (since 4x4 grid)\n\nGenotypes:\n\n1. Cc x Bb \u2192 25% of 16 = 4\n2. Cc x bb \u2192 4\n3. cc x Bb \u2192 4\n4. cc x bb \u2192 4\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain Red\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nEach of these four phenotypes appears 4 times, so the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. That can\u2019t be right because the standard dihybrid cross shows 9:3:3:1. Hmm, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that all four combinations occur equally. In reality, when considering independent assortment, the proportion of each phenotype is not necessarily equal.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Instead of assuming all gametes are 25%, perhaps I should use the Punnett square correctly.\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes as follows:\n\n- C/B (25%)\n- C/b (25%)\n- c/B (25%)\n- c/b (25%)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFor Gene 1 (C/c):\n- C/C (25%), C/c (50%), c/c (25%)\n\nFor Gene 2 (B/b):\n- B/B (25%), B/b (50%), b/b (25%)\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the overall probabilities multiply:\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are combinations of these probabilities.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each allele is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo the phenotypes for each genotype are:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain Red\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's find how often each phenotype occurs.\n\nEach gene has a 25% chance of each allele, so for each gene:\n\nGene 1:\n- C (dominant) \u2192 75% (since 25% + 50%)\n- c (recessive) \u2192 25%\n\nGene 2:\n- B (dominant) \u2192 75% (25% + 50%)\n- b (recessive) \u2192 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Checkered Red (C and B dominant) \u2192 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Checkered Brown (C dominant, b recessive) \u2192 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain Red (c recessive, B dominant) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain Brown (c recessive, b recessive) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these percentages: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nSimplifying by multiplying each by 16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n(56.25*16) : (18.75*16) : (18.75*16) : (6.25*16) \u2192 900 : 300 : 300 : 100\n\nDividing each by 100: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, favoring Checkered Red (9), followed by Checkered Brown (3), Plain Red (3), and Plain Brown (1).\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nThat doesn't match. Option D says: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 that matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, no, option D is: 1 (checkered red), 3 (checkered brown), 9 (plain red), 3 (plain brown). That adds up to 16, which fits 9+3+3+1=16. So option D is correct.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, so the phenotypic ratio is 9 parts Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown. So checking the options, option D states this exactly.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nYes, option C is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with my calculation. So the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_resampled": "Let's see what it's about.",
    "rollout": " Let's see what it's about. There are these birds with different colored pigeons, and they're controlled by certain genes. The question involves an adihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and another that's plain brown. I need to create a Punnett square for their offspring, specifically looking at the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n- Red color is from a dominant gene B.\n- Brown color comes from the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for both genes, right? Because in genetics, when you have a diploid organism like a bird, you have two copies of each gene. So, the possible combinations would be BB, Bb, or bb for each gene.\n\nNow, the parent birds involved in the cross are:\n\n1. Checkered red bird: Since checkered is C, and red is B, I think this bird must be heterozygous for both traits because being checkered usually means having two dominant traits expressed. Wait, no\u2014checkered might mean the combination of both traits is present. But actually, since C is dominant and c is recessive, perhaps the checkered bird is Cc for both genes. Similarly, red is Bb because if B is dominant over b, then having at least one B allele gives red color. But wait, the initial description says \"checkered\" as the dominant trait, so maybe the bird is Cc for both B and b, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the bird is CC for both genes. Wait, the user provided the parents as CCBB and ccbb. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe first parent is CCBB. Breaking that down into two genes: the bird has a genotype of CC for the first gene (since C is dominant) and BB for the second gene (since B is dominant). Wait, but the user wrote it as CCBB, which suggests four letters, but in reality, each bird has two alleles per gene. So CCBB would mean CC for the B locus and BB for the other locus. But wait, that can't be right because the checkered pattern is described as being due to gene C, and color is due to gene B. Maybe the bird is CC for both B and b? Or perhaps CCBB represents the two genes as CC and BB. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for the first gene (let's say locus A), the parents are CC (from CCBB) and cc (from ccbb). That makes sense because CC is the dominant form for locus A, showing checkered, and cc shows plain. For the second gene (locus B), both parents are BB (CCBB) and bb (ccbb). So, the first parent is heterozygous for both genes, while the second parent is homozygous recessive.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. The parents are CCBB and ccbb. That would imply that for gene A (assuming first part), the parents are CC and cc, making sense. For gene B, the parents are BB and bb. So, each bird has two alleles for each gene.\n\nNow, the cross is between CCBB (heterozygous for both genes) and ccbb (homozygous recessive).\n\nTo find the F1 generation, we cross CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. Each parent will produce gametes based on Mendel's laws.\n\nFor gene A:\n- Parent 1 (CCBB) will produce gametes with C (50%).\n- Parent 2 (ccbb) will produce gametes with c (100%).\n\nSo, all F1 for gene A will be Cc (50% C, 50% c).\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1 (BB) will produce gametes with B (100%).\n- Parent 2 (bb) will produce gametes with b (100%).\n\nSo, all F1 for gene B will be Bb (100% B, 0% b).\n\nTherefore, F1 will be CcBb (each gene is independently inherited).\n\nWait, but the user provided F1 as CcBb, but in the gamete section, there are multiple gametes listed. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the F1 section, the gametes are (CB), (cb), and also (Cb) and (cc). Wait, that seems off. Normally, for F1, you'd get 50% C and c for gene A, and 50% B and b for gene B. So, the correct gametes should be CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25%. But the user lists them as (CB), (cb), and also (Cb) and (cc). That doesn't seem right. It looks like they're considering only one allele for each gene in some cases, which is incorrect. But since the question asks about F2, maybe I don't need to worry too much about the F1.\n\nBut regardless, moving forward, the F1 will have all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent. So, for gene A, 50% C and 50% c, and for gene B, 50% B and 50% b.\n\nThus, F1 genotypes will be CcBb (as each parent contributes one allele for each gene). Wait, but the user wrote F1 as CcBb, but in the gamete section, it's listed as (CB) (cb), etc., which probably refers to the F1's gametes. Anyway, perhaps I should move on.\n\nNow, the question is about an adihybrid cross, but actually, the cross is between CCBB and ccbb. Adihybrid crosses involve two traits, typically. In this case, the two traits are gene A and gene B.\n\nSince the parents are CCBB and ccbb, each parent is heterozygous for both traits. Therefore, their F2 generation will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents: CCBB (heterozygous for both genes) and ccbb (homozygous recessive for both genes).\n\n2. Create a Punnett square for the F1 generation, but since we're interested in F2, we'll consider the cross of F1 with F1.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the question specifies an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). So, the cross is CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. This is not an F1-F2 cross but rather a selfing of the homozygous parent plus an F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation resulting from crossing a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) with a plain brown bird (ccbb), meaning the F2 would result from the cross of F1 (which is CcBb) with itself.\n\nBut the user wrote the cross as CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which may be confusing because CCBB isn't a standard notation. Usually, it's written as CC \u00d7 cc, representing a heterozygote crossed with a homozygote recessive. But here, it's CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is between CC (for gene A) and cc (for gene A) for the first gene, and BB (for gene B) and bb (for gene B) for the second gene. So, it's a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both genes.\n\nIn that case, the F1 will be CcBb, as each gene is independently inherited. Then, the F2 will result from F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nBut the user mentions an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, so perhaps the cross is between CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). That would mean that the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be the results of crossing CcBb with itself.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed.\n\nEach parent is CcBb. When crossed with themselves, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nRed color is dominant (B), and brown is recessive (b). Checkered is dominant (C), and plain is recessive (c).\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for each trait are:\n\nGene A (C or c):\n- Dominant: C (red)\n- Recessive: c (plain)\n\nGene B (B or b):\n- Dominant: B (red)\n- Recessive: b (brown)\n\nCombining both genes:\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- c c bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- c c bb \u2192 Wait, no. Let me list all possibilities properly.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for Gene A and two for Gene B.\n\nFor Gene A:\n- CC \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered (since dominant C expresses)\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\n- BB \u2192 Red\n- Bb \u2192 Red\n- bb \u2192 Brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotype combines both traits:\n\n- Checkered Red: CCBB \u2192 both dominant\n- Checkered Brown: CcBB \u2192 dominant C and dominant B\n- Plain Red: ccBB \u2192 recessive c and dominant B\n- Checkered Brown: CcBb \u2192 dominant C and dominant B\n- Checkered Red: ccBb \u2192 recessive c and dominant B\n- Checkered Brown: CcBB \u2192 Wait, no, that's already covered.\nWait, maybe better to use a grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CcBB:\n   - Gene A: C (Checkered)\n   - Gene B: B (Red)\n   \u2192 Checkered Red\n\n2. CcBb:\n   - Gene A: C (Checkered)\n   - Gene B: B (Red)\n   \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n3. c c bb:\n   - Gene A: c (Plain)\n   - Gene B: b (Brown)\n   \u2192 Plain Brown\n\n4. c c BB:\n   - Gene A: c (Plain)\n   - Gene B: B (Red)\n   \u2192 Plain Red\n\n5. c c Bb:\n   - Gene A: c (Plain)\n   - Gene B: B (Red)\n   \u2192 Plain Red\n\n6. c c bb:\n   - Both recessive\n   \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but in reality, the bird's phenotype depends on whether any dominant allele is present. If either dominant allele is present, the bird shows the respective color. So, for each trait, the presence of the dominant allele determines the color.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nNow, applying this:\n\n- Any dominant C or dominant B means the bird is red or brown respectively.\n- Any recessive c or b means the bird is plain or red/brown respectively.\n\nSo, combining both traits, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. c c bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c c BB \u2192 Plain Red\n5. c c Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. c c bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but that leads to three phenotypes: Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, and Plain. But according to the options, we need to calculate the ratios correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, its phenotype is determined by the dominant trait. If it has both recessive alleles, it's determined by the recessive trait.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the dominance works independently for each gene. So, the presence of any dominant allele for a gene determines the phenotype for that gene. Therefore, the overall phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If Gene A is dominant (C), and Gene B is dominant (B): Checkered Red\n- If Gene A is dominant (C), and Gene B is recessive (b): Checkered Brown\n- If Gene A is recessive (c), and Gene B is dominant (B): Plain Red\n- If Gene A is recessive (c), and Gene B is recessive (b): Plain Brown\n\nSo, four possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each:\n\nLooking at the F2 generation, which is a dihybrid cross (Cc x Cc), leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but since we're dealing with two genes, the actual F2 will have 9+3+3+1 = 16 phenotypes, but grouped by their phenotypic expression.\n\nHowever, the user's answer choices are giving specific ratios, such as 6,2,2,2 for checkered red, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that each bird is represented by two letters (e.g., CcBb), and their phenotype is determined by whether dominant alleles are present in either gene.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal number of birds = 16.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C dominant and B dominant): 9 birds (CCBB, CcBB, CC Bb, etc.)\n2. Checkered Brown (C dominant and B recessive): 3 birds (CcBB, Cc Bb)\n3. Plain Red (c dominant and B recessive): 3 birds (ccBB, cc Bb)\n4. Plain Brown (c dominant and B dominant): 1 bird (ccBB)\n\nWait, but that adds up to 16, but the user's options don't match this exactly. However, in the options, option D is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Which matches my calculation except for the order.\n\nWait, but in reality, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered Brown (C and B recessive)\n3. Plain Red (c and B recessive)\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's see what it's about. There are these birds with different colored pigeons, and they're controlled by certain genes. The question involves an adihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and another that's plain brown. I need to create a Punnett square for their offspring, specifically looking at the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n- Red color is from a dominant gene B.\n- Brown color comes from the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for both genes, right? Because in genetics, when you have a diploid organism like a bird, you have two copies of each gene. So, the possible combinations would be BB, Bb, or bb for each gene.\n\nNow, the parent birds involved in the cross are:\n\n1. Checkered red bird: Since checkered is C, and red is B, I think this bird must be heterozygous for both traits because being checkered usually means having two dominant traits expressed. Wait, no\u2014checkered might mean the combination of both traits is present. But actually, since C is dominant and c is recessive, perhaps the checkered bird is Cc for both genes. Similarly, red is Bb because if B is dominant over b, then having at least one B allele gives red color. But wait, the initial description says \"checkered\" as the dominant trait, so maybe the bird is Cc for both B and b, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the bird is CC for both genes. Wait, the user provided the parents as CCBB and ccbb. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe first parent is CCBB. Breaking that down into two genes: the bird has a genotype of CC for the first gene (since C is dominant) and BB for the second gene (since B is dominant). Wait, but the user wrote it as CCBB, which suggests four letters, but in reality, each bird has two alleles per gene. So CCBB would mean CC for the B locus and BB for the other locus. But wait, that can't be right because the checkered pattern is described as being due to gene C, and color is due to gene B. Maybe the bird is CC for both B and b? Or perhaps CCBB represents the two genes as CC and BB. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for the first gene (let's say locus A), the parents are CC (from CCBB) and cc (from ccbb). That makes sense because CC is the dominant form for locus A, showing checkered, and cc shows plain. For the second gene (locus B), both parents are BB (CCBB) and bb (ccbb). So, the first parent is heterozygous for both genes, while the second parent is homozygous recessive.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. The parents are CCBB and ccbb. That would imply that for gene A (assuming first part), the parents are CC and cc, making sense. For gene B, the parents are BB and bb. So, each bird has two alleles for each gene.\n\nNow, the cross is between CCBB (heterozygous for both genes) and ccbb (homozygous recessive).\n\nTo find the F1 generation, we cross CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. Each parent will produce gametes based on Mendel's laws.\n\nFor gene A:\n- Parent 1 (CCBB) will produce gametes with C (50%).\n- Parent 2 (ccbb) will produce gametes with c (100%).\n\nSo, all F1 for gene A will be Cc (50% C, 50% c).\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1 (BB) will produce gametes with B (100%).\n- Parent 2 (bb) will produce gametes with b (100%).\n\nSo, all F1 for gene B will be Bb (100% B, 0% b).\n\nTherefore, F1 will be CcBb (each gene is independently inherited).\n\nWait, but the user provided F1 as CcBb, but in the gamete section, there are multiple gametes listed. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the F1 section, the gametes are (CB), (cb), and also (Cb) and (cc). Wait, that seems off. Normally, for F1, you'd get 50% C and c for gene A, and 50% B and b for gene B. So, the correct gametes should be CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25%. But the user lists them as (CB), (cb), and also (Cb) and (cc). That doesn't seem right. It looks like they're considering only one allele for each gene in some cases, which is incorrect. But since the question asks about F2, maybe I don't need to worry too much about the F1.\n\nBut regardless, moving forward, the F1 will have all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent. So, for gene A, 50% C and 50% c, and for gene B, 50% B and 50% b.\n\nThus, F1 genotypes will be CcBb (as each parent contributes one allele for each gene). Wait, but the user wrote F1 as CcBb, but in the gamete section, it's listed as (CB) (cb), etc., which probably refers to the F1's gametes. Anyway, perhaps I should move on.\n\nNow, the question is about an adihybrid cross, but actually, the cross is between CCBB and ccbb. Adihybrid crosses involve two traits, typically. In this case, the two traits are gene A and gene B.\n\nSince the parents are CCBB and ccbb, each parent is heterozygous for both traits. Therefore, their F2 generation will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents: CCBB (heterozygous for both genes) and ccbb (homozygous recessive for both genes).\n\n2. Create a Punnett square for the F1 generation, but since we're interested in F2, we'll consider the cross of F1 with F1.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the question specifies an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). So, the cross is CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. This is not an F1-F2 cross but rather a selfing of the homozygous parent plus an F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation resulting from crossing a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) with a plain brown bird (ccbb), meaning the F2 would result from the cross of F1 (which is CcBb) with itself.\n\nBut the user wrote the cross as CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which may be confusing because CCBB isn't a standard notation. Usually, it's written as CC \u00d7 cc, representing a heterozygote crossed with a homozygote recessive. But here, it's CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is between CC (for gene A) and cc (for gene A) for the first gene, and BB (for gene B) and bb (for gene B) for the second gene. So, it's a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both genes.\n\nIn that case, the F1 will be CcBb, as each gene is independently inherited. Then, the F2 will result from F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nBut the user mentions an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird, so perhaps the cross is between CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). That would mean that the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be the results of crossing CcBb with itself.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed.\n\nEach parent is CcBb. When crossed with themselves, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nRed color is dominant (B), and brown is recessive (b). Checkered is dominant (C), and plain is recessive (c).\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for each trait are:\n\nGene A (C or c):\n- Dominant: C (red)\n- Recessive: c (plain)\n\nGene B (B or b):\n- Dominant: B (red)\n- Recessive: b (brown)\n\nCombining both genes:\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- c c bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- c c bb \u2192 Wait, no. Let me list all possibilities properly.\n\nWait, more accurately:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for Gene A and two for Gene B.\n\nFor Gene A:\n- CC \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered (since dominant C expresses)\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\n- BB \u2192 Red\n- Bb \u2192 Red\n- bb \u2192 Brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotype combines both traits:\n\n- Checkered Red: CCBB \u2192 both dominant\n- Checkered Brown: CcBB \u2192 dominant C and dominant B\n- Plain Red: ccBB \u2192 recessive c and dominant B\n- Checkered Brown: CcBb \u2192 dominant C and dominant B\n- Checkered Red: ccBb \u2192 recessive c and dominant B\n- Checkered Brown: CcBB \u2192 Wait, no, that's already covered.\nWait, maybe better to use a grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CcBB:\n   - Gene A: C (Checkered)\n   - Gene B: B (Red)\n   \u2192 Checkered Red\n\n2. CcBb:\n   - Gene A: C (Checkered)\n   - Gene B: B (Red)\n   \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n3. c c bb:\n   - Gene A: c (Plain)\n   - Gene B: b (Brown)\n   \u2192 Plain Brown\n\n4. c c BB:\n   - Gene A: c (Plain)\n   - Gene B: B (Red)\n   \u2192 Plain Red\n\n5. c c Bb:\n   - Gene A: c (Plain)\n   - Gene B: B (Red)\n   \u2192 Plain Red\n\n6. c c bb:\n   - Both recessive\n   \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but in reality, the bird's phenotype depends on whether any dominant allele is present. If either dominant allele is present, the bird shows the respective color. So, for each trait, the presence of the dominant allele determines the color.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nNow, applying this:\n\n- Any dominant C or dominant B means the bird is red or brown respectively.\n- Any recessive c or b means the bird is plain or red/brown respectively.\n\nSo, combining both traits, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. c c bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c c BB \u2192 Plain Red\n5. c c Bb \u2192 Plain Red\n6. c c bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but that leads to three phenotypes: Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, and Plain. But according to the options, we need to calculate the ratios correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, its phenotype is determined by the dominant trait. If it has both recessive alleles, it's determined by the recessive trait.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the dominance works independently for each gene. So, the presence of any dominant allele for a gene determines the phenotype for that gene. Therefore, the overall phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If Gene A is dominant (C), and Gene B is dominant (B): Checkered Red\n- If Gene A is dominant (C), and Gene B is recessive (b): Checkered Brown\n- If Gene A is recessive (c), and Gene B is dominant (B): Plain Red\n- If Gene A is recessive (c), and Gene B is recessive (b): Plain Brown\n\nSo, four possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each:\n\nLooking at the F2 generation, which is a dihybrid cross (Cc x Cc), leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but since we're dealing with two genes, the actual F2 will have 9+3+3+1 = 16 phenotypes, but grouped by their phenotypic expression.\n\nHowever, the user's answer choices are giving specific ratios, such as 6,2,2,2 for checkered red, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that each bird is represented by two letters (e.g., CcBb), and their phenotype is determined by whether dominant alleles are present in either gene.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal number of birds = 16.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C dominant and B dominant): 9 birds (CCBB, CcBB, CC Bb, etc.)\n2. Checkered Brown (C dominant and B recessive): 3 birds (CcBB, Cc Bb)\n3. Plain Red (c dominant and B recessive): 3 birds (ccBB, cc Bb)\n4. Plain Brown (c dominant and B dominant): 1 bird (ccBB)\n\nWait, but that adds up to 16, but the user's options don't match this exactly. However, in the options, option D is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Which matches my calculation except for the order.\n\nWait, but in reality, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered Brown (C and B recessive)\n3. Plain Red (c and B recessive)\n4. Plain Brown (c and B dominant)\n\nWhich corresponds to the ratios 9:3:3:1, but depending on how the phenotypes are counted.\n\nBut the user's options are presenting the ratios as:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 which would correspond to checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (9), plain brown (3).\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but hold on. The user's options include option G as 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, which doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,2,6, summing to 16, which fits. But the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, matching option D.\n\nWait, but in reality, the standard dihybrid cross gives 9:3:3:1, but when considering the phenotypes based on dominant alleles, the counts are 9 (Checkered Red), 3 (Checkered Brown), 3 (Plain Red), 1 (Plain Brown), totaling 16. So, the ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut none of the options directly present this unless reordered. Looking back:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 16 total?\n\nWait, 6+6+2+2=16, yes.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this is option G.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Option D.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 E.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 F.\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 G.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 H.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 I.\n\nJ. 2,6,2,6 \u2192 J.\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 K.\n\nL. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 L.\n\nM. 2,2,2,2 \u2192 M.\n\nN. 3,3,3,3 \u2192 N.\n\nO. 6,2,2,6 \u2192 O.\n\nP. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nQ. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 same as G.\n\nR. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 same as H.\n\nS. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I.\n\nT. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E.\n\nU. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as P.\n\nV. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 same as J.\n\nW. 2,6,2,6 \u2192 same as K.\n\nX. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as P.\n\nY. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 same as J.\n\nZ. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I.\n\nSo, option G is 12,2,2,2, which doesn't add up to 16.

    "rollout": " It involves dihybrid crosses because there are two genes involved\u2014gene C and gene B. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nThe birds have a checkered pattern controlled by gene C, which is dominant. So if someone has at least one C allele, they'll be checkered. The other allele is recessive (c), making them plain. Then, color is determined by another gene, B. If someone has a B allele, their feathers or eyes will be red. The other allele (b) makes them brown.\n\nNow, we're dealing with an adihybrid cross between two birds: one that's homozygously checkered red (so genotype CC BB) and another that's plain brown (cc bb). Wait, no\u2014the second bird is described as plain brown, but since it's homozygous, its genotype should be cc bb. But wait, let me make sure about the notation. Usually, uppercase letters denote dominant traits, and lowercase recessive. So CC would mean both alleles are dominant, so checkered. BB means both are B, making them red. Similarly, cc would make them plain, and bb would make them brown.\n\nSo the parent birds are CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown).\n\nWhen we cross these two, we get the F1 generation. Since one is homozygous and the other is homozygous recessive, all the offspring in F1 will inherit one allele from each parent. From CC BB, they can give either C or B. From cc bb, they can give either c or b. So the possible gametes are CcBb, which combines into CcBb for all offspring in F1. So the F1 generation is all CcBb.\n\nWait, but the user provided a Punnett square earlier, so maybe I don't need to go through that again. Okay, moving on.\n\nWe're supposed to look at the F2 generation. The cross mentioned is between two F1 individuals. Each F1 bird is CcBb, so when you cross them, you'll get an F2 generation where each gene behaves independently. So for each gene, the parents contribute either a dominant or recessive allele.\n\nLet me break down the genes separately first. Gene C: Parent is Cc. So in gametes, 50% C and 50% c. Gene B: Parent is Bb. So gametes are 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of C/B and c/b.\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC : 25%\n- Cc : 50%\n- cc : 25%\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB : 25%\n- Bb : 50%\n- bb : 25%\n\nBut since the F2 is from a cross of two CcBb parents, we need to combine these probabilities correctly. However, perhaps it's easier to think of it as each parent contributing Cc and Bb, leading to four possibilities:\n\nCC x BB \u2192 CcBb,\nCC x Bb \u2192 CcBb,\nCc x BB \u2192 CcBb,\nCc x Bb \u2192 CcBb,\n\nSo all F2 individuals are CcBb, meaning they have one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, but the initial description says to consider the phenotypes based on dominance and recessiveness. So for each gene, the presence of dominant alleles leads to a certain phenotype.\n\nSo for gene C: Checkered (at least one C) vs plain (only c).\nGene B: Red (at least one B) vs brown (only b).\n\nSo combining both, the F2 will have different combinations of these traits.\n\nIn F2, each bird will have:\n\n- Checkered if either C or c present.\n- Red if either B or b present.\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\nCheckered Red (both dominant),\nCheckered Brown (only C, B present),\nPlain Red (only c, B present),\nPlain Brown (only c, b present).\n\nWait, no, actually, the checkered phenotype depends on having at least one C allele regardless of B. So even if B is present, as long as C is present, it's checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, if B is absent but C is present, it's checkered brown. If neither is present, then it's plain.\n\nWait, no, the wording was: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So B is dominant, so any B allele makes it red, and without B, it's brown. Similarly, for C, c is recessive, so any c makes it plain, else checkered.\n\nTherefore, F2 would have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red: At least one C and at least one B.\n2. Checkered Brown: At least one C, no B (i.e., B is recessive).\n3. Plain Red: No C, at least one B.\n4. Plain Brown: No C, no B.\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype do we expect?\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Since the parents are CcBb x CcBb, each gene follows a Mendelian distribution.\n\nFor gene C: Probability of CC = 25%, Cc = 50%, cc = 25%.\n\nFor gene B: Probability of BB = 25%, Bb = 50%, bb = 25%.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nEach combination of C and B determines the phenotype.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): Both C and B present. Probability: (50% C)(50% B) = 25%. But wait, actually, since both genes are independent, the probability is (prob of C being present) * (prob of B being present). Because CR requires at least one C and at least one B. So the probability is (1 - cc) * (1 - bb) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%.\n\nWait, no. Actually, CR occurs when at least one C and at least one B are present. The probability is calculated as:\n\n(Probability of C being present) * (Probability of B being present) + ... Hmm, perhaps a better way is to subtract the non-C or non-B cases.\n\nAlternatively, the number of possible outcomes is 4^2 = 16 (since each gene has three possibilities, but considering dominant and recessive). But perhaps using probabilities directly is clearer.\n\nWait, no. For the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance of each possible genotype. But the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nActually, a more accurate approach is to list all possible combinations and their phenotypes.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities, so combined, there are 3x3=9 possible genotypic combinations for the F2 birds. Each has a certain probability.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb: Checkered Brown? Wait, no. Wait, Bb is B dominant, so if the bird has at least one B, it's red. So CC Bb would still be Checkered Red.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nWait, let me correct myself: In gene B, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B is red. So CC Bb would be red, not brown.\n\nSimilarly, CC bb would also be red, since they have at least one B.\n\nSame logic applies to gene C: Any bird with at least one C is checkered, otherwise plain.\n\nSo the correct breakdown is:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Red\n3. CC bb: Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB: Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb: Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb: Checkered Red\n7. cc BB: Plain Red\n8. cc Bb: Plain Red\n9. cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nWait, that seems off because some might be missing. Let me clarify:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red (has C and B)\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Red (C and B)\n3. CC bb: Checkered Red (C and b, so at least one B)\n4. Cc BB: Checkered Red (Cc has C, BB has B)\n5. Cc Bb: Checkered Red (Cc and Bb)\n6. Cc bb: Checkered Red (Cc has C, bb has b)\n7. cc BB: Plain Red (cc has c, BB has B)\n8. cc Bb: Plain Red (cc has c, Bb has B)\n9. cc bb: Plain Brown (cc has c, bb has b)\n\nYes, all nine are correct. Now, how many of each phenotype?\n\nEach of the 16 possible genotypes (from Cc x Cc and Bb x Bb) in F2 would produce 1/4 of each, but since we're looking at the combined effect, each phenotype will correspond to a certain number of combinations.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to count the number of each type.\n\nLooking back, each of the nine phenotypes corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n- Checkered Red: All except those with cc and/or bb.\nWait, no, actually, every bird in F2 will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so:\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered Red | Either C or c, and either B or b\nCheckered Brown | Only c (so cc) and at least one B\nPlain Red | Only c (so cc) and only b (so bb)\nPlain Brown | Only c and only b\n\nSo now, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation is determined by how often each combination occurs.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance of each possible genotype. There are 16 possible combinations (from each gene), but considering dominance, each phenotype group is determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, to compute the frequency:\n\nFor Checkered Red (CR):\n\nThis occurs when at least one C and at least one B are present.\n\nThe number of such genotypes is:\n\nNumber of ways to have at least one C: 3 (CC, Cc, cC, etc.) but actually, for each gene, it's (number of C options). But since each bird's genotype is a product of the two genes, it's better to compute the probabilities.\n\nThe probability that a bird has at least one C is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of at least one B is 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of both happening is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, for Checkered Brown (CB):\n\nThis occurs when at least one C is present and no B.\n\nProbability of at least one C: 3/4.\n\nProbability of no B: 1/4.\n\nSo CB occurs when C is present and B is absent. So the probability is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nWait, but wait: Actually, for CB, the phenotype is red if there's at least one B, so to be CB, the bird must have at least one C and at least one B? No, wait: If B is absent, the bird doesn't have B, so it's brown. So CB would occur when there's at least one C and no B.\n\nSimilarly, for plain red (PR):\n\nThis happens when there's no C and at least one B.\n\nProbability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd plain brown (PB):\n\nBoth no C and no B, so probability (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nWait, but adding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 +1/16= 16/16=1, which checks out.\n\nSo the proportions are:\n\nCR: 9/16,\nCB: 3/16,\nPR: 3/16,\nPB: 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but looking at the options given, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, CR is 9/16, which would translate to 9 parts, CB is 3, PR is 3, PB is 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option D states exactly that: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nWait, hold on, in my calculation, CR is 9/16, which is 9 parts, but the answer options seem to have the counts per phenotype. Option D says checkered red 1, which would correspond to 9 parts, but scaled down.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the counts. Let me double-check.\n\nIf each bird in the F2 generation has equal probability of 1/16 for each possible genotype, but grouped by phenotype, then:\n\nTotal number of birds: 16.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\nCR: 9 (since 9/16 of 16 is 9)\nCB: 3\nPR: 3\nPB: 1\n\nWhich translates to the ratios as 9:3:3:1.\n\nThus, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which aligns perfectly with our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It involves dihybrid crosses because there are two genes involved\u2014gene C and gene B. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nThe birds have a checkered pattern controlled by gene C, which is dominant. So if someone has at least one C allele, they'll be checkered. The other allele is recessive (c), making them plain. Then, color is determined by another gene, B. If someone has a B allele, their feathers or eyes will be red. The other allele (b) makes them brown.\n\nNow, we're dealing with an adihybrid cross between two birds: one that's homozygously checkered red (so genotype CC BB) and another that's plain brown (cc bb). Wait, no\u2014the second bird is described as plain brown, but since it's homozygous, its genotype should be cc bb. But wait, let me make sure about the notation. Usually, uppercase letters denote dominant traits, and lowercase recessive. So CC would mean both alleles are dominant, so checkered. BB means both are B, making them red. Similarly, cc would make them plain, and bb would make them brown.\n\nSo the parent birds are CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown).\n\nWhen we cross these two, we get the F1 generation. Since one is homozygous and the other is homozygous recessive, all the offspring in F1 will inherit one allele from each parent. From CC BB, they can give either C or B. From cc bb, they can give either c or b. So the possible gametes are CcBb, which combines into CcBb for all offspring in F1. So the F1 generation is all CcBb.\n\nWait, but the user provided a Punnett square earlier, so maybe I don't need to go through that again. Okay, moving on.\n\nWe're supposed to look at the F2 generation. The cross mentioned is between two F1 individuals. Each F1 bird is CcBb, so when you cross them, you'll get an F2 generation where each gene behaves independently. So for each gene, the parents contribute either a dominant or recessive allele.\n\nLet me break down the genes separately first. Gene C: Parent is Cc. So in gametes, 50% C and 50% c. Gene B: Parent is Bb. So gametes are 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of C/B and c/b.\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC : 25%\n- Cc : 50%\n- cc : 25%\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB : 25%\n- Bb : 50%\n- bb : 25%\n\nBut since the F2 is from a cross of two CcBb parents, we need to combine these probabilities correctly. However, perhaps it's easier to think of it as each parent contributing Cc and Bb, leading to four possibilities:\n\nCC x BB \u2192 CcBb,\nCC x Bb \u2192 CcBb,\nCc x BB \u2192 CcBb,\nCc x Bb \u2192 CcBb,\n\nSo all F2 individuals are CcBb, meaning they have one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, but the initial description says to consider the phenotypes based on dominance and recessiveness. So for each gene, the presence of dominant alleles leads to a certain phenotype.\n\nSo for gene C: Checkered (at least one C) vs plain (only c).\nGene B: Red (at least one B) vs brown (only b).\n\nSo combining both, the F2 will have different combinations of these traits.\n\nIn F2, each bird will have:\n\n- Checkered if either C or c present.\n- Red if either B or b present.\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\nCheckered Red (both dominant),\nCheckered Brown (only C, B present),\nPlain Red (only c, B present),\nPlain Brown (only c, b present).\n\nWait, no, actually, the checkered phenotype depends on having at least one C allele regardless of B. So even if B is present, as long as C is present, it's checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, if B is absent but C is present, it's checkered brown. If neither is present, then it's plain.\n\nWait, no, the wording was: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So B is dominant, so any B allele makes it red, and without B, it's brown. Similarly, for C, c is recessive, so any c makes it plain, else checkered.\n\nTherefore, F2 would have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red: At least one C and at least one B.\n2. Checkered Brown: At least one C, no B (i.e., B is recessive).\n3. Plain Red: No C, at least one B.\n4. Plain Brown: No C, no B.\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype do we expect?\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Since the parents are CcBb x CcBb, each gene follows a Mendelian distribution.\n\nFor gene C: Probability of CC = 25%, Cc = 50%, cc = 25%.\n\nFor gene B: Probability of BB = 25%, Bb = 50%, bb = 25%.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nEach combination of C and B determines the phenotype.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): Both C and B present. Probability: (50% C)(50% B) = 25%. But wait, actually, since both genes are independent, the probability is (prob of C being present) * (prob of B being present). Because CR requires at least one C and at least one B. So the probability is (1 - cc) * (1 - bb) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%.\n\nWait, no. Actually, CR occurs when at least one C and at least one B are present. The probability is calculated as:\n\n(Probability of C being present) * (Probability of B being present) + ... Hmm, perhaps a better way is to subtract the non-C or non-B cases.\n\nAlternatively, the number of possible outcomes is 4^2 = 16 (since each gene has three possibilities, but considering dominant and recessive). But perhaps using probabilities directly is clearer.\n\nWait, no. For the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance of each possible genotype. But the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nActually, a more accurate approach is to list all possible combinations and their phenotypes.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities, so combined, there are 3x3=9 possible genotypic combinations for the F2 birds. Each has a certain probability.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb: Checkered Brown? Wait, no. Wait, Bb is B dominant, so if the bird has at least one B, it's red. So CC Bb would still be Checkered Red.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nWait, let me correct myself: In gene B, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B is red.

CC BB: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Red\n3. CC bb: Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB: Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb: Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb: Checkered Red\n7. cc BB: Plain Red\n8. cc Bb: Plain Red\n9. cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nWait, that seems off because some might be missing. Let me clarify:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red (has C and B)\n2.

Now, how many of each phenotype?\n\nEach of the 16 possible genotypes (from Cc x Cc and Bb x Bb) in F2 would produce 1/4 of each, but since we're looking at the combined effect, each phenotype will correspond to a certain number of combinations.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to count the number of each type.\n\nLooking back, each of the nine phenotypes corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n- Checkered Red: All except those with cc and/or bb.\nWait, no, actually, every bird in F2 will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so:\n\nWait, no.

So the probability is (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nWait, but wait: Actually, for CB, the phenotype is red if there's at least one B, so to be CB, the bird must have at least one C and at least one B? No, wait: If B is absent, the bird doesn't have B, so it's brown.

That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, CR is 9/16, which would translate to 9 parts, CB is 3, PR is 3, PB is 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option D states exactly that: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nWait, hold on, in my calculation, CR is 9/16, which is 9 parts, but the answer options seem to have the counts per phenotype.

    "chunk_resampled": "Let's break it down step by step.",
    "rollout": " Let's break it down step by step. First, there are two birds being crossed: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means its genotype must be CC BB because checkered red is dominant for both C and B. The other bird is a plain brown bird, so its genotype would be cc bb since plain is recessive for both genes.\n\nThe cross involves an adihybrid (which refers to dihybrid crosses in Mendelian genetics), but wait, actually, no\u2014the term \"adahybrid\" might be a typo or a misnomer here. It should probably mean a dihybrid cross, crossing two birds each with two different alleles for two traits.\n\nSo, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their offspring will form F1 generation through selfing, but wait, maybe not. Wait, no\u2014probably the cross is between these two birds, resulting in F1, which then selfs again to produce F2. But let me confirm that. Actually, when you have two birds crossed, each parent contributes gametes. So, the F1 generation is from CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more like each bird produces gametes, and those gametes combine to form the next generation. So, the F1 generation comes from CC BB and cc bb. When they mate, their offspring are F1. Then, if we're looking at F2, that would come from F1 individuals.\n\nBut the question mentions showing the F2 generation's phenotypes, genotypes, etc., so perhaps I need to consider the dihybrid cross between F1 individuals?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's simpler than that. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, all F1 offspring will be Cc Bb. Then, F2 will result from selfing F1, leading to a dihybrid cross where the possible genotypes are CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, and cc bb, among others. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's just considering the F1 as the initial cross for the F2 calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So, the F1 would be Cc Bb. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 would have various genotypes. However, the question seems to present the F2 as already calculated, so perhaps I don't need to go through the entire process of F1 and F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking about the F2 generation without going into F1 steps, given that the options provided list specific phenotypic ratios for F2.\n\nLooking at the options, most of them mention four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, the question is about determining how many birds fall into each category in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, I'll use the Punnett square method. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Each parent can only produce gametes with one allele for each trait, due to their dominance. So, the F1 generation would consist of all Cc Bb birds. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 will have a dihybrid cross where each trait is independent.\n\nFor each trait, the probability of producing a certain allele is 25% for each possibility. Since both genes are independently assorting, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, in this case, the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two traits. Checkered red would occur when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both traits, while checkered brown would require at least one dominant allele for the first trait and at least one recessive for the second. Plain red would require at least one dominant allele for the second trait and at least one recessive for the first, and plain brown would be when both are recessive.\n\nCalculating the phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: All combinations except checkered brown. There are 3 possibilities for brown and 3 for red, totaling 9. Subtracting the 3 brown checkered cases leaves 6 checkered red.\n- Checkered brown: Only when the first trait is dominant and the second is recessive. That's 3 cases (from the brown gene).\n- Plain red: When the second trait is dominant and the first is recessive. Again, 3 cases.\n- Plain brown: When both traits are recessive, which is 1 case.\n\nThus, the ratios are 6:2:2:1. But wait, none of the options match exactly. Let me look back.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. In the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but depending on whether some traits are dominant or recessive, the actual numbers change. Here, checkered red is dominant for both traits, so any bird with at least one dominant allele for both will be checkered red. Similarly, checkered brown requires at least one dominant allele for the first trait and at least one recessive for the second. Plain red requires at least one dominant allele for the second trait and at least one recessive for the first. Plain brown requires both recessive for both traits.\n\nLet me count the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\n- Checkered red: All birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. In the 9:3:3:1 ratio, that's 9 - 3 = 6.\n- Checkered brown: Birds with at least one C (since it's dominant) and at least one b (recessive). That's 3.\n- Plain red: Birds with at least one c and at least one B. That's another 3.\n- Plain brown: Birds with neither dominant C nor dominant B, i.e., both recessive. That's 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratios are 6:2:2:1, but in terms of the options provided, option A is 6:2:2:1, but that doesn't match any of the given answer choices directly.

Or is it that checkered is dominant for color, meaning that having at least one dominant allele results in checkered, and the absence leads to plain?\n\nSimilarly, for B and b: checkered is dominant (B), plain is recessive (b).\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both B and b.\n\nTherefore, checkered red would be C_B_, and plain brown would be _b_bb.\n\nCheckered brown would be Cb_bb, and plain red would be ccB_.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross would be 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for the dominance hierarchy.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but if the dominant phenotype is for both traits, then the counts adjust accordingly.\n\nGiven that checkered red is dominant for both traits, any bird with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B will be checkered red. Similarly, checkered brown requires at least one dominant C and at least one recessive b (so, Cb and cc), but since it's dominance, the presence of even one dominant C makes it checkered, regardless of the b.\n\nPlain red would require at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B. Plain brown is when both are recessive (cc and bb).\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 (since it's a dihybrid cross, 9+3+3+1=16)\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Checkered red: All birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. This includes all cases except when both are recessive (checkered brown) and when only one is dominant for one trait. Wait, no, in reality, the 9:3:3:1 applies directly.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct way is that in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. So, assuming that the dominant phenotype is present when either trait is dominant, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, in our case, the dominant phenotype for both traits is checkered red, which takes 9 cases, followed by checkered brown (3), plain red (3), and plain brown (1). So, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut none of the answer options reflect this. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16 total.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same total.\n\nHmm, but according to the calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the phenotypic ratios are presented differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that checkered red is dominant for both traits, so any bird with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B is checkered red, and the rest are checked against the other traits.\n\nWait, but in the dihybrid cross, the 9:3:3:1 accounts for all possible combinations, so the checkered red would take 9/16, checkered brown 3/16, plain red 3/16, and plain brown 1/16.\n\nBut the options provided don't include 9:3:3:1. Instead, they have varying numbers. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy such that checkered red is dominant for both traits, so any bird with at least one dominant allele for both traits is checkered red, and the rest are considered based on the other traits. But I think that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, counting the number of each phenotype based on the possible gamete combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the probabilities directly.\n\nEach bird in F2 will have a 25% chance for each allele. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, all F1 will be Cc Bb. Then, F2 is from F1 selfing.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n\n- CC Bb (25%)\n\n- cc BB (25%)\n\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nThen, the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two traits.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Dominant C leads to checkered for color.\n\n- Dominant B leads to red color.\n\n- Recessive c leads to plain color.\n\n- Recessive B leads to brown color.\n\nSo, a bird is checkered red if it has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B.\n\nIt is checkered brown if it has at least one dominant C and at least one recessive b.\n\nIt is plain red if it has at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B.\n\nIt is plain brown if it has neither dominant C nor dominant B, i.e., both recessive.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 birds.\n\n- Checkered red: All that have at least one C and at least one B.\n\nHow many are that? Well, in a dihybrid cross, that's 9.\n\nWait, but according to the previous calculation, yes.\n\n- Checkered brown: At least one C and at least one b.\n\nThis occurs in 3 cases.\n\n- Plain red: At least one c and at least one B.\n\nAgain, 3 cases.\n\n- Plain brown: Neither C nor B, so 1 case.\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16.\n\nBut the options provided don't include this ratio. They all sum to 16 except for option J, which sums to 12. Let me check option J:\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nThat sums to 12, which doesn't make sense because F2 should have 16 birds.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since checkered red is dominant for both traits, any bird with at least one dominant allele for both traits is checkered red, and the remaining are categorized based on their other traits.\n\nSo, the count would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n\n- Checkered brown: 3 (only C and not B)\n\n- Plain red: 3 (not C and B)\n\n- Plain brown: 1 (neither)\n\nYes, that adds up to 16.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact ratio.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's break it down step by step. First, there are two birds being crossed: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means its genotype must be CC BB because checkered red is dominant for both C and B. The other bird is a plain brown bird, so its genotype would be cc bb since plain is recessive for both genes.\n\nThe cross involves an adihybrid (which refers to dihybrid crosses in Mendelian genetics), but wait, actually, no\u2014the term \"adahybrid\" might be a typo or a misnomer here. It should probably mean a dihybrid cross, crossing two birds each with two different alleles for two traits.\n\nSo, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their offspring will form F1 generation through selfing, but wait, maybe not. Wait, no\u2014probably the cross is between these two birds, resulting in F1, which then selfs again to produce F2. But let me confirm that. Actually, when you have two birds crossed, each parent contributes gametes. So, the F1 generation is from CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more like each bird produces gametes, and those gametes combine to form the next generation. So, the F1 generation comes from CC BB and cc bb. When they mate, their offspring are F1. Then, if we're looking at F2, that would come from F1 individuals.\n\nBut the question mentions showing the F2 generation's phenotypes, genotypes, etc., so perhaps I need to consider the dihybrid cross between F1 individuals?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's simpler than that. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, all F1 offspring will be Cc Bb. Then, F2 will result from selfing F1, leading to a dihybrid cross where the possible genotypes are CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, and cc bb, among others. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's just considering the F1 as the initial cross for the F2 calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So, the F1 would be Cc Bb. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 would have various genotypes. However, the question seems to present the F2 as already calculated, so perhaps I don't need to go through the entire process of F1 and F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking about the F2 generation without going into F1 steps, given that the options provided list specific phenotypic ratios for F2.\n\nLooking at the options, most of them mention four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, the question is about determining how many birds fall into each category in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, I'll use the Punnett square method. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Each parent can only produce gametes with one allele for each trait, due to their dominance. So, the F1 generation would consist of all Cc Bb birds. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 will have a dihybrid cross where each trait is independent.\n\nFor each trait, the probability of producing a certain allele is 25% for each possibility. Since both genes are independently assorting, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, in this case, the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two traits. Checkered red would occur when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both traits, while checkered brown would require at least one dominant allele for the first trait and at least one recessive for the second. Plain red would require at least one dominant allele for the second trait and at least one recessive for the first, and plain brown would be when both are recessive.\n\nCalculating the phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: All combinations except checkered brown. There are 3 possibilities for brown and 3 for red, totaling 9. Subtracting the 3 brown checkered cases leaves 6 checkered red.\n- Checkered brown: Only when the first trait is dominant and the second is recessive. That's 3 cases (from the brown gene).\n- Plain red: When the second trait is dominant and the first is recessive. Again, 3 cases.\n- Plain brown: When both traits are recessive, which is 1 case.\n\nThus, the ratios are 6:2:2:1. But wait, none of the options match exactly. Let me look back.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. In the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but depending on whether some traits are dominant or recessive, the actual numbers change. Here, checkered red is dominant for both traits, so any bird with at least one dominant allele for both will be checkered red. Similarly, checkered brown requires at least one dominant allele for the first trait and at least one recessive for the second. Plain red requires at least one dominant allele for the second trait and at least one recessive for the first. Plain brown requires both recessive for both traits.\n\nLet me count the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\n- Checkered red: All birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. In the 9:3:3:1 ratio, that's 9 - 3 = 6.\n- Checkered brown: Birds with at least one C (since it's dominant) and at least one b (recessive). That's 3.\n- Plain red: Birds with at least one c and at least one B. That's another 3.\n- Plain brown: Birds with neither dominant C nor dominant B, i.e., both recessive. That's 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratios are 6:2:2:1, but in terms of the options provided, option A is 6:2:2:1, but that doesn't match any of the given answer choices directly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 2, 2, 1 \u2192 Sum is 11\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum is 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192Sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192Sum16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192Sum16\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192Sum16\nG.12,2,2,0\u2192Sum16\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192Sum16\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192Sum16\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192Sum12\nK.4,4,4,4\u2192Same as F\nL.12,2,2,0\u2192Same as G\nM.5,3,2,6\u2192Same as H\nN.7,5,1,3\u2192Same as I\n\nWait, none of these options have 6,2,2,1.

    "rollout": " Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is plain brown (cc bb). We need to determine the phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation based on a Punnett square.\n\nFirst, I remember that each bird has two alleles for each trait. So, let's break down the parents' genes.\n\nParent 1 (homozygous checkered red): CC BB. Since both are dominant, all offspring will inherit these, making them also checkered red.\n\nParent 2 (plain brown): cc bb. Both alleles are recessive here, so all offspring will be plain brown.\n\nWait, but the cross is between CC BB and cc bb. But since they're both homozygous, how does that affect the cross? Normally, when you have two different parents, one heterozygous and one homozygous recessive, like Aa aa, the F1 would get A from parent Aa and a from parent aa. But here, both parents are homozygous, so maybe the cross isn't as straightforward. Hmm, perhaps the F1 is just another heterozygote?\n\nBut actually, wait\u2014the initial statement says \"adahybridcross,\" which might mean something else, but I think in this context, it refers to a dihybrid cross between two different parents. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the parents are different\u2014like one is heterozygous and the other homozygous recessive\u2014but in this case, they are both homozygous. That seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's an error and they meant a dihybrid cross between two different parents. But given the information, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, considering Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous, the possible gametes they can produce are:\n\nFrom Parent 1:\n- CC (since both alleles are dominant)\nFrom Parent 2:\n- cc (since both alleles are recessive)\n\nNow, when we cross these two, each gamete from Parent 1 combines with each gamete from Parent 2. So the F1 would receive either CC or cc from Parent 1 and cc or cc from Parent 2. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because Parent 2 can only give cc. So the F1 would only receive cc from Parent 2, and either CC or cc from Parent 1. Therefore, the F1 would all be cc BB or cc bb.\n\nWait, but that would mean all F1s are either checkered red (cc BB) or plain brown (cc bb). Then, the next generation, F2, would result from the F1 selfing.\n\nLet me correct that. If both parents are homozygous, then F1 would be:\n\nEach parent produces gametes:\n- From Parent 1: CC (since both alleles are dominant)\n- From Parent 2: cc (both alleles are recessive)\n\nTherefore, F1 would be CC (from Parent 1) + cc (from Parent 2) = Cc. Similarly, cc (from Parent 2) + CC (from Parent 1) = Cc. So all F1s are Cc.\n\nThen, F2 would come from F1 selfing. Each F1 individual (Cc) would produce gametes as follows:\n\n- 50% C\n- 50% c\n\nSo, when F1 (Cc) self, the Punnett square would be:\n\nCC x Cc \u2192 C C, C c, c C, c c \u2192 but since C and c are dominant and recessive respectively, all offspring would be Cc, meaning they would express the dominant traits.\n\nWait, but in reality, since C is dominant over c, all offspring would be Cc and thus exhibit the dominant phenotype. However, the question mentions checking the phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the original question was about a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb, but if both parents are homozygous, the cross might not follow typical Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo and they meant a cross between CC bb and cc BB, which would yield F1 as Cc Bb and F2 with various genotypes leading to different phenotypes.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume that the intended parents were CC bb and cc BB, allowing for proper dihybrid crosses.\n\nSo, assuming Parent 1 is CC bb and Parent 2 is cc BB.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC (homozygous dominant for C) and bb (homozygous recessive for b)\n- Parent 2: cc (homozygous recessive for C) and BB (homozygous dominant for B)\n\nCrossing these together would lead to F1 as Cc Bb, since each parent contributes one allele for each trait.\n\nThe F1 would be Cc Bb, which would express dominant traits, so all Cc Bb individuals would be checkered brown.\n\nThen, F2 would result from F1 selfing, producing various genotypes:\n\nFor each trait (C and B):\n- CC : 25%\n- Cc : 50%\n- cc : 25%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB : 25%\n- Bb : 50%\n- bb : 25%\n\nCombining these, the Punnett square for F2 would have a grid where each combination of Cc and Bb is considered. The resulting genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (checkered brown)\n- CC Bb (checkered brown)\n- CC bb (checkered white)\n- Cc BB (checkered brown)\n- Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- Cc bb (checkered yellow)\n- cc BB (plain brown)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cc bb (plain white)\n\nWait, but that depends on whether the traits are independent. Assuming they are, the phenotypes would depend on the combination of C and B. Since C is dominant, any presence of C results in dominant phenotype, same with B. So all Cc and Bb individuals would display dominant traits.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n- Checkered Brown (if at least one dominant allele)\n- Checkered White (only cc)\n- Plain Brown (only bb)\n- Plain White (only bb, but more accurately, only cc and bb)\n\nWait, but in the previous scenario, I had some of the F1 being Cc Bb. When F1 (Cc Bb) self-pairs, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\nCC BB (C dominant for C and B dominant for B \u2192 checkered brown)\nCC Bb (same)\nCC bb (checkered white)\nCc BB (checkered brown)\nCc Bb (checkered brown)\nCc bb (checkered yellow)\ncc BB (plain brown)\ncc Bb (plain brown)\ncc bb (plain white)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n- Checkered Brown: All except those without C and/or B.\n- Checkered White: Only cc bb.\n- Plain Brown: Only cc BB and cc bb?\nWait, no. Because in the F2, the genotype cc bb would be plain white, while cc BB would be plain brown. Similarly, CC BB would be checkered brown.\n\nWait, no, actually, in terms of phenotypes, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- Any genotype with C (dominant for C) \u2192 dominant phenotype for C.\n- Any genotype with B (dominant for B) \u2192 dominant phenotype for B.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: All individuals with at least one C and at least one B (so Cc Bb and CC Bb).\n- Checkered White: Only those with cc bb.\n- Plain Brown: Those with cc BB (since they don't have C, so only B is present).\n- Plain White: Those with cc bb and only bb.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotypes would be expressed based on the dominant alleles. So, any individual with at least one C or B would express their respective phenotype. Thus:\n\n- Checkered Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, CC bb, Cc bb (all have C or B, so brown)\n- Checkered White: cc bb (no C or B)\n- Plain Brown: only BB in the presence of cc \u2192 but wait, in the F2, the presence of B would mean brown. But in the case of cc BB, since B is present, it would be brown. However, in the absence of C, it's white.\n\nWait, no, because C determines the color for the first trait, and B determines the second. So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 phenotype is brown.\n- Checkered White: Only cc bb (no C or B).\n- Plain Brown: At least one B, regardless of C \u2192 phenotype is brown.\n- Plain White: Only cc and no B \u2192 phenotype is white.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the presence of B always leads to brown, unless the person is entirely white (no B).\n\nSo, now, calculating the number of each phenotype:\n\nIn F2, the total number of offspring is 16.\n\nPhenotype distribution:\n\n- Checkered Brown (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb): Let's count how many. Each trait can be either dominant or recessive. Since C is dominant, any presence of C means brown. Similarly, B is dominant, so any presence of B means brown. So, any genotype with at least one C or at least one B is brown. The only exception is when both are absent (cc bb).\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because for brown, it's either at least one C or at least one B. So, all individuals who have at least one C or at least one B will express brown. The only exception is when they have neither, i.e., cc bb.\n\nSimilarly, for white, it's only when both are absent: cc and no B.\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Checkered Brown: All except cc bb. How many? In the F2 grid, the number of individuals with at least one C or at least one B is 15 (since only one individual is all white). Wait, no, because in the F2, some have C and others have B.\n\nActually, using the Punnett square approach, each trait is independent, so the probability of having at least one dominant allele is:\n\nFor each trait, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of both being recessive). Since both traits are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for having at least one dominant allele in either trait.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait is independent, so the probability of having at least one dominant allele in either trait is indeed 3/4 for each trait, multiplied together.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. For a single trait, say C, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is 3/4. Similarly for B. Since the two traits are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for having at least one dominant allele in either trait.\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes, brown occurs if at least one of the traits is dominant. So, the number of brown individuals is 16 - 1 = 15 (since only cc bb is all white). Wait, no, because even if one trait is dominant and the other is recessive, they still show the dominant phenotype. Wait, but in reality, brown is expressed when at least one dominant allele exists in either trait. So, the only individual without any dominant alleles is cc and bb. Hence, 15 individuals are brown, and 1 is white.\n\nWait, but according to the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is often 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four combinations of dominant and recessive traits. So, in this case, since both traits are dominant, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C and B dominant)\n- Checkered White (only cc)\n- Plain Brown (only B)\n- Plain White (only cc and no B)\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because in the case of C, if someone is Cc, they have the dominant trait C, so brown. Similarly, for B, if someone is Bb, they have the dominant trait B, so brown. Therefore, any individual with at least one dominant allele in either trait will be brown, regardless of the other trait. The only exception is when both are recessive, i.e., cc and bb.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 9 individuals (as per the 3/4 chance for each trait, squared gives 9/16)\n- Checkered White: 3 individuals (only cc)\n- Plain Brown: 3 individuals (only Bb)\n- Plain White: 1 individual (cc and bb)\n\nAdding up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis matches our calculation: 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered white, 3 plain brown, 1 plain white.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is plain brown (cc bb). We need to determine the phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation based on a Punnett square.\n\nFirst, I remember that each bird has two alleles for each trait. So, let's break down the parents' genes.\n\nParent 1 (homozygous checkered red): CC BB. Since both are dominant, all offspring will inherit these, making them also checkered red.\n\nParent 2 (plain brown): cc bb. Both alleles are recessive here, so all offspring will be plain brown.\n\nWait, but the cross is between CC BB and cc bb. But since they're both homozygous, how does that affect the cross? Normally, when you have two different parents, one heterozygous and one homozygous recessive, like Aa aa, the F1 would get A from parent Aa and a from parent aa. But here, both parents are homozygous, so maybe the cross isn't as straightforward. Hmm, perhaps the F1 is just another heterozygote?\n\nBut actually, wait\u2014the initial statement says \"adahybridcross,\" which might mean something else, but I think in this context, it refers to a dihybrid cross between two different parents. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the parents are different\u2014like one is heterozygous and the other homozygous recessive\u2014but in this case, they are both homozygous. That seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's an error and they meant a dihybrid cross between two different parents. But given the information, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, considering Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous, the possible gametes they can produce are:\n\nFrom Parent 1:\n- CC (since both alleles are dominant)\nFrom Parent 2:\n- cc (since both alleles are recessive)\n\nNow, when we cross these two, each gamete from Parent 1 combines with each gamete from Parent 2. So the F1 would receive either CC or cc from Parent 1 and cc or cc from Parent 2. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because Parent 2 can only give cc. So the F1 would only receive cc from Parent 2, and either CC or cc from Parent 1. Therefore, the F1 would all be cc BB or cc bb.\n\nWait, but that would mean all F1s are either checkered red (cc BB) or plain brown (cc bb). Then, the next generation, F2, would result from the F1 selfing.\n\nLet me correct that. If both parents are homozygous, then F1 would be:\n\nEach parent produces gametes:\n- From Parent 1: CC (since both alleles are dominant)\n- From Parent 2: cc (both alleles are recessive)\n\nTherefore, F1 would be CC (from Parent 1) + cc (from Parent 2) = Cc. Similarly, cc (from Parent 2) + CC (from Parent 1) = Cc. So all F1s are Cc.\n\nThen, F2 would come from F1 selfing. Each F1 individual (Cc) would produce gametes as follows:\n\n- 50% C\n- 50% c\n\nSo, when F1 (Cc) self, the Punnett square would be:\n\nCC x Cc \u2192 C C, C c, c C, c c \u2192 but since C and c are dominant and recessive respectively, all offspring would be Cc, meaning they would express the dominant traits.\n\nWait, but in reality, since C is dominant over c, all offspring would be Cc and thus exhibit the dominant phenotype. However, the question mentions checking the phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the original question was about a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb, but if both parents are homozygous, the cross might not follow typical Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo and they meant a cross between CC bb and cc BB, which would yield F1 as Cc Bb and F2 with various genotypes leading to different phenotypes.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume that the intended parents were CC bb and cc BB, allowing for proper dihybrid crosses.\n\nSo, assuming Parent 1 is CC bb and Parent 2 is cc BB.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC (homozygous dominant for C) and bb (homozygous recessive for b)\n- Parent 2: cc (homozygous recessive for C) and BB (homozygous dominant for B)\n\nCrossing these together would lead to F1 as Cc Bb, since each parent contributes one allele for each trait.\n\nThe F1 would be Cc Bb, which would express dominant traits, so all Cc Bb individuals would be checkered brown.\n\nThen, F2 would result from F1 selfing, producing various genotypes:\n\nFor each trait (C and B):\n- CC : 25%\n- Cc : 50%\n- cc : 25%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB : 25%\n- Bb : 50%\n- bb : 25%\n\nCombining these, the Punnett square for F2 would have a grid where each combination of Cc and Bb is considered. The resulting genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (checkered brown)\n- CC Bb (checkered brown)\n- CC bb (checkered white)\n- Cc BB (checkered brown)\n- Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- Cc bb (checkered yellow)\n- cc BB (plain brown)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n- cc bb (plain white)\n\nWait, but that depends on whether the traits are independent. Assuming they are, the phenotypes would depend on the combination of C and B. Since C is dominant, any presence of C results in dominant phenotype, same with B. So all Cc and Bb individuals would display dominant traits.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n- Checkered Brown (if at least one dominant allele)\n- Checkered White (only cc)\n- Plain Brown (only bb)\n- Plain White (only bb, but more accurately, only cc and bb)\n\nWait, but in the previous scenario, I had some of the F1 being Cc Bb. When F1 (Cc Bb) self-pairs, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\nCC BB (C dominant for C and B dominant for B \u2192 checkered brown)\nCC Bb (same)\nCC bb (checkered white)\nCc BB (checkered brown)\nCc Bb (checkered brown)\nCc bb (checkered yellow)\ncc BB (plain brown)\ncc Bb (plain brown)\ncc bb (plain white)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n- Checkered Brown: All except those without C and/or B.\n- Checkered White: Only cc bb.\n- Plain Brown: Only cc BB and cc bb?\nWait, no. Because in the F2, the genotype cc bb would be plain white, while cc BB would be plain brown. Similarly, CC BB would be checkered brown.\n\nWait, no, actually, in terms of phenotypes, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- Any genotype with C (dominant for C) \u2192 dominant phenotype for C.\n- Any genotype with B (dominant for B) \u2192 dominant phenotype for B.\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: All individuals with at least one C and at least one B (so Cc Bb and CC Bb).\n- Checkered White: Only those with cc bb.\n- Plain Brown: Those with cc BB (since they don't have C, so only B is present).\n- Plain White: Those with cc bb and only bb.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotypes would be expressed based on the dominant alleles. So, any individual with at least one C or B would express their respective phenotype. Thus:\n\n- Checkered Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, CC bb, Cc bb (all have C or B, so brown)\n- Checkered White: cc bb (no C or B)\n- Plain Brown: only BB in the presence of cc \u2192 but wait, in the F2, the presence of B would mean brown. But in the case of cc BB, since B is present, it would be brown. However, in the absence of C, it's white.\n\nWait, no, because C determines the color for the first trait, and B determines the second. So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 phenotype is brown.\n- Checkered White: Only cc bb (no C or B).\n- Plain Brown: At least one B, regardless of C \u2192 phenotype is brown.\n- Plain White: Only cc and no B \u2192 phenotype is white.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the presence of B always leads to brown, unless the person is entirely white (no B).\n\nSo, now, calculating the number of each phenotype:\n\nIn F2, the total number of offspring is 16.\n\nPhenotype distribution:\n\n- Checkered Brown (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb): Let's count how many.

    "rollout": " It involves a punnet square for an adihybrid cross between two birds. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nThe first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means it has the genotype CC BB. The second bird is a plain brown bird with the genotype cc bb. They're crossing these two birds, and I need to determine the phenotypic ratios in their offspring's F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the genes involved. There are two pairs of genes: one pair determining the pigment color (C and c), and another determining whether the bird is checkered or plain (B and b). \n\nFor the pigment color:\n- The dominant allele C produces checkered pigeons.\n- The recessive allele c produces plain pigeons.\n\nFor the eye color:\n- The dominant allele B produces red pigeons.\n- The recessive allele b produces brown pigeons.\n\nSo each bird can be represented as a genotype combination of these two traits. Let's consider each trait separately to simplify things.\n\nStarting with the pigmentation (C and c):\n- Homozygous dominant (CC) \u2192 Checkered red.\n- Heterozygous (Cc or Cc) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n- Homozygous recessive (cc) \u2192 Plain red.\n\nNow, the eye color (B and b):\n- Homozygous dominant (BB) \u2192 Red.\n- Heterozygous (Bb or Bb) \u2192 Brown.\n- Homozygous recessive (bb) \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSince the two parents are homozygous for one trait but heterozygous for the other, we'll have to look at how each trait is inherited independently because they are on different chromosomes. This should form independent assortment, meaning the alleles for pigment and eye color assort independently during gamete formation.\n\nLet's construct the Punnett square for the cross between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nEach parent will produce four types of gametes:\n1. From CC BB: since both alleles are dominant (C and B), all gametes will be CB.\n   - So the possible gametes from CC BB are CB, CB, CB, CB. Wait, that doesn't seem right. No, actually, each parent is CC BB, so for pigment (C), the gametes would be C (since CC is homozygous dominant). For eye color (B), the gametes would also be B (homozygous dominant). Therefore, all gametes are CB.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Each bird is CC BB, so when crossed with cc bb, the gametes formed are:\n\nFrom CC (pigment): C can make gametes C or C? Wait, no\u2014each bird is CC BB, so for pigment (C), it's CC, so gametes are C. For eye color (B), it's BB, so gametes are B. Thus, all gametes are CB.\n\nSimilarly, the other parent is cc bb. For pigment (c), it's cc, so gametes are c. For eye color (b), it's bb, so gametes are b. Thus, all gametes are cb.\n\nWhen you combine these, the F1 generation will be Cc Bb. Because each parent contributes either C or c for pigment, and B or b for eye color. Since they're independent, the F1 genotype is Cc Bb.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions F2 generation, so maybe I'm mixing up steps here. Actually, the initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in an F1 generation of Cc Bb. Then, the F1 selfs (F2) occur.\n\nSo for the F2 generation, we'll have to consider the dihybrid cross again, with the parents being Cc Bb x Cc Bb.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, it might change based on the actual combinations.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for Cc x Cc and Bb x Bb, then combining the results.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the possible gametes from each parent.\n\nParent 1: CC BB\n- Pigment (C): dominant, so all gametes will carry C.\n- Eye color (B): dominant, so all gametes will carry B.\nThus, gametes: CB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb\n- Pigment (c): recessive, so all gametes will carry c.\n- Eye color (b): recessive, so all gametes will carry b.\nThus, gametes: cb.\n\nWhen these combine, each parent gives either CB or cb, but since they're monohybrid, the F1 generation will be Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 (Cc Bb) selfs to get F2.\n\nUsing the dihybrid cross formula, where the parents are Cc Bb x Cc Bb.\n\nThe possible gametes from Cc Bb are Cc and Bb, each with a probability of 25%.\n\nTherefore, the Punnett square would look like:\n\n          | Cc | Bb\n        -----------------\n        Cc      | CC | Cc\n        Bb       | Cc | Bb\n\nSo the F2 generation will have four types:\n- CC (checkered red)\n- Cc (checkered brown)\n- Bb (plain brown)\n- Bb (plain brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypes depend on both traits. Let me map them correctly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both pigment and eye color.\n\nFor pigment:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Checkered red.\n- Cc or Cc \u2192 Checkered brown?\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more precise to say that if the bird is Cc (heterozygous), it'll have a mix of C and c, producing both checkered and brown. But typically, in genetics, a heterozygote shows the dominant trait unless there's incomplete dominance, which isn't mentioned here. So in this case, C is dominant, so Cc would result in checkered (since the pigment is expressed regardless of the eye color).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by the dominant gene C. So any bird with at least one C allele will be checkered. Similarly, any bird with at least one B allele will be red. Only those without C or B will be plain.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nTherefore, for each bird, we need to determine if they're checkered or plain (based on C) and red or brown (based on B).\n\nSo let's list all F2 possibilities:\n\n1. CC (C from both parents) and BB (B from both parents): Checkered red.\n2. CC and Bb: Checkered brown.\n3. Cc and Bb: Checkered brown (since C is present).\n4. Cc and BB: Checkered red.\n5. Cc and Bb: Checkered brown.\n6. Cc and BB: Checkered red.\n7. Cc and Bb: Checkered brown.\n8. Cc and BB: Checkered red.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing myself. Let me structure it properly.\n\nEach bird in F2 is a combination of Cc and Bb. So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (if both parents contribute C)\n- Cc (if one parent contributes C and the other contributes c)\n- Bb (if both parents contribute B)\n- BB (if both contribute B)\n\nBut wait, each parent is Cc Bb, so all F2 individuals will be Cc Bb, right? Or am I misunderstanding the cross?\n\nNo, the cross is between Cc Bb and Cc Bb. So each parent produces gametes Cc and Bb with equal probability.\n\nSo each F2 individual will receive either Cc or Bb from each parent, leading to four possible combinations:\n\n1. Cc from first parent and Cc from second parent: Cc x Cc \u2192 CC, Cc, Cc, cc.\n2. Cc x Bb: Cc x Bb \u2192 Cc, Cc, Bb, Bb.\n3. Bb x Cc: same as above.\n4. Bb x Bb: Bb x Bb \u2192 BB, Bb, Bb, bb.\n\nThen, when combined, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the probabilities directly.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the probability of each genotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor eye color (B/b):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nHowever, when considering both traits together, the phenotypic ratios come from the combination of these probabilities.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we can multiply the probabilities of each trait occurring together.\n\nBut since both traits are influenced independently, the total phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a grid of all possible combinations and count the phenotypes.\n\nLet's outline all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It involves a punnet square for an adihybrid cross between two birds. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nThe first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means it has the genotype CC BB. The second bird is a plain brown bird with the genotype cc bb. They're crossing these two birds, and I need to determine the phenotypic ratios in their offspring's F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the genes involved. There are two pairs of genes: one pair determining the pigment color (C and c), and another determining whether the bird is checkered or plain (B and b). \n\nFor the pigment color:\n- The dominant allele C produces checkered pigeons.\n- The recessive allele c produces plain pigeons.\n\nFor the eye color:\n- The dominant allele B produces red pigeons.\n- The recessive allele b produces brown pigeons.\n\nSo each bird can be represented as a genotype combination of these two traits. Let's consider each trait separately to simplify things.\n\nStarting with the pigmentation (C and c):\n- Homozygous dominant (CC) \u2192 Checkered red.\n- Heterozygous (Cc or Cc) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n- Homozygous recessive (cc) \u2192 Plain red.\n\nNow, the eye color (B and b):\n- Homozygous dominant (BB) \u2192 Red.\n- Heterozygous (Bb or Bb) \u2192 Brown.\n- Homozygous recessive (bb) \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSince the two parents are homozygous for one trait but heterozygous for the other, we'll have to look at how each trait is inherited independently because they are on different chromosomes. This should form independent assortment, meaning the alleles for pigment and eye color assort independently during gamete formation.\n\nLet's construct the Punnett square for the cross between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nEach parent will produce four types of gametes:\n1. From CC BB: since both alleles are dominant (C and B), all gametes will be CB.\n   - So the possible gametes from CC BB are CB, CB, CB, CB. Wait, that doesn't seem right. No, actually, each parent is CC BB, so for pigment (C), the gametes would be C (since CC is homozygous dominant). For eye color (B), the gametes would also be B (homozygous dominant). Therefore, all gametes are CB.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Each bird is CC BB, so when crossed with cc bb, the gametes formed are:\n\nFrom CC (pigment): C can make gametes C or C? Wait, no\u2014each bird is CC BB, so for pigment (C), it's CC, so gametes are C. For eye color (B), it's BB, so gametes are B. Thus, all gametes are CB.\n\nSimilarly, the other parent is cc bb. For pigment (c), it's cc, so gametes are c. For eye color (b), it's bb, so gametes are b. Thus, all gametes are cb.\n\nWhen you combine these, the F1 generation will be Cc Bb. Because each parent contributes either C or c for pigment, and B or b for eye color. Since they're independent, the F1 genotype is Cc Bb.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions F2 generation, so maybe I'm mixing up steps here. Actually, the initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in an F1 generation of Cc Bb. Then, the F1 selfs (F2) occur.\n\nSo for the F2 generation, we'll have to consider the dihybrid cross again, with the parents being Cc Bb x Cc Bb.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, it might change based on the actual combinations.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for Cc x Cc and Bb x Bb, then combining the results.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the possible gametes from each parent.\n\nParent 1: CC BB\n- Pigment (C): dominant, so all gametes will carry C.\n- Eye color (B): dominant, so all gametes will carry B.\nThus, gametes: CB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb\n- Pigment (c): recessive, so all gametes will carry c.\n- Eye color (b): recessive, so all gametes will carry b.\nThus, gametes: cb.\n\nWhen these combine, each parent gives either CB or cb, but since they're monohybrid, the F1 generation will be Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 (Cc Bb) selfs to get F2.\n\nUsing the dihybrid cross formula, where the parents are Cc Bb x Cc Bb.\n\nThe possible gametes from Cc Bb are Cc and Bb, each with a probability of 25%.\n\nTherefore, the Punnett square would look like:\n\n          | Cc | Bb\n        -----------------\n        Cc      | CC | Cc\n        Bb       | Cc | Bb\n\nSo the F2 generation will have four types:\n- CC (checkered red)\n- Cc (checkered brown)\n- Bb (plain brown)\n- Bb (plain brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypes depend on both traits. Let me map them correctly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both pigment and eye color.\n\nFor pigment:\n- CC or Cc \u2192 Checkered red.\n- Cc or Cc \u2192 Checkered brown?\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more precise to say that if the bird is Cc (heterozygous), it'll have a mix of C and c, producing both checkered and brown. But typically, in genetics, a heterozygote shows the dominant trait unless there's incomplete dominance, which isn't mentioned here. So in this case, C is dominant, so Cc would result in checkered (since the pigment is expressed regardless of the eye color).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by the dominant gene C. So any bird with at least one C allele will be checkered. Similarly, any bird with at least one B allele will be red. Only those without C or B will be plain.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nTherefore, for each bird, we need to determine if they're checkered or plain (based on C) and red or brown (based on B).\n\nSo let's list all F2 possibilities:\n\n1. CC (C from both parents) and BB (B from both parents): Checkered red.\n2. CC and Bb: Checkered brown.\n3. Cc and Bb: Checkered brown (since C is present).\n4. Cc and BB: Checkered red.\n5. Cc and Bb: Checkered brown.\n6. Cc and BB: Checkered red.\n7. Cc and Bb: Checkered brown.\n8. Cc and BB: Checkered red.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing myself. Let me structure it properly.\n\nEach bird in F2 is a combination of Cc and Bb. So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (if both parents contribute C)\n- Cc (if one parent contributes C and the other contributes c)\n- Bb (if both parents contribute B)\n- BB (if both contribute B)\n\nBut wait, each parent is Cc Bb, so all F2 individuals will be Cc Bb, right? Or am I misunderstanding the cross?\n\nNo, the cross is between Cc Bb and Cc Bb. So each parent produces gametes Cc and Bb with equal probability.\n\nSo each F2 individual will receive either Cc or Bb from each parent, leading to four possible combinations:\n\n1. Cc from first parent and Cc from second parent: Cc x Cc \u2192 CC, Cc, Cc, cc.\n2. Cc x Bb: Cc x Bb \u2192 Cc, Cc, Bb, Bb.\n3. Bb x Cc: same as above.\n4. Bb x Bb: Bb x Bb \u2192 BB, Bb, Bb, bb.\n\nThen, when combined, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the probabilities directly.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the probability of each genotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor eye color (B/b):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nHowever, when considering both traits together, the phenotypic ratios come from the combination of these probabilities.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we can multiply the probabilities of each trait occurring together.\n\nBut since both traits are influenced independently, the total phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a grid of all possible combinations and count the phenotypes.\n\nLet's outline all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n10. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n11. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n12. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, no\u2014each F2 individual is Cc Bb, so each can be:\n\n- CC (if both parents contributed C and C)\n- Cc (if one parent contributed C and the other c)\n- Bb (if one parent contributed B and the other b)\n- BB (if both parents contributed B and B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent contributes either Cc or Bb. So F2 individuals can be:\n\n- Cc (from Cc x Cc)\n- Cc (from Cc x Bb)\n- Cc (from Bb x Cc)\n- Bb (from Bb x Bb)\n\nAdditionally, some F2 individuals may have both Cc and Bb, such as from Cc x Bb, which combines to Cc Bb.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the Punnett square method.\n\nThe Punnett square for Cc Bb x Cc Bb:\n\n          | Cc | Bb\n        -----------------\n        Cc      | CC | Cc\n        Bb       | Cc | Bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: from Cc x Cc\n- Cc: from Cc x Bb and Bb x Cc\n- Bb: from Bb x Bb\n\nNow, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C from both parents and C from both parents) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (has C from one parent and c from another) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Bb (has B from one parent and b from another) \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb (no B and no b) \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird's genotype determines its phenotype based on both traits.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (because both C and B)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (only B)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain brown (only B)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (only C)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (both C and B)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (only C)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), Cc BB (2), Cc BB (3), Cc BB (4)? Wait, no\u2014let me recount.\n\nWait, no\u2014each F2 individual has a unique genotype. So from the Punnett square, the genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n8.

    "rollout": " It's about a dihybrid cross involving four different traits\u2014gene combinations like CcBB, etc.\u2014and I need to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Let me start by breaking down what each part means.\n\nFirst, the parents are CCBB (a homozygous checkered red bird) and ccbb (a plain brown bird). From this, their offspring will be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele from each gene pair. So the F1 generation should all be CcBb birds. Now, these F1 birds are going to self-fertilize to produce F2.\n\nThe next thing is understanding the genotypes and how they translate into phenotypes based on the given genes. Gene C determines checkered vs plain, and it's a dominant trait, meaning C shows as checkered regardless of other alleles. Gene B affects color: B is dominant for red and recessive for brown. Similarly, gene b makes brown, and b is dominant for brown, while B is dominant for red.\n\nSo let's outline the possible gametes each parent can make:\n\nFor CCBB:\n- Parent A: Can only give C and B since both are dominant. So gametes are CB.\n\nFor ccbb:\n- Parent B: Can only give c and b since both are recessive. So gametes are cb.\n\nWhen these combine, the F1 would get Cc (from Parent A) and Bb (from Parent B), making CcBb. But wait, when you have two genes, the gametes combine independently, but in this case, each parent gives only one type of gamete because their genotype is homozygous. So F1 is all CcBb.\n\nNow, for F2, we'll look at the F1 birds crossing over again. Each F1 individual has the genotype CcBb. When they self-pollinate, the possible gametes each F1 can produce are:\n\nFrom Cc:\n- C (homozygous dominant)\n- c (heterozygous recessive)\n\nFrom Bb:\n- B (heterozygote)\n- b (homozygous recessive)\n\nSo combining these, the possible gametes for each F1 bird are:\n\n- CB\n- Cb\n- cB\n- cb\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these gametes. That gives us 4 x 4 = 16 possible genotypic combinations.\n\nBut wait, some of these might not even form because of independent assortment. However, since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, which is typical for two loci with independent assortment.\n\nWait no, actually, since both parents are homozygous for each gene, the F1s are all heterozygotes for each gene. So when they self, each gene segregates independently. Therefore, the F2 will show a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene, but since the traits are linked or separate, we need to consider if the genes assort independently here.\n\nLooking back at the problem, the genes are on different chromosomes, I assume, so they assort independently. Therefore, each gene's segregation is independent of the others.\n\nLet me think about how the phenotypes would look. Each bird has two genes: one for checkered vs plain (C/c) and another for color (B/b).\n\nFor the phenotype of checkered vs plain, regardless of B/b, it's checkered. For color, it depends on B/B (red) or bb (brown). So each bird will have either checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, or plain brown.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, let's calculate how many of each genotype appear in the F2.\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb. They will produce gametes that are a combination of their Cc and Bb. Wait, no\u2014the correct way is to consider each gene separately.\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n- In F1 (Cc), they can produce C or c.\n- In F1 (Cc), same as above.\n\nFor the second gene (B/b):\n- In F1 (Bb), they can produce B or b.\n\nSince the F1 are all CcBb, when they self, each gene segregates independently. So each gene has a 50% chance of passing on C or c, and 50% chance of passing on B or b.\n\nThus, for each gene, there are four possibilities:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 CcBb \u2192 checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 checkered brown\n3. c and B \u2192 ccBB \u2192 plain red\n4. c and b \u2192 ccbb \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach of these outcomes occurs with equal probability since each gene segregates independently and each allele has an equal chance of being passed on.\n\nThere are 4 possibilities, each equally likely, so the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, meaning 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, and 25% plain brown.\n\nWait, but looking at the answer options, none seem to reflect 1:1:1:1. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the interaction between the two genes, leading to more specific phenotypes. Maybe the phenotypes aren't just based on the two genes independently, but combined.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and plain by c. The color is determined by B and b. So each bird has a phenotype determined by both genes.\n\nSo for example, a bird could be checkered red (CC BB), checkered brown (CC bb), plain red (cc BB), or plain brown (cc bb).\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird can be any combination of the four phenotypes, each with a certain frequency.\n\nSince each gene segregates independently, the probability of each phenotype is (1/2 * 1/2) for each combination.\n\nSo each of the four phenotypes appears 1/4 of the time. Thus, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, i.e., 25% each.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices provided, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match my calculation. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, those numbers add up to 16, which matches the total number of F2 individuals (since 4x4=16).\n\nWait, but according to my earlier reasoning, each phenotype should occur 1/4 of the time. So 16 birds would mean 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, and 4 plain brown. But none of the answer choices match that exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the phenotypes are determined differently because the dominance interactions change the outcome.\n\nWait, let me double-check the problem statement.\n\nThe checkered pattern is C, plain is c. Red is B, brown is b. So each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo a bird is checkered red if it has at least one C and at least one B (since C controls the pattern and B controls color). Checkered brown would require C and b (so pattern is checkered, color is brown). Plain red requires c and B, and plain brown requires c and b.\n\nWait, but that changes things. Because now, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene affects whether the other gene is expressed.\n\nSo for example, a bird with C and B would express both C and B, resulting in checkered red. A bird with C and b would express C and b, resulting in checkered brown. A bird with c and B would express c and B, resulting in plain red. And c and b would result in plain brown.\n\nSo each bird has four possible phenotypes, depending on their combination of alleles.\n\nGiven that, the Punnett square approach is needed to determine the distribution.\n\nSince each parent is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, their F1 would be CcBb. Then, when they self, the F2 will have a certain distribution.\n\nBut considering the interaction of the two genes, the Punnett square would involve each gene separately.\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n\nEach parent contributes C or c with 50% chance.\n\nFor the second gene (B/b):\n\nEach parent contributes B or b with 50% chance.\n\nSo the possible combinations for each gene are:\n\nGene 1: C and c\nGene 2: B and b\n\nWhich leads to four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 checkered brown\n3. c and B \u2192 plain red\n4. c and b \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach of these combinations occurs with a probability of 1/2 (for Gene 1) multiplied by 1/2 (for Gene 2) = 1/4 per phenotype.\n\nTherefore, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time in the F2 generation.\n\nWith 16 birds in F2, that would be 4 of each phenotype.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly say 4 each. The closest option is H, which says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that adds up to 16, but the proportions don't match our expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the genes as being linked, affecting the actual ratios.\n\nIf the genes are linked, then some phenotypes may have higher or lower frequencies than expected under independent assortment.\n\nBut without information about linkage, I'll proceed with the assumption that the genes assort independently.\n\nGiven that, each phenotype should have 25% occurrence.\n\nBut the options don't include 4 each. Therefore, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about the F2 ratio but something else, like the F1 phenotypes or something else. No, the question clearly asks for the F2 generation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should re-examine the answer choices.\n\nOption J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Totaling 12, which is less than 16. Doesn't make sense.\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16, but the ratios don't align with our expectation.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, 16 total, but incorrect proportions.\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. That seems off.\n\nOption B: 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown. Not matching.\n\nOption C: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. That sums to 16, but the ratios don't fit.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. That's 16, but the proportion is wrong.\n\nOption F: All 4 each. But none of the options say 4 each.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming independent assortment. If the genes are linked, the phenotypic ratios would deviate.\n\nSuppose the two genes are linked such that the B allele is on one chromosome and b is on the other, but I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact linkage, I can't compute the exact ratios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach, such as counting the possible combinations without relying on independent assortment.\n\nWait, for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B (checkered, red)\n- Checkered brown: C and b (checkered, brown)\n- Plain red: c and B (plain, red)\n- Plain brown: c and b (plain, brown)\n\nEach of these is 1/4 chance.\n\nSo in F2, 4 birds would be each phenotype.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect 4 each.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation instead of F2? Or maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, the problem says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nSo yes, F2.\n\nBut according to standard Mendelian inheritance with independent assortment, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time. Therefore, in 16 birds, 4 of each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the options, none have 4 each. So perhaps the intended answer is based on a different consideration, such as dominance interactions altering the expected ratios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the presence of both dominant alleles results in one phenotype, overriding the recessive ones.\n\nWait, no, the problem explicitly states that checkered is determined by C and plain by c, and red by B and brown by b. So each gene's expression overrides the other.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratios should be 4 each. Since none of the options reflect that, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than F2, but the initial cross was between CCBB and ccbb, which produces F1 as CcBb, and F2 would be the next generation after that.\n\nBut even so, in F2, each gene segregates independently, leading to 4 each.\n\nWait, maybe the options are scaled incorrectly, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different system where the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective phenotype, but that's already considered.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question counts the number of possible genotypes instead of the number of birds, but the problem specifies the number of birds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as using Punnett squares without considering independent assortment.\n\nWait, maybe I should recalculate the possible genotypes and phenotypes correctly.\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb. So when they self, each gene segregates independently.\n\nGene 1 (C/c): C or c\n\nGene 2 (B/b): B or b\n\nPossible gametes:\n\n- C and B\n- C and b\n- c and B\n- c and b\n\nSo the F2 will have:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc = 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb = 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (checkered red)\n- CC Bb (checkered brown)\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nPlus the combinations with only one gene expressing:\n\n- CC Bb (checkered brown)\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- CC bb (checkered brown)\n- cc bb (plain brown)\n\nWait, but some of these are duplicates. Specifically:\n\n- CC BB is the only one with both dominant alleles.\n- CC Bb has at least one dominant allele, so it's checkered.\n- cc BB has at least one recessive allele, so it's plain.\n- cc bb also has at least one recessive, so plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nThus, each bird is classified as:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC and BB)\n2. Checkered brown (CC and Bb)\n3. Plain red (cc and BB)\n4. Plain brown (cc and Bb)\n\nEach of these occurs with equal probability (25%), leading to 4 each in 16 birds.\n\nBut since none of the answer options reflect 4 each, perhaps the intended answer is based on another approach or a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2, but the initial cross is between CCBB and ccbb, which would produce F1 as CcBb, and F2 would be from that cross.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is that each phenotype should occur 25%, leading to 4 each in F2.\n\nSince none of the options match, perhaps the best choice is option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But that adds up to 16, yet the ratios don't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of B dominates over b, so even if both genes are present, it's still red. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only one gene influencing the phenotype, but the question mentions two genes.\n\nPerhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the dominance hierarchy and consider each phenotype as a combination of both genes' expressions.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct ratios should be 4 each, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach, possibly missing some details or having a different interpretation.\n\nBut given the options, none perfectly match 4 each. So perhaps the closest is option E, which has 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the F1 generation instead of F2, which would lead to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, the initial cross is between CCBB (which is checkered red) and ccbb (which is plain brown). The F1 would be CcBb, which is all checkered birds. Their own self would produce an F2 generation following a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nSo in F2:\n\n- 9: 3: 3: 1\n\nCheckered red: 9 birds\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain red: 3\nPlain brown: 1\n\nAdding up to 16.\n\nThis matches option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 equals 16. None of the options have 9, 3, 3, 1 except for option H, which says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16 but the ratios don't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the F1 as the base and expecting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the F1 to be counted as F2, but that doesn't make sense because F1 is the first generation.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer based on independent assortment and equal likelihood",

It's about a dihybrid cross involving four different traits\u2014gene combinations like CcBB, etc.\u2014and I need to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Let me start by breaking down what each part means.\n\nFirst, the parents are CCBB (a homozygous checkered red bird) and ccbb (a plain brown bird).

That gives us 4 x 4 = 16 possible genotypic combinations.\n\nBut wait, some of these might not even form because of independent assortment. However, since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, which is typical for two loci with independent assortment.\n\nWait no, actually, since both parents are homozygous for each gene, the F1s are all heterozygotes for each gene.

So each bird will have either checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, or plain brown.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, let's calculate how many of each genotype appear in the F2.\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb. They will produce gametes that are a combination of their Cc and Bb. Wait, no\u2014the correct way is to consider each gene separately.\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n- In F1 (Cc), they can produce C or c.\n- In F1 (Cc), same as above.\n\nFor the second gene (B/b):\n- In F1 (Bb), they can produce B or b.\n\nSince the F1 are all CcBb, when they self, each gene segregates independently.

Thus, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, i.e., 25% each.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices provided, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match my calculation. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, those numbers add up to 16, which matches the total number of F2 individuals (since 4x4=16).\n\nWait, but according to my earlier reasoning, each phenotype should occur 1/4 of the time.

That totals 16, but the ratios don't align with our expectation.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, 16 total, but incorrect proportions.\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. That seems off.\n\nOption B: 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown. Not matching.\n\nOption C: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. That sums to 16, but the ratios don't fit.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. That's 16, but the proportion is wrong.\n\nOption F: All 4 each. But none of the options say 4 each.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming independent assortment. If the genes are linked, the phenotypic ratios would deviate.\n\nSuppose the two genes are linked such that the B allele is on one chromosome and b is on the other, but I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact linkage, I can't compute the exact ratios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach, such as counting the possible combinations without relying on independent assortment.\n\nWait, for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B (checkered, red)\n- Checkered brown: C and b (checkered, brown)\n- Plain red: c and B (plain, red)\n- Plain brown: c and b (plain, brown)\n\nEach of these is 1/4 chance.\n\nSo in F2, 4 birds would be each phenotype.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect 4 each.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation instead of F2? Or maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, the problem says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nSo yes, F2.\n\nBut according to standard Mendelian inheritance with independent assortment, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time. Therefore, in 16 birds, 4 of each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the options, none have 4 each. So perhaps the intended answer is based on a different consideration, such as dominance interactions altering the expected ratios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the presence of both dominant alleles results in one phenotype, overriding the recessive ones.\n\nWait, no, the problem explicitly states that checkered is determined by C and plain by c, and red by B and brown by b. So each gene's expression overrides the other.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratios should be 4 each. Since none of the options reflect that, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than F2, but the initial cross was between CCBB and ccbb, which produces F1 as CcBb, and F2 would be the next generation after that.\n\nBut even so, in F2, each gene segregates independently, leading to 4 each.\n\nWait, maybe the options are scaled incorrectly, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different system where the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective phenotype, but that's already considered.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question counts the number of possible genotypes instead of the number of birds, but the problem specifies the number of birds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as using Punnett squares without considering independent assortment.\n\nWait, maybe I should recalculate the possible genotypes and phenotypes correctly.\n\nEach F1 bird is CcBb. So when they self, each gene segregates independently.\n\nGene 1 (C/c): C or c\n\nGene 2 (B/b): B or b\n\nPossible gametes:\n\n- C and B\n- C and b\n- c and B\n- c and b\n\nSo the F2 will have:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc = 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb = 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (checkered red)\n- CC Bb (checkered brown)\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nPlus the combinations with only one gene expressing:\n\n- CC Bb (checkered brown)\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- CC bb (checkered brown)\n- cc bb (plain brown)\n\nWait, but some of these are duplicates. Specifically:\n\n- CC BB is the only one with both dominant alleles.\n- CC Bb has at least one dominant allele, so it's checkered.\n- cc BB has at least one recessive allele, so it's plain.\n- cc bb also has at least one recessive, so plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nThus, each bird is classified as:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC and BB)\n2. Checkered brown (CC and Bb)\n3. Plain red (cc and BB)\n4. Plain brown (cc and Bb)\n\nEach of these occurs with equal probability (25%), leading to 4 each in 16 birds.\n\nBut since none of the answer options reflect 4 each, perhaps the intended answer is based on another approach or a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, not F2, but the initial cross is between CCBB and ccbb, which would produce F1 as CcBb, and F2 would be from that cross.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is that each phenotype should occur 25%, leading to 4 each in F2.\n\nSince none of the options match, perhaps the best choice is option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But that adds up to 16, yet the ratios don't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of B dominates over b, so even if both genes are present, it's still red. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only one gene influencing the phenotype, but the question mentions two genes.\n\nPerhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the dominance hierarchy and consider each phenotype as a combination of both genes' expressions.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct ratios should be 4 each, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different approach, possibly missing some details or having a different interpretation.\n\nBut given the options, none perfectly match 4 each. So perhaps the closest is option E, which has 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the F1 generation instead of F2, which would lead to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, the initial cross is between CCBB (which is checkered red) and ccbb (which is plain brown). The F1 would be CcBb, which is all checkered birds. Their own self would produce an F2 generation following a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nSo in F2:\n\n- 9: 3: 3: 1\n\nCheckered red: 9 birds\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain red: 3\nPlain brown: 1\n\nAdding up to 16.\n\nThis matches option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, no, 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 equals 16. None of the options have 9, 3, 3, 1 except for option H, which says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16 but the ratios don't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the F1 as the base and expecting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the F1 to be counted as F2, but that doesn't make sense because F1 is the first generation.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer based on independent assortment and equal likelihood",

    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C. That means if someone has at least one C allele, they'll have the checkered pattern. The other trait is about color\u2014red and brown. Red is controlled by a dominant gene B, so if you have at least one B, it'll be red. Brown is recessive, meaning you need two b alleles to get brown.\n\nThere are two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which would be CC (since C is dominant). Wait, no\u2014if it's homozygous, both alleles are the same. So if it's CC, that would give them the checkered pattern because the dominant C will express. But wait, let me think again. Homozygous checkered red would mean both alleles are C? No, actually, in terms of dominance, if C is dominant, then having CC or Cc would result in the checkered pattern because the dominant allele C masks the recessive c. So a homozygous checkered red bird would be CC, right?\n\nThen there's another bird: a plain brown bird. Since brown is recessive, that bird must be bb because they're homozygous. So their genotype is bb for the brown allele.\n\nNow, we're doing an adihybrid cross between these two birds. Adihybrid refers to a cross between two heterozygotes, but here the first bird is homozygous, so maybe it's just a regular cross.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the question says \"adahybridcross,\" which might be a typo. It should probably be dihybrid cross, but I'll proceed as given.\n\nSo, the parents are CC (checkered red) and bb (plain brown).\n\nWhen crossed, the possible gametes from CC are all C (since it's homozygous), and from bb, all b (homozygous recessive). So the F1 generation would consist of all combinations of C and b: Cb. So each F1 bird would be Cb, meaning they'd show the checkered pattern and have brown eyes perhaps? Wait, no, the B and b are about eye color, not pattern. The pattern is determined by C and c. So C is dominant, so any C allele makes them checkered. So F1 would all be Cb, which means checkered pattern and brown eyes.\n\nBut wait, the second bird is plain brown, meaning bb, and the first is CC, so all F1 would be Cb, which is checkered and brown. So all F1 would be Cb, expressing the checkered pattern and brown eyes.\n\nNext, the F1 would self-pollinate to produce F2. So each parent (F1) can produce two types of gametes: C and b. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\nCC \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Cb,\nCc \u00d7 cb \u2192 all Cb,\ncc \u00d7 cc \u2192 all cc.\n\nWait, no, the parents are F1, so each F1 bird is Cb. So when they mate, each can produce either C or b gametes. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Cb,\n- Cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 all Cb,\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 all cc.\n\nSo F2 consists of four genotypes:\n- 25% CC,\n- 50% Cc,\n- 25% cc.\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered pattern, since C is dominant.\n- Cc: Also Checkered pattern, because C is dominant over c.\n- cc: Plain brown, since c is recessive and B is dominant.\n\nWait, but in the cross described earlier, the F1 was Cb, meaning checkered and brown. Then F2 would be based on the F1 genotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014the cross is F1 \u00d7 F1. Each F1 bird is Cb, so each can produce C and b gametes. So all F2 would be Cb \u00d7 Cb, leading to Cc and cc genotypes.\n\nSo F2 genotypes would be:\n- CC: 25% (from C \u00d7 C),\n- Cc: 50% (from C \u00d7 c + c \u00d7 C),\n- cc: 25% (from c \u00d7 c).\n\nPhenotypically:\n- CC and Cc will be Checkered, because they have at least one C allele.\n- cc will be Plain brown.\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation assuming a large population (like 100 birds):\n\n- 25% Checkered = 25 birds,\n- 25% Plain brown = 25 birds.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't include 25 and 25. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. For example, option G says 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., but none seem to match exactly 25 and 25. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents were misinterpreted. Let me re-examine the original question.\n\nWait, the initial question said: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So the first bird is CC (since it's homozygous and red), and the second is bb (since it's plain brown). Their cross would be CC \u00d7 bb, resulting in Cb.\n\nSo the F1 would all be Cb, which is Checkered and Brown.\n\nThen F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2 as I thought before, with 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nThus, F2 would be:\n\n- 25% Checkered (since CC and Cc both express Checkered)\n- 25% Plain brown (since cc expresses plain brown)\n\nSo the ratio would be 1:1 between Checkered and Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 1:1. However, looking closer, option J states a checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't fit my expectation. Option E is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\u2014which also seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the cross. Alternatively, maybe the parents were not CC \u00d7 bb, but something else. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, the parents are described correctly: CC (homozygous checkered red) and bb (homozygous plain brown). So their cross is correct.\n\nAnother possibility is that the F1 individuals are considered as separate from the F2, but that shouldn't affect the ratios.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the issue is that the cross is supposed to involve dihybrid crosses instead of monohybrid. But the question specifies dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nAh, \"adahybridcross\"\u2014probably a typo for \"dihybrid cross.\" So, yes, the parents are CC \u00d7 bb.\n\nSo the F2 would indeed be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSo checking the options, none seem to match 25-25. But looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me verify.\n\nIn the F2, 25% CC and 25% cc would be Checkered, and 50% Cc would be Checkered too. So all three genotypes would express Checkered except for cc, which is Plain brown. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1:0? Wait, no\u2014it's 25% Checkered and 25% Plain brown.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1 for Checkered vs Plain brown.\n\nBut the options don't reflect that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are different. Let me reconsider the parents.\n\nWait, the first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which would be CC (since C is dominant). The second bird is a plain brown bird, which is bb (since B is dominant for red, and brown is recessive).\n\nSo their cross is CC \u00d7 bb, resulting in all Cb.\n\nThen F1 is all Cb, so their F2 would be:\n\nEach F1 bird (Cb) can produce C and b gametes. So F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- C \u00d7 C \u2192 CC (25%),\n- C \u00d7 b \u2192 Cb (50%),\n- b \u00d7 b \u2192 bb (25%).\n\nThus, F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CC and Cb \u2192 Checkered,\n- bb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSo the ratio is 25% Checkered and 25% Plain brown, which translates to 1:1.\n\nAgain, the options don't match this exactly. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This adds up to 12 birds, which isn't matching 25:25.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Again, total is 16.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3\u219216 birds, adding to 16. Not matching.\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. Total 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4\u219216. Not matching.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match 1:1. Did I make a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not CC \u00d7 bb, but something else. Let me consider if the parents are different. Suppose the first bird is a heterozygote, like Cc, but the description says homozygous checkered red, so CC.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are different. If the first bird is Cc (heterozygous), and the second is bb, then the cross would be different. But according to the question, the first bird is homozygous, so CC.\n\nWait, unless there's a misunderstanding in the terminology. The first bird is homozygous checkered red, which would imply CC, as red is dominant. The second bird is plain brown, which would be bb.\n\nSo the cross is correct.\n\nGiven that, the F2 would have 25% Checkered and 25% Plain brown, but none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This sums to 16, but the ratios don't align.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sums to 16.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sums to 16.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sums to 16.\n\nNone of these options have a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, maybe the parents are not CC \u00d7 bb, but rather Cc \u00d7 bb. Because sometimes, even if it's homozygous, it could be a heterozygote due to a mutation or error.\n\nIf the first bird is Cc (heterozygous) and the second is bb, then the cross would be Cc \u00d7 bb. In that case, the F1 would be Cb and bc. The F2 would then have:\n\n- C \u00d7 C \u2192 CC (25%),\n- C \u00d7 b \u2192 Cb (50%),\n- b \u00d7 C \u2192 bc (50%),\n- b \u00d7 b \u2192 bb (25%).\n\nSo F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25% Checkered),\n- Cb (50% Checkered),\n- bc (50% Plain brown),\n- bb (25% Plain brown).\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC and Cb \u2192 Checkered,\n- bc and bb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 50% Checkered and 50% Plain brown. Now, looking at the options, none have 1:1. So perhaps this is the intended path.\n\nIn this scenario, the F2 would have 100 birds with 50% Checkered and 50% Plain brown. But the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are actually Cc \u00d7 Cc, making a dihybrid cross, but the question says a dihybrid cross. No, the question specifically mentions a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, the user mentioned a dihybrid cross, but the parents are given as CC \u00d7 bb, which would be a monohybrid cross, not dihybrid. Maybe that's where the confusion lies.\n\nPerhaps the user meant a dihybrid cross, but the parents are given incorrectly. Or perhaps the parents are actually Cc \u00d7 Cc, making a dihybrid cross. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf the parents are Cc \u00d7 Cc (dihybrid), then the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC,\n- 50% Cc,\n- 25% cc.\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- 25% Checkered (since CC and Cc both express Checkered),\n- 25% Plain brown (cc).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1. None of the options match this, though.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where the parents are both Cc (heterozygous), making a dihybrid cross. So each parent contributes a C or a c allele. The F2 would have the same 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered (25%),\n- Plain brown (25%).\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:1. Again, the options don't match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question uses the wrong term for dihybrid cross, thinking it's a dihybrid cross when it's actually a monohybrid cross. But the question clearly states a dihybrid cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are different. Let me consider if the first bird is Cc (heterozygous) and the second is Cc as well, making a dihybrid cross. Then, F2 would be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Which gives the same ratio as above.\n\nStill, the options don't match. Maybe I need to look for the closest option.\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This totals 16 birds. It suggests that 25% are Checkered, 25% are Plain brown. But in reality, it's 50-50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are Cc \u00d7 Cc, and the cross is done correctly, leading to 1:1 phenotypic ratio. But the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the parents. If the first bird is Cc and the second is bb, then the cross would be Cc \u00d7 bb, leading to:\n\n- Cb (50%),\n- bc (50%).\n\nSo F2:\n\n- Cb \u2192 Checkered,\n- bc \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nThus, 50% Checkered, 50% Plain brown.\n\nBut the options don't have this either.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered pattern affects the color. Let me clarify:\n\nRed is dominant (R), brown is recessive (r). Checkered pattern is determined by a dominant allele, say C.\n\nSo, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's Checkered and red. If it's Cc or CC, it's Checkered and red. If it's cc, it's plain brown. So, the presence of C determines Checkered, regardless of whether it's red or brown.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories are based on whether the bird has at least one C allele. So:\n\n- Any C \u2192 Checkered (dominant),\n- Any cc \u2192 Plain brown (recessive).\n\nSo, in the F2 cross, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of C. Therefore, the 50% Checkered and 50% Plain brown ratio holds.\n\nBut since none of the options reflect this, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of Checkered red to others, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: it asks about the phenotypes, genotypes, and ratios for F2. The options suggest specific numbers, likely derived from a 1:1 ratio, but the calculations indicate otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are actually Cc \u00d7 Cc, making a dihybrid cross, but the question describes a dihybrid cross. But without further information, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but that doesn't fit either. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J, but that's 1:1, which is not reflected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is expressed as both colors, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the actual counts based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nIf the first bird is CC (homozygous checkered red) and the second is bb (homozygous plain brown), then their cross is CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Cb.\n\nThus, F1 is all Cb, which is Checkered and brown.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 \u2192 each can produce C and b gametes. So F2 genotypes:\n\n- C \u00d7 C \u2192 CC (25%),\n- C \u00d7 b \u2192 Cb (50%),\n- b \u00d7 C \u2192 bc (50%),\n- b \u00d7 b \u2192 bb (25%).\n\nThus, F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CC and Cb \u2192 Checkered,\n- bc and bb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSo, the ratio would be 25% Checkered and 25% Plain brown, totaling 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1, but none of the options match this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves a checkered pattern of pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C. That means if someone has at least one C allele, they'll have the checkered pattern. The other trait is about color\u2014red and brown. Red is controlled by a dominant gene B, so if you have at least one B, it'll be red. Brown is recessive, meaning you need two b alleles to get brown.\n\nThere are two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which would be CC (since C is dominant). Wait, no\u2014if it's homozygous, both alleles are the same. So if it's CC, that would give them the checkered pattern because the dominant C will express. But wait, let me think again. Homozygous checkered red would mean both alleles are C? No, actually, in terms of dominance, if C is dominant, then having CC or Cc would result in the checkered pattern because the dominant allele C masks the recessive c. So a homozygous checkered red bird would be CC, right?\n\nThen there's another bird: a plain brown bird. Since brown is recessive, that bird must be bb because they're homozygous. So their genotype is bb for the brown allele.\n\nNow, we're doing an adihybrid cross between these two birds. Adihybrid refers to a cross between two heterozygotes, but here the first bird is homozygous, so maybe it's just a regular cross.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the question says \"adahybridcross,\" which might be a typo. It should probably be dihybrid cross, but I'll proceed as given.\n\nSo, the parents are CC (checkered red) and bb (plain brown).\n\nWhen crossed, the possible gametes from CC are all C (since it's homozygous), and from bb, all b (homozygous recessive). So the F1 generation would consist of all combinations of C and b: Cb. So each F1 bird would be Cb, meaning they'd show the checkered pattern and have brown eyes perhaps? Wait, no, the B and b are about eye color, not pattern. The pattern is determined by C and c. So C is dominant, so any C allele makes them checkered. So F1 would all be Cb, which means checkered pattern and brown eyes.\n\nBut wait, the second bird is plain brown, meaning bb, and the first is CC, so all F1 would be Cb, which is checkered and brown. So all F1 would be Cb, expressing the checkered pattern and brown eyes.\n\nNext, the F1 would self-pollinate to produce F2. So each parent (F1) can produce two types of gametes: C and b. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\nCC \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Cb,\nCc \u00d7 cb \u2192 all Cb,\ncc \u00d7 cc \u2192 all cc.\n\nWait, no, the parents are F1, so each F1 bird is Cb. So when they mate, each can produce either C or b gametes. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Cb,\n- Cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 all Cb,\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 all cc.\n\nSo F2 consists of four genotypes:\n- 25% CC,\n- 50% Cc,\n- 25% cc.\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered pattern, since C is dominant.\n- Cc: Also Checkered pattern, because C is dominant over c.\n- cc: Plain brown, since c is recessive and B is dominant.\n\nWait, but in the cross described earlier, the F1 was Cb, meaning checkered and brown. Then F2 would be based on the F1 genotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014the cross is F1 \u00d7 F1. Each F1 bird is Cb, so each can produce C and b gametes. So all F2 would be Cb \u00d7 Cb, leading to Cc and cc genotypes.\n\nSo F2 genotypes would be:\n- CC: 25% (from C \u00d7 C),\n- Cc: 50% (from C \u00d7 c + c \u00d7 C),\n- cc: 25% (from c \u00d7 c).\n\nPhenotypically:\n- CC and Cc will be Checkered, because they have at least one C allele.\n- cc will be Plain brown.\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation assuming a large population (like 100 birds):\n\n- 25% Checkered = 25 birds,\n- 25% Plain brown = 25 birds.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't include 25 and 25. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. For example, option G says 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., but none seem to match exactly 25 and 25. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents were misinterpreted. Let me re-examine the original question.\n\nWait, the initial question said: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So the first bird is CC (since it's homozygous and red), and the second is bb (since it's plain brown). Their cross would be CC \u00d7 bb, resulting in Cb.\n\nSo the F1 would all be Cb, which is Checkered and Brown.\n\nThen F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2 as I thought before, with 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nThus, F2 would be:\n\n- 25% Checkered (since CC and Cc both express Checkered)\n- 25% Plain brown (since cc expresses plain brown)\n\nSo the ratio would be 1:1 between Checkered and Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly say 1:1. However, looking closer, option J states a checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't fit my expectation. Option E is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\u2014which also seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the cross. Alternatively, maybe the parents were not CC \u00d7 bb, but something else. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, the parents are described correctly: CC (homozygous checkered red) and bb (homozygous plain brown). So their cross is correct.\n\nAnother possibility is that the F1 individuals are considered as separate from the F2, but that shouldn't affect the ratios.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the issue is that the cross is supposed to involve dihybrid crosses instead of monohybrid. But the question specifies dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Complete a Punnett square for adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nAh, \"adahybridcross\"\u2014probably a typo for \"dihybrid cross.\" So, yes, the parents are CC \u00d7 bb.\n\nSo the F2 would indeed be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSo checking the options, none seem to match 25-25. But looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me verify.\n\nIn the F2, 25% CC and 25% cc would be Checkered, and 50% Cc would be Checkered too. So all three genotypes would express Checkered except for cc, which is Plain brown. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1:0? Wait, no\u2014it's 25% Checkered and 25% Plain brown.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1 for Checkered vs Plain brown.\n\nBut the options don't reflect that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are different. Let me reconsider the parents.\n\nWait, the first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which would be CC (since C is dominant). The second bird is a plain brown bird, which is bb (since B is dominant for red, and brown is recessive).\n\nSo their cross is CC \u00d7 bb, resulting in all Cb.\n\nThen F1 is all Cb, so their F2 would be:\n\nEach F1 bird (Cb) can produce C and b gametes. So F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- C \u00d7 C \u2192 CC (25%),\n- C \u00d7 b \u2192 Cb (50%),\n- b \u00d7 b \u2192 bb (25%).\n\nThus, F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CC and Cb \u2192 Checkered,\n- bb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSo the ratio is 25% Checkered and 25% Plain brown, which translates to 1:1.\n\nAgain, the options don't match this exactly. Let me see the options again.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This adds up to 12 birds, which isn't matching 25:25.\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Again, total is 16.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3\u219216 birds, adding to 16. Not matching.\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. Total 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4\u219216. Not matching.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match 1:1. Did I make a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not CC \u00d7 bb, but something else. Let me consider if the parents are different. Suppose the first bird is a heterozygote, like Cc, but the description says homozygous checkered red, so CC.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are different. If the first bird is Cc (heterozygous), and the second is bb, then the cross would be different. But according to the question, the first bird is homozygous, so CC.\n\nWait, unless there's a misunderstanding in the terminology. The first bird is homozygous checkered red, which would imply CC, as red is dominant. The second bird is plain brown, which would be bb.\n\nSo the cross is correct.\n\nGiven that, the F2 would have 25% Checkered and 25% Plain brown, but none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This sums to 16, but the ratios don't align.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sums to 16.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sums to 16.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sums to 16.\n\nNone of these options have a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, maybe the parents are not CC \u00d7 bb, but rather Cc \u00d7 bb. Because sometimes, even if it's homozygous, it could be a heterozygote due to a mutation or error.\n\nIf the first bird is Cc (heterozygous) and the second is bb, then the cross would be Cc \u00d7 bb. In that case, the F1 would be Cb and bc. The F2 would then have:\n\n- C \u00d7 C \u2192 CC (25%),\n- C \u00d7 b \u2192 Cb (50%),\n- b \u00d7 C \u2192 bc (50%),\n- b \u00d7 b \u2192 bb (25%).\n\nSo F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (25% Checkered),\n- Cb (50% Checkered),\n- bc (50% Plain brown),\n- bb (25% Plain brown).\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC and Cb \u2192 Checkered,\n- bc and bb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 50% Checkered and 50% Plain brown. Now, looking at the options, none have 1:1. So perhaps this is the intended path.\n\nIn this scenario, the F2 would have 100 birds with 50% Checkered and 50% Plain brown. But the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are actually Cc \u00d7 Cc, making a dihybrid cross, but the question says a dihybrid cross. No, the question specifically mentions a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, the user mentioned a dihybrid cross, but the parents are given as CC \u00d7 bb, which would be a monohybrid cross, not dihybrid. Maybe that's where the confusion lies.\n\nPerhaps the user meant a dihybrid cross, but the parents are given incorrectly. Or perhaps the parents are actually Cc \u00d7 Cc, making a dihybrid cross. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf the parents are Cc \u00d7 Cc (dihybrid), then the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC,\n- 50% Cc,\n- 25% cc.\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- 25% Checkered (since CC and Cc both express Checkered),\n- 25% Plain brown (cc).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1. None of the options match this, though.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where the parents are both Cc (heterozygous), making a dihybrid cross. So each parent contributes a C or a c allele. The F2 would have the same 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered (25%),\n- Plain brown (25%).\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:1. Again, the options don't match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question uses the wrong term for dihybrid cross, thinking it's a dihybrid cross when it's actually a monohybrid cross. But the question clearly states a dihybrid cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are different. Let me consider if the first bird is Cc (heterozygous) and the second is Cc as well, making a dihybrid cross. Then, F2 would be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Which gives the same ratio as above.\n\nStill, the options don't match. Maybe I need to look for the closest option.\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This totals 16 birds. It suggests that 25% are Checkered, 25% are Plain brown. But in reality, it's 50-50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are Cc \u00d7 Cc, and the cross is done correctly, leading to 1:1 phenotypic ratio. But the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the parents. If the first bird is Cc and the second is bb, then the cross would be Cc \u00d7 bb, leading to:\n\n- Cb (50%),\n- bc (50%).\n\nSo F2:\n\n- Cb \u2192 Checkered,\n- bc \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nThus, 50% Checkered, 50% Plain brown.\n\nBut the options don't have this either.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered pattern affects the color. Let me clarify:\n\nRed is dominant (R), brown is recessive (r). Checkered pattern is determined by a dominant allele, say C.\n\nSo, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's Checkered and red. If it's Cc or CC, it's Checkered and red. If it's cc, it's plain brown. So, the presence of C determines Checkered, regardless of whether it's red or brown.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories are based on whether the bird has at least one C allele. So:\n\n- Any C \u2192 Checkered (dominant),\n- Any cc \u2192 Plain brown (recessive).\n\nSo, in the F2 cross, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of C. Therefore, the 50% Checkered and 50% Plain brown ratio holds.\n\nBut since none of the options reflect this, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of Checkered red to others, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: it asks about the phenotypes, genotypes, and ratios for F2. The options suggest specific numbers, likely derived from a 1:1 ratio, but the calculations indicate otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are actually Cc \u00d7 Cc, making a dihybrid cross, but the question describes a dihybrid cross. But without further information, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option G, but that doesn't fit either. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J, but that's 1:1, which is not reflected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is expressed as both colors, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the actual counts based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nIf the first bird is CC (homozygous checkered red) and the second is bb (homozygous plain brown), then their cross is CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Cb.\n\nThus, F1 is all Cb, which is Checkered and brown.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 \u2192 each can produce C and b gametes. So F2 genotypes:\n\n- C \u00d7 C \u2192 CC (25%),\n- C \u00d7 b \u2192 Cb (50%),\n- b \u00d7 C \u2192 bc (50%),\n- b \u00d7 b \u2192 bb (25%).\n\nThus, F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CC and Cb \u2192 Checkered,\n- bc and bb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSo, the ratio would be 25% Checkered and 25% Plain brown, totaling 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1, but none of the options match this.

    "chunk_resampled": "Let me break it down step by step.",
    "rollout": " Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a checkered red bird, which means they have the genotype CcBB because the dominant gene C produces the checkered pattern, and the dominant B gene gives them red color. Wait, no, actually, in the initial setup, the checkered pattern is dominant (C), so if a bird has at least one C allele, it's checkered. The other trait is plain color (c), which is recessive, so both parents must have at least one c allele to be plain. \n\nSo the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Checkered red (CC BB)\n- Parent 2: Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So parent 1 is CC BB, and parent 2 is cc bb. That makes sense.\n\nNow, we're looking at an A.Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two birds. But wait, the question isn't clear on what kind of cross it is\u2014checkered red and plain brown? Or maybe another type like dihybrid? Hmm, the way it's written might imply a dihybrid cross since there are two traits involved.\n\nBut let's read the question again carefully. It asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after considering the A.Punnett square from a checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So probably, each bird can produce gametes that combine to give F1 and then F2.\n\nWait, but in the user's message, they provided a table of gametes for F1 and F2. Let me look at that.\n\nThe gametes listed include CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but the user also showed the actual F1 and F2 generations, along with their expected phenotypes, genotypes, etc. Maybe that was part of the problem statement.\n\nLooking back, the problem says: Complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Then, show the phenotypic ratio, genotypes, etc., for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the user also presented an A.Punnett square gametes list, followed by the F1 and F2 generations. So perhaps the problem expects us to use those F2 results to determine the phenotypic ratio.\n\nIn the gamete list, the possible combinations are CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F1 would be CcBB (from CB x cb?), wait no, the F1 is when you cross a CC BB (homozygous) with cc bb (homozygous). So all offspring should be CcBB and ccbb, right?\n\nWait, no. If one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, then the F1 would be Cc BB (since the father is CC BB, mother is cc bb. So all gametes from father will be CB, and from mother will be cb. So F1 would be CcBB (from CB x cb?) No, wait, that doesn't make sense. The F1 would actually be CcBB and ccbb, but in reality, the gametes from the father are CB, and from the mother are cb. So the F1 would be CcBB and ccbb, but in terms of combinations, it would be:\n\nFrom father: CB \u2192 CcBB\nFrom mother: cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo combining, all offspring would be CcBB (from CB x cb?), but wait, that's not quite accurate. Actually, the F1 would be CcBB (from CB x cb) and ccbb (from cb x cb), but since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would just be CcBB and ccbb, but in terms of combination, the F1 would be CcBB (from CB * cb) and ccbb (from cb * cb). However, in terms of F1, each bird has two alleles, so the F1 would be CcBB and ccbb. But more accurately, each bird is heterozygous for both traits.\n\nWait, but the user already did the Punnett square and showed the F1 and F2. Let me focus on the F2 results, as the problem mentions F2.\n\nLooking at the gamete combinations, the F2 would result from F1 individuals crossing with each other. The F1 individuals are CcBB and ccbb. When crossed, the F2 generation would consist of four types: CcBB (from Cc * Cc), cB* (wait, no, let me correct that. The F1 is actually CcBB and ccbb. So the F2 would come from F1 x F1.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBB or ccbb. So when they mate, the possible gametes are:\n\nFor CcBB:\n- From Cc: C and c\n- From BB: B and B\nSo gametes are CB and cb.\n\nFor ccbb:\n- All gametes are cb.\n\nTherefore, the F2 would have the following possible combinations:\n\n1. CB (from Cc * CB) \u2192 CcBB (from CB * CB?)\nWait, no. Each F1 bird can produce either CB or cb gametes. So when F1 (CcBB) and F1 (ccbb) mate:\n\nThe gametes from F1 (CcBB): CB and cb.\nThe gametes from F1 (ccbb): cb.\n\nSo the F2 would consist of:\n\nCB (from CcBB) paired with cb (from ccbb) \u2192 CcBb\ncb (from CcBB) paired with cb (from ccbb) \u2192 ccbb\n\nAdditionally, the F1 (CcBB) itself can pair with itself:\n\nCcBB (from first F1) paired with CB (from second F1) \u2192 CcBB\nCcBB (first F1) paired with cb \u2192 Ccbb\nSimilarly, CcBB paired with cb \u2192 Ccbb\nAnd CcBB paired with cb \u2192 Ccbb\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, using the Punnett square approach, the F2 would have the following genotypic ratios based on the F1's genotypes.\n\nSince the F1 for each trait is Cc (for the dominant trait) and BB (but wait, BB is from the parent who is BB, so any bird that inherits BB will be BB regardless of the other trait. Similarly, cc is the other trait).\n\nWait, no. In the F1, each bird is Cc BB (since the father is CC BB and mother is cc bb, so F1 would be Cc BB and cc bb). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify.\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CC (parent 1):\n- C and C (so CC)\nFrom BB (parent 1):\n- B and B (so BB)\n\nFrom cc (parent 2):\n- c and c (so cc)\nFrom bb (parent 2):\n- b and b (so bb)\n\nSo the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CC * cc: Cc cc (all Cc)\nFrom CC * bb: Cc bb (all Cc)\nFrom BB * cc: Cc cc (all Cc)\nFrom BB * bb: Cc bb (all Cc)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you cross CC BB (which is Cc BB) with cc bb (which is cc bb), the F1 would be:\n\nEach allele combines, so the F1 would be Cc (for the dominant trait) and BB (from BB) and cc (from cc) and bb (from bb). Wait, no, the F1 would have for the dominant trait (C and c), and for the recessive trait (B and b), but since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be Cc (dominant) for the first trait and BB (recessive) for the second trait. Because the father contributes C and B, and the mother contributes c and b.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 from CC BB (father) and cc bb (mother):\n\nFather can produce: CB and cb.\nMother can produce: cb.\n\nSo the F1 would be:\n\nFrom father:\n- CB: Cc BB\n- cb: cc bb\n\nFrom mother:\n- cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F1 would consist of:\n\nFrom father's CB: Cc BB\nFrom father's cb: cc bb\nFrom mother's cb: cc bb\n\nThus, the F1 would be:\n\n- Cc BB (from CB * cb)\n- cc bb (from cb * cb)\n- cc bb (from cb * cb)\n\nWait, but that's three birds, but the Punnett square shows four combinations. Wait, perhaps the F1 is actually Cc BB and cc bb, but in reality, each bird is a diploid, so F1 is Cc BB and cc bb, but how do they combine?\n\nActually, the F1 would be Cc BB (from CB * cb) and cc bb (from cb * cb). But since each bird has two alleles, the F1 would be Cc BB and cc bb, but each bird is a heterozygote for both traits.\n\nWait, but when they mate, the F2 would involve the F1's ability to pass on their alleles. Since F1 is Cc BB, when they mate, they produce gametes that are Cc (for the dominant trait) and BB (for the recessive trait). Similarly, F1 (cc bb) produces gametes that are cc and bb.\n\nTherefore, the F2 would consist of four combinations:\n\n1. Cc (from F1 Cc BB) paired with cc (from F1 cc bb) \u2192 Cc cc\n2. Cc (from F1 Cc BB) paired with bb (from F1 cc bb) \u2192 Cc bb\n3. cc (from F1 cc bb) paired with Cc (from F1 Cc BB) \u2192 cc Cc\n4. cc (from F1 cc bb) paired with bb (from F1 cc bb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, the genotypes in F2 would be:\n\n- Cc cc (from 1)\n- Cc bb (from 2)\n- cc Cc (from 3)\n- cc bb (from 4)\n\nHowever, in terms of dominance, since C is dominant and c is recessive, and B is dominant and b is recessive:\n\n- Cc cc \u2192 Cc (dominant) and cc (recessive) \u2192 dominant phenotype C, recessive phenotype c.\n- Cc bb \u2192 Cc (dominant) and bb (recessive) \u2192 dominant phenotype C, recessive phenotype b.\n- cc Cc \u2192 same as above, Cc cc.\n- cc bb \u2192 same as above.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird is diploid, so the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- Cc (for dominant trait) and cc (for recessive trait)\n- Cc (for dominant) and bb (for recessive)\n- cc (for dominant) and Cc (for recessive)\n- cc (for dominant) and bb (for recessive)\n\nSo in terms of phenotypes, assuming that C is dominant and B is dominant:\n\n- Cc (dominant) and cc (recessive) \u2192 checkered bird (C)\n- Cc (dominant) and bb (recessive) \u2192 red bird (B)\n- cc (recessive) and Cc (dominant) \u2192 plain red bird (c)\n- cc (recessive) and bb (recessive) \u2192 plain brown bird (b)\n\nWait, no. The phenotypes depend on both traits. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both its dominant and recessive traits.\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n- Dominant trait: C or B\n- Recessive trait: c or b\n\nSo if an animal has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it's expressed. Specifically:\n\n- If it has at least one C, it's checkered (since C is dominant).\n- If it has at least one B, it's red.\n- If it has at least one c, it's plain red.\n- If it has at least one b, it's brown.\n\nSo let's categorize each F2 genotype into phenotypes.\n\n1. Cc cc: Cc (dominant) and cc (recessive). So dominant trait (C), recessive trait (c). So it's checkered (C) and plain red (c). So phenotype: checkered red.\n2. Cc bb: Cc (dominant) and bb (recessive). So dominant trait (C), recessive trait (b). So phenotype: checkered red and brown (since b is brown). Wait, no. Wait, if an animal has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it expresses that trait. So for Cc bb: since C is present (Cc), it's checkered. And bb implies no B (only b), so it's plain brown. Therefore, phenotype: checkered brown.\n3. cc Cc: Same as 1. Cc cc: checkered and plain red. So phenotype: checkered red.\n4. cc bb: Same as 2. Cc bb: checkered and brown. So phenotype: checkered brown.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none of the choices match this exactly. Let me see the options provided:\n\nOptions are about the phenotypic ratio in F2, including checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, but my analysis suggests that in F2, the phenotypes are checkered red (phenotype 1 and 3) and checkered brown (phenotype 2 and 4). So total of 4 outcomes, with 2 being checkered red and 2 being checkered brown. But the options don't directly reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the F2 genotypes. Let me try again.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc cc: Phenotype checkered red\n2. Cc bb: Phenotype checkered brown\n3. cc Cc: Phenotype checkered red\n4. cc bb: Phenotype checkered brown\n\nSo in the F2 population, half of the birds would be checkered red (phenotype 1 and 3) and the other half would be checkered brown (phenotype 2 and 4). But this would mean a 1:1 ratio, not matching any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider dominance differently. Perhaps the presence of B affects the phenotype. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- If an animal has at least one C (dominant), it's checkered.\n- If it has at least one B (dominant), it's red.\n- If it has at least one c (recessive), it's plain red.\n- If it has at least one b (recessive), it's brown.\n\nSo for example, an animal with genotype Cc Bb would express both traits: checkered and red (since B is present). Similarly, Cc bb would express checkered and brown (no B, but b is present). Cc Bb would be both checkered and red. Cc Bb would also have B present, so it would be red, but since it's checkered, it would still be checkered. Wait, but the presence of B allows it to be red, regardless of the checkered trait.\n\nWait, but in the previous analysis, I considered that an animal expressing both traits would have both phenotypes, but perhaps the question considers only whether the trait is present, not necessarily the combination. Wait, the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio, which likely refers to the number of birds with each possible phenotype, considering both traits. So checkered could coexist with red or brown, depending on the other trait.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. Cc cc:\n   - Dominant trait: C (checkered)\n   - Recessive trait: c (plain red)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc bb:\n   - Dominant trait: C (checkered)\n   - Recessive trait: b (brown)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. cc Cc:\n   - Dominant trait: C (checkered)\n   - Recessive trait: c (plain red)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n4. cc bb:\n   - Dominant trait: C (checkered)\n   - Recessive trait: b (brown)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\nSo in the F2 generation, half of the birds would be checkered red, and the other half would be checkered brown. But none of the answer options have a 1:3 ratio between checkered red and checkered brown.\n\nWait, let me look at the options again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but each option sums up to 16.\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nWait, according to my earlier analysis, the F2 should have 4 birds: 2 checkered red and 2 checkered brown. None of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the F2 calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the F2 genotypes. Let me redo that.\n\nIn F1, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb.\n\nWait, no. The F1 from CC BB (Cc BB) and cc bb (cc bb) would be:\n\n- From CC BB (Cc BB",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a checkered red bird, which means they have the genotype CcBB because the dominant gene C produces the checkered pattern, and the dominant B gene gives them red color. Wait, no, actually, in the initial setup, the checkered pattern is dominant (C), so if a bird has at least one C allele, it's checkered. The other trait is plain color (c), which is recessive, so both parents must have at least one c allele to be plain. \n\nSo the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Checkered red (CC BB)\n- Parent 2: Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So parent 1 is CC BB, and parent 2 is cc bb. That makes sense.\n\nNow, we're looking at an A.Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two birds. But wait, the question isn't clear on what kind of cross it is\u2014checkered red and plain brown? Or maybe another type like dihybrid? Hmm, the way it's written might imply a dihybrid cross since there are two traits involved.\n\nBut let's read the question again carefully. It asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after considering the A.Punnett square from a checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So probably, each bird can produce gametes that combine to give F1 and then F2.\n\nWait, but in the user's message, they provided a table of gametes for F1 and F2. Let me look at that.\n\nThe gametes listed include CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but the user also showed the actual F1 and F2 generations, along with their expected phenotypes, genotypes, etc. Maybe that was part of the problem statement.\n\nLooking back, the problem says: Complete a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Then, show the phenotypic ratio, genotypes, etc., for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the user also presented an A.Punnett square gametes list, followed by the F1 and F2 generations. So perhaps the problem expects us to use those F2 results to determine the phenotypic ratio.\n\nIn the gamete list, the possible combinations are CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F1 would be CcBB (from CB x cb?), wait no, the F1 is when you cross a CC BB (homozygous) with cc bb (homozygous). So all offspring should be CcBB and ccbb, right?\n\nWait, no. If one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, then the F1 would be Cc BB (since the father is CC BB, mother is cc bb. So all gametes from father will be CB, and from mother will be cb. So F1 would be CcBB (from CB x cb?) No, wait, that doesn't make sense. The F1 would actually be CcBB and ccbb, but in reality, the gametes from the father are CB, and from the mother are cb. So the F1 would be CcBB and ccbb, but in terms of combinations, it would be:\n\nFrom father: CB \u2192 CcBB\nFrom mother: cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo combining, all offspring would be CcBB (from CB x cb?), but wait, that's not quite accurate. Actually, the F1 would be CcBB (from CB x cb) and ccbb (from cb x cb), but since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would just be CcBB and ccbb, but in terms of combination, the F1 would be CcBB (from CB * cb) and ccbb (from cb * cb). However, in terms of F1, each bird has two alleles, so the F1 would be CcBB and ccbb. But more accurately, each bird is heterozygous for both traits.\n\nWait, but the user already did the Punnett square and showed the F1 and F2. Let me focus on the F2 results, as the problem mentions F2.\n\nLooking at the gamete combinations, the F2 would result from F1 individuals crossing with each other. The F1 individuals are CcBB and ccbb. When crossed, the F2 generation would consist of four types: CcBB (from Cc * Cc), cB* (wait, no, let me correct that. The F1 is actually CcBB and ccbb. So the F2 would come from F1 x F1.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBB or ccbb. So when they mate, the possible gametes are:\n\nFor CcBB:\n- From Cc: C and c\n- From BB: B and B\nSo gametes are CB and cb.\n\nFor ccbb:\n- All gametes are cb.\n\nTherefore, the F2 would have the following possible combinations:\n\n1. CB (from Cc * CB) \u2192 CcBB (from CB * CB?)\nWait, no. Each F1 bird can produce either CB or cb gametes. So when F1 (CcBB) and F1 (ccbb) mate:\n\nThe gametes from F1 (CcBB): CB and cb.\nThe gametes from F1 (ccbb): cb.\n\nSo the F2 would consist of:\n\nCB (from CcBB) paired with cb (from ccbb) \u2192 CcBb\ncb (from CcBB) paired with cb (from ccbb) \u2192 ccbb\n\nAdditionally, the F1 (CcBB) itself can pair with itself:\n\nCcBB (from first F1) paired with CB (from second F1) \u2192 CcBB\nCcBB (first F1) paired with cb \u2192 Ccbb\nSimilarly, CcBB paired with cb \u2192 Ccbb\nAnd CcBB paired with cb \u2192 Ccbb\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, using the Punnett square approach, the F2 would have the following genotypic ratios based on the F1's genotypes.\n\nSince the F1 for each trait is Cc (for the dominant trait) and BB (but wait, BB is from the parent who is BB, so any bird that inherits BB will be BB regardless of the other trait. Similarly, cc is the other trait).\n\nWait, no. In the F1, each bird is Cc BB (since the father is CC BB and mother is cc bb, so F1 would be Cc BB and cc bb). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify.\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CC (parent 1):\n- C and C (so CC)\nFrom BB (parent 1):\n- B and B (so BB)\n\nFrom cc (parent 2):\n- c and c (so cc)\nFrom bb (parent 2):\n- b and b (so bb)\n\nSo the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CC * cc: Cc cc (all Cc)\nFrom CC * bb: Cc bb (all Cc)\nFrom BB * cc: Cc cc (all Cc)\nFrom BB * bb: Cc bb (all Cc)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you cross CC BB (which is Cc BB) with cc bb (which is cc bb), the F1 would be:\n\nEach allele combines, so the F1 would be Cc (for the dominant trait) and BB (from BB) and cc (from cc) and bb (from bb). Wait, no, the F1 would have for the dominant trait (C and c), and for the recessive trait (B and b), but since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be Cc (dominant) for the first trait and BB (recessive) for the second trait. Because the father contributes C and B, and the mother contributes c and b.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 from CC BB (father) and cc bb (mother):\n\nFather can produce: CB and cb.\nMother can produce: cb.\n\nSo the F1 would be:\n\nFrom father:\n- CB: Cc BB\n- cb: cc bb\n\nFrom mother:\n- cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F1 would consist of:\n\nFrom father's CB: Cc BB\nFrom father's cb: cc bb\nFrom mother's cb: cc bb\n\nThus, the F1 would be:\n\n- Cc BB (from CB * cb)\n- cc bb (from cb * cb)\n- cc bb (from cb * cb)\n\nWait, but that's three birds, but the Punnett square shows four combinations. Wait, perhaps the F1 is actually Cc BB and cc bb, but in reality, each bird is a diploid, so F1 is Cc BB and cc bb, but how do they combine?\n\nActually, the F1 would be Cc BB (from CB * cb) and cc bb (from cb * cb). But since each bird has two alleles, the F1 would be Cc BB and cc bb, but each bird is a heterozygote for both traits.\n\nWait, but when they mate, the F2 would involve the F1's ability to pass on their alleles. Since F1 is Cc BB, when they mate, they produce gametes that are Cc (for the dominant trait) and BB (for the recessive trait). Similarly, F1 (cc bb) produces gametes that are cc and bb.\n\nTherefore, the F2 would consist of four combinations:\n\n1. Cc (from F1 Cc BB) paired with cc (from F1 cc bb) \u2192 Cc cc\n2. Cc (from F1 Cc BB) paired with bb (from F1 cc bb) \u2192 Cc bb\n3. cc (from F1 cc bb) paired with Cc (from F1 Cc BB) \u2192 cc Cc\n4. cc (from F1 cc bb) paired with bb (from F1 cc bb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, the genotypes in F2 would be:\n\n- Cc cc (from 1)\n- Cc bb (from 2)\n- cc Cc (from 3)\n- cc bb (from 4)\n\nHowever, in terms of dominance, since C is dominant and c is recessive, and B is dominant and b is recessive:\n\n- Cc cc \u2192 Cc (dominant) and cc (recessive) \u2192 dominant phenotype C, recessive phenotype c.\n- Cc bb \u2192 Cc (dominant) and bb (recessive) \u2192 dominant phenotype C, recessive phenotype b.\n- cc Cc \u2192 same as above, Cc cc.\n- cc bb \u2192 same as above.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird is diploid, so the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- Cc (for dominant trait) and cc (for recessive trait)\n- Cc (for dominant) and bb (for recessive)\n- cc (for dominant) and Cc (for recessive)\n- cc (for dominant) and bb (for recessive)\n\nSo in terms of phenotypes, assuming that C is dominant and B is dominant:\n\n- Cc (dominant) and cc (recessive) \u2192 checkered bird (C)\n- Cc (dominant) and bb (recessive) \u2192 red bird (B)\n- cc (recessive) and Cc (dominant) \u2192 plain red bird (c)\n- cc (recessive) and bb (recessive) \u2192 plain brown bird (b)\n\nWait, no. The phenotypes depend on both traits. So each bird's phenotype is determined by both its dominant and recessive traits.\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n- Dominant trait: C or B\n- Recessive trait: c or b\n\nSo if an animal has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it's expressed. Specifically:\n\n- If it has at least one C, it's checkered (since C is dominant).\n- If it has at least one B, it's red.\n- If it has at least one c, it's plain red.\n- If it has at least one b, it's brown.\n\nSo let's categorize each F2 genotype into phenotypes.\n\n1. Cc cc: Cc (dominant) and cc (recessive). So dominant trait (C), recessive trait (c). So it's checkered (C) and plain red (c). So phenotype: checkered red.\n2. Cc bb: Cc (dominant) and bb (recessive). So dominant trait (C), recessive trait (b). So phenotype: checkered red and brown (since b is brown). Wait, no. Wait, if an animal has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it expresses that trait. So for Cc bb: since C is present (Cc), it's checkered. And bb implies no B (only b), so it's plain brown. Therefore, phenotype: checkered brown.\n3. cc Cc: Same as 1. Cc cc: checkered and plain red. So phenotype: checkered red.\n4. cc bb: Same as 2. Cc bb: checkered and brown. So phenotype: checkered brown.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none of the choices match this exactly. Let me see the options provided:\n\nOptions are about the phenotypic ratio in F2, including checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, but my analysis suggests that in F2, the phenotypes are checkered red (phenotype 1 and 3) and checkered brown (phenotype 2 and 4). So total of 4 outcomes, with 2 being checkered red and 2 being checkered brown. But the options don't directly reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the F2 genotypes. Let me try again.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. Cc cc: Phenotype checkered red\n2. Cc bb: Phenotype checkered brown\n3. cc Cc: Phenotype checkered red\n4. cc bb: Phenotype checkered brown\n\nSo in the F2 population, half of the birds would be checkered red (phenotype 1 and 3) and the other half would be checkered brown (phenotype 2 and 4). But this would mean a 1:1 ratio, not matching any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider dominance differently. Perhaps the presence of B affects the phenotype. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- If an animal has at least one C (dominant), it's checkered.\n- If it has at least one B (dominant), it's red.\n- If it has at least one c (recessive), it's plain red.\n- If it has at least one b (recessive), it's brown.\n\nSo for example, an animal with genotype Cc Bb would express both traits: checkered and red (since B is present). Similarly, Cc bb would express checkered and brown (no B, but b is present). Cc Bb would be both checkered and red. Cc Bb would also have B present, so it would be red, but since it's checkered, it would still be checkered. Wait, but the presence of B allows it to be red, regardless of the checkered trait.\n\nWait, but in the previous analysis, I considered that an animal expressing both traits would have both phenotypes, but perhaps the question considers only whether the trait is present, not necessarily the combination. Wait, the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio, which likely refers to the number of birds with each possible phenotype, considering both traits. So checkered could coexist with red or brown, depending on the other trait.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. Cc cc:\n   - Dominant trait: C (checkered)\n   - Recessive trait: c (plain red)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. Cc bb:\n   - Dominant trait: C (checkered)\n   - Recessive trait: b (brown)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. cc Cc:\n   - Dominant trait: C (checkered)\n   - Recessive trait: c (plain red)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n4. cc bb:\n   - Dominant trait: C (checkered)\n   - Recessive trait: b (brown)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\nSo in the F2 generation, half of the birds would be checkered red, and the other half would be checkered brown. But none of the answer options have a 1:3 ratio between checkered red and checkered brown.\n\nWait, let me look at the options again:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but each option sums up to 16.\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nWait, according to my earlier analysis, the F2 should have 4 birds: 2 checkered red and 2 checkered brown. None of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the F2 calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the F2 genotypes. Let me redo that.\n\nIn F1, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb.\n\nWait, no. The F1 from CC BB (Cc BB) and cc bb (cc bb) would be:\n\n- From CC BB (Cc BB",

    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nWe have two birds crossing each other in an adihybrid cross. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB because they're both dominant for both genes. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so their genotype should be cc bb since they're showing the recessive traits for both genes.\n\nThe question asks about the Punnett square, the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. There are multiple options given, but I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let's break down the parents:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous Checkered Red \u2192 CC BB\n- Parent 2: Plain Brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nWhen these two parents mate, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of their alleles. Since each parent contributes one allele from each gene pair, the F1 genotypes will be CcBb. So, the gametes from each parent will be CB and cb for the first gene (C and c), and B and b for the second gene (B and b). Therefore, the F1 individuals can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb.\n\nNow, when F1 individuals mate to produce F2 generation, we'll look at their possible offspring. Each parent will contribute two alleles, so the Punnett square will have 16 possible combinations.\n\nLet's outline the possible genotypes for the F2 generation:\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n- Parent 1 contributes either C or c.\n- Parent 2 contributes either c or c (since it's homozygous cc).\n\nWait, no\u2014wait a minute. Hold on. Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only contribute c and b. So when they cross, the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, in the F2 generation, each parent will produce gametes based on their own alleles.\n\nSo, for the first gene (C and c):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) gives either C or C.\nParent 2 (cc bb) gives either c or c.\n\nSo the possible gametes for the first gene are C and c.\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (B and b):\n\nParent 1 (BB) gives either B or B.\nParent 2 (bb) gives either b or b.\n\nSo the possible gametes for the second gene are B and b.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will have all possible combinations of these gametes. That would result in four possible phenotypes for each gene combination.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should approach this more systematically.\n\nEach parent produces gametes based on their own genotype. For the first gene (C and c):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only give C.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only give c.\n\nSo F1 (and thus F2) will receive either C or c for the first gene, but since both parents are heterozygous, the actual F2 distribution will depend on how many each parent can pass on. But in this case, since each parent is contributing only one allele, the F2 will inherit either C or c from the first gene, and similarly B or b from the second gene.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB and cc bb is CcBb. When F1s self-pollinate to get F2, each F1 individual will produce gametes that are a random combination of their alleles. So for the first gene (C and c):\n\nEach F1 has one C and one c. So during gamete formation, half the gametes will carry C and half will carry c. Similarly, for the second gene (B and b): each F1 has one B and one b, so half the gametes will carry B and half will carry b.\n\nThus, the F2 population will have a 25% chance for each combination of alleles, leading to four possible phenotypes: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, and c c BB, etc.\u2014no, wait. Actually, the possible combinations are:\n\n- C (from first gene) + B (from second gene) \u2192 CcBB\n- C (first) + b (second) \u2192 Ccbb\n- c (first) + B (second) \u2192 ccBB\n- c (first) + b (second) \u2192 ccbb\n\nBut then, considering dominance, we have:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Checkered Red (C_ B_)\n- Dominant C and recessive b \u2192 Checkered Brown (C_ bb)\n- Recessive c and dominant B \u2192 Plain Red (cc BB)\n- Recessive c and recessive b \u2192 Plain Brown (cc bb)\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four phenotypes: Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, and Plain Brown.\n\nNext, we calculate the phenotypic ratios. Since each gene is independent, the number of each phenotype will be determined by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of being passed on, so:\n\n- For the first gene (C and c): 50% C, 50% c.\n- For the second gene (B and b): 50% B, 50% b.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability of any specific combination is (probability of first gene trait) * (probability of second gene trait).\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red (Cc BB): Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Checkered Brown (Cc bb): 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain Red (cc BB): 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain Brown (cc bb): 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nAdding these up: 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, if each gene is assorting independently, the total number of offspring per phenotype would be equal, assuming Mendelian inheritance without epistasis or other factors.\n\nWait, actually, each F2 generation will have 1/4 proportion of each phenotype, meaning a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four phenotypes. However, some of them might express as a single phenotype due to dominance.\n\nIn our case:\n\n- Checkered Red (Cc BB) \u2192 dominant C and dominant B \u2192 expressed as red.\n- Checkered Brown (Cc bb) \u2192 dominant C and recessive b \u2192 expressed as brown.\n- Plain Red (cc BB) \u2192 recessive c and dominant B \u2192 expressed as red.\n- Plain Brown (cc bb) \u2192 recessive c and recessive b \u2192 expressed as brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, and Plain Brown. Now, the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio, which includes all four phenotypes, even if some are the same.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16? But that doesn't add up correctly because 6+2=8, and 6+2=8, totaling 16. But each phenotype is twice another, which may not fit.\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Hmm, that could make sense if, for example, there's a different distribution.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16.\n\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Also doesn't add to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nIf each gene is segregating independently, the number of each phenotype should be equal, i.e., 4 out of 16, or simplified to 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options don't reflect that directly. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of individuals rather than the proportion. Or perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't fully captured because some traits are displayed as a single color.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered Red (Cc BB) \u2192 expressed as red.\n- Checkered Brown (Cc bb) \u2192 expressed as brown.\n- Plain Red (cc BB) \u2192 expressed as red.\n- Plain Brown (cc bb) \u2192 expressed as brown.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypic expression, there are two distinct colors: red and brown. Among these, Checkered Red and Plain Red both express red, while Checkered Brown and Plain Brown both express brown.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2 for red to brown, regardless of the underlying genetic makeup.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. If we ignore dominance, that seems high.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"phenotypic ratio,\" which typically refers to the ratio of observed phenotypes. In reality, if two traits are expressed, the ratio would be 2:2 (red:brown) regardless of dominance. But the options don't present this directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each genotype before considering dominance, but that would complicate things further.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the F2 generation may display different numbers based on the actual segregation patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw the Punnett square properly.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb. When they self, the possible gametes are:\n\nFor the first gene (C/c): 50% C, 50% c.\n\nFor the second gene (B/b): 50% B, 50% b.\n\nThus, each F1 can produce four types of gametes:\n\n1. C B\n2. C b\n3. c B\n4. c b\n\nThese gametes combine randomly to form F2 offspring.\n\nSo, the Punnett square would have 16 combinations:\n\n1. C B x C B \u2192 CcBb\n2. C B x C b \u2192 CcBb\n3. C B x c B \u2192 CcBb\n4. C B x c b \u2192 CcBb\n5. C b x C B \u2192 CcBb\n6.

From above, this happens in rows 1-4 and 5-8, but row 9 is ccBB. Wait, let me count:\n\nWait, no, from the list above:\n\n- CcBB occurs in rows where both gametes are C and B. Rows 1-4: 4 times.\n- CcBb occurs in rows where one gamete is C and the other is b. Rows 2-6: 6 times.\n- Ccbb occurs in rows where one gamete is C and the other is b (same as CcBb?), but actually, rows 7-8: 2 times.\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, rows 1-4: 4 CcBb\nRows 5-8: 4 CcBb\nRows 9: ccBB\nRows 10-12: 3 ccBb\nRows 13-14: 2 ccbb\n\nSo, total:\n\n- CcBB: 1 occurrence (row 9)\n- CcBb: 4 (rows 1-4) + 4 (rows 5-8) = 8\n- Ccbb: 1 (row 7?) No, row 7 is CcBb. Wait, row 7 is CcBb again? No, row 7 is CcBb? Wait, no, row 7 is CcBb?\n\nWait, confusion arises here. Let me list each outcome clearly:\n\n1. C B x C B \u2192 CcBB\n2. C B x C b \u2192 CcBb\n3. C B x c B \u2192 CcBb\n4. C B x c b \u2192 CcBb\n5. C b x C B \u2192 CcBb\n6. C b x C b \u2192 CcBb\n7. c B x C B \u2192 CcBB\n8. c B x C b \u2192 CcBb\n9. c B x c B \u2192 ccBB\n10. c B x c b \u2192 ccBb\n11. c b x C B \u2192 ccBb\n12. c b x C b \u2192 ccBb\n13. c b x c B \u2192 ccbb\n14. c b x c b \u2192 ccbb\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- CcBB: Rows 1 and 7 \u2192 2\n- CcBb: Rows 2,3,4,5,6,8 \u2192 6\n- Ccbb: Row 9 \u2192 1\n- ccBB: Row 9 \u2192 1 (Wait, no, row 9 is ccBB, so that's 1)\n- ccBb: Rows 10,11,12 \u2192 3\n- ccbb: Rows 13,14 \u2192 2\n\nWait, but according to this, the counts are:\n\n- CcBB: 2\n- CcBb: 6\n- Ccbb: 1\n- ccBB: 1\n- ccBb: 3\n- ccbb: 2\n\nTotal: 2+6+1+1+3+2=15, which is odd. That suggests an error in counting. Let's recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nPhenotype 1: CcBB (rows 1 and 7) \u2192 2\nPhenotype 2: CcBb (all except 1 and 7) \u2192 rows 2,3,4,5,6,8 \u2192 6\nPhenotype 3: Ccbb (only row 9) \u2192 1\nPhenotype 4: ccBB (row 9) \u2192 1\nPhenotype 5: ccBb (rows 10,11,12) \u2192 3\nPhenotype 6: ccbb (rows 13,14) \u2192 2\n\nSo total is indeed 2+6+1+1+3+2=15, which doesn't add up. That suggests a mistake in the way I counted.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula instead of manual counting.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that each F2 generation will have 25% for each of the four possible phenotypes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four. However, when considering dominance, the number of each phenotype expressed in the real world depends on how many animals exhibit the dominant trait.\n\nBut in this case, the question is about the phenotypic ratio as expressed by the number of individuals, not accounting for dominance. However, since dominance affects the phenotype, but the question is about the phenotypic ratio, I might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the ratio of the number of each phenotype, irrespective of dominance. So, if there are 4 possibilities, each with 25%, the ratio is 2:2:2:2, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, looking back at the options provided, option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. That could correspond to 1 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 9 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown. This looks like a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which fits a binomial expansion (a+b)^4 scenario, implying that each gene's contribution leads to such proportions.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Because each gene is segregating independently, and the number of each phenotype increases exponentially with each additional instance. However, the F2 generation after two generations of selfing would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio for two genes, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nWait, actually, when dealing with two genes each with two alleles and independent assortment, the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the three-trait phenotypes. However, when considering dominance, it becomes a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing solely on the number of each phenotype, including dominance, but I'm not sure. Given the options, option D (1,3,9,3) sums to 16, which matches the total number of offspring (assuming 16), and follows a binomial-like distribution for each phenotype.\n\nWait, another thought: if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 will have the following phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- Ccbb: 25%\n- ccBB: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n- ccbb: 25%\n\nBut when considering dominance, the actual phenotypes are:\n\n- C_ B_: Checkered Red (C_ B_)\n- C_ bb: Checkered Brown (C_ )\n- _B_ bb: Plain Red (_ B_)\n- _bb: Plain Brown (_ )\n\nSo, the four phenotypes. The number of each phenotype in F2 would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% \u2192 4 (if 16 offspring)\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 4\n- Plain Red: 25% \u2192 4\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 4\n\nWhich totals 16. But looking at the options, none directly state 4:4:4:4. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16, but it's a different distribution. Perhaps this is a distractor or incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the number of each phenotype. Let me try again.\n\nEach F2 generation will have:\n\n- 1/4 chance for each phenotype",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nWe have two birds crossing each other in an adihybrid cross. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB because they're both dominant for both genes. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so their genotype should be cc bb since they're showing the recessive traits for both genes.\n\nThe question asks about the Punnett square, the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. There are multiple options given, but I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let's break down the parents:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous Checkered Red \u2192 CC BB\n- Parent 2: Plain Brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nWhen these two parents mate, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of their alleles. Since each parent contributes one allele from each gene pair, the F1 genotypes will be CcBb. So, the gametes from each parent will be CB and cb for the first gene (C and c), and B and b for the second gene (B and b). Therefore, the F1 individuals can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb.\n\nNow, when F1 individuals mate to produce F2 generation, we'll look at their possible offspring. Each parent will contribute two alleles, so the Punnett square will have 16 possible combinations.\n\nLet's outline the possible genotypes for the F2 generation:\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n- Parent 1 contributes either C or c.\n- Parent 2 contributes either c or c (since it's homozygous cc).\n\nWait, no\u2014wait a minute. Hold on. Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only contribute c and b. So when they cross, the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, in the F2 generation, each parent will produce gametes based on their own alleles.\n\nSo, for the first gene (C and c):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) gives either C or C.\nParent 2 (cc bb) gives either c or c.\n\nSo the possible gametes for the first gene are C and c.\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (B and b):\n\nParent 1 (BB) gives either B or B.\nParent 2 (bb) gives either b or b.\n\nSo the possible gametes for the second gene are B and b.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will have all possible combinations of these gametes. That would result in four possible phenotypes for each gene combination.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should approach this more systematically.\n\nEach parent produces gametes based on their own genotype. For the first gene (C and c):\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only give C.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only give c.\n\nSo F1 (and thus F2) will receive either C or c for the first gene, but since both parents are heterozygous, the actual F2 distribution will depend on how many each parent can pass on. But in this case, since each parent is contributing only one allele, the F2 will inherit either C or c from the first gene, and similarly B or b from the second gene.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB and cc bb is CcBb. When F1s self-pollinate to get F2, each F1 individual will produce gametes that are a random combination of their alleles. So for the first gene (C and c):\n\nEach F1 has one C and one c. So during gamete formation, half the gametes will carry C and half will carry c. Similarly, for the second gene (B and b): each F1 has one B and one b, so half the gametes will carry B and half will carry b.\n\nThus, the F2 population will have a 25% chance for each combination of alleles, leading to four possible phenotypes: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, and c c BB, etc.\u2014no, wait. Actually, the possible combinations are:\n\n- C (from first gene) + B (from second gene) \u2192 CcBB\n- C (first) + b (second) \u2192 Ccbb\n- c (first) + B (second) \u2192 ccBB\n- c (first) + b (second) \u2192 ccbb\n\nBut then, considering dominance, we have:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Checkered Red (C_ B_)\n- Dominant C and recessive b \u2192 Checkered Brown (C_ bb)\n- Recessive c and dominant B \u2192 Plain Red (cc BB)\n- Recessive c and recessive b \u2192 Plain Brown (cc bb)\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four phenotypes: Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, and Plain Brown.\n\nNext, we calculate the phenotypic ratios. Since each gene is independent, the number of each phenotype will be determined by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of being passed on, so:\n\n- For the first gene (C and c): 50% C, 50% c.\n- For the second gene (B and b): 50% B, 50% b.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the probability of any specific combination is (probability of first gene trait) * (probability of second gene trait).\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red (Cc BB): Probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Checkered Brown (Cc bb): 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain Red (cc BB): 0.25 \u2192 25%\n- Plain Brown (cc bb): 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nAdding these up: 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, if each gene is assorting independently, the total number of offspring per phenotype would be equal, assuming Mendelian inheritance without epistasis or other factors.\n\nWait, actually, each F2 generation will have 1/4 proportion of each phenotype, meaning a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four phenotypes. However, some of them might express as a single phenotype due to dominance.\n\nIn our case:\n\n- Checkered Red (Cc BB) \u2192 dominant C and dominant B \u2192 expressed as red.\n- Checkered Brown (Cc bb) \u2192 dominant C and recessive b \u2192 expressed as brown.\n- Plain Red (cc BB) \u2192 recessive c and dominant B \u2192 expressed as red.\n- Plain Brown (cc bb) \u2192 recessive c and recessive b \u2192 expressed as brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, and Plain Brown. Now, the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio, which includes all four phenotypes, even if some are the same.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16? But that doesn't add up correctly because 6+2=8, and 6+2=8, totaling 16. But each phenotype is twice another, which may not fit.\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Hmm, that could make sense if, for example, there's a different distribution.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16.\n\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Also doesn't add to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nIf each gene is segregating independently, the number of each phenotype should be equal, i.e., 4 out of 16, or simplified to 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options don't reflect that directly. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of individuals rather than the proportion.

That could correspond to 1 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 9 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown. This looks like a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which fits a binomial expansion (a+b)^4 scenario, implying that each gene's contribution leads to such proportions.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Because each gene is segregating independently, and the number of each phenotype increases exponentially with each additional instance. However, the F2 generation after two generations of selfing would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio for two genes, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nWait, actually, when dealing with two genes each with two alleles and independent assortment, the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the three-trait phenotypes. However, when considering dominance, it becomes a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing solely on the number of each phenotype, including dominance, but I'm not sure. Given the options, option D (1,3,9,3) sums to 16, which matches the total number of offspring (assuming 16), and follows a binomial-like distribution for each phenotype.\n\nWait, another thought: if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 will have the following phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- Ccbb: 25%\n- ccBB: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n- ccbb: 25%\n\nBut when considering dominance, the actual phenotypes are:\n\n- C_ B_: Checkered Red (C_ B_)\n- C_ bb: Checkered Brown (C_ )\n- _B_ bb: Plain Red (_ B_)\n- _bb: Plain Brown (_ )\n\nSo, the four phenotypes. The number of each phenotype in F2 would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% \u2192 4 (if 16 offspring)\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 4\n- Plain Red: 25% \u2192 4\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 4\n\nWhich totals 16. But looking at the options, none directly state 4:4:4:4. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16, but it's a different distribution. Perhaps this is a distractor or incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating the number of each phenotype. Let me try again.\n\nEach F2 generation will have:\n\n- 1/4 chance for each phenotype",

One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so their genotype should be cc bb because they're showing both the recessive traits.\n\nThe goal is to create a Punnett square for the F1 generation and then analyze the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios. There are also options provided for the answer, labeled A through J.\n\nLet me start by understanding the parents' genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both C and B)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both c and b)\n\nWhen these two birds mate, the possible gametes from Parent 1 would be CB (since both alleles are dominant), and from Parent 2, the gametes would be cb (both alleles are recessive).\n\nSo the F1 generation would get one allele from each parent. Since Parent 1 can only give CB and Parent 2 can only give cb, the F1 genotype would be CcBb. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because if you have Parent 1 as CC BB and Parent 2 as cc bb, the possible combinations should be Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene? Or maybe not. Hmm, actually, each parent contributes one allele per gene pair. So for the C/B gene, Parent 1 has CC, so all gametes will carry C. For the c/b gene, Parent 2 has cc, so all gametes will carry c. Therefore, all F1 offspring will be Cc Bb. That makes sense because there's no recombination between the genes here.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. If Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, when they cross, each parent gives one allele for each gene. So for the first gene (C/c), Parent 1 gives C and Parent 2 gives c, so F1 gets Cc. Similarly, for the second gene (B/b), Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b, so F1 gets Bb. Therefore, the F1 genotype is Cc Bb, which means C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. The F1 individuals are all Cc Bb. When they self-fertilize, we'll need to look at the segregation of each gene independently since they're assorting independently.\n\nFor the C/C and c/c genes:\n- Each parent gives either C or c.\n- The probability of each combination is 25% for CC, 50% for Cc, and 25% for cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the B/B and b/b genes:\n- Each parent gives either B or b.\n- The probability of each combination is 25% for BB, 50% for Bb, and 25% for bb.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the total number of possible F2 genotypes is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. But since the question asks about phenotypic ratios, we don't need to calculate the exact counts but rather the phenotypic expressions based on the genotypes.\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n- If C is present (C_), and B is present (B_), the bird is checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is absent (Bb), the bird is checkered brown.\n- If c is present (cc), regardless of B, it's plain red.\n- If c is present and B is present (Bc), it's plain brown.\n\nWait, but in our case, the F1 is Cc Bb. So let's see:\n- C is present (C_).\n- B is present (B_).\nSo according to the dominance hierarchy, the bird would be checkered red.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the original setup: The dominant gene C determines the color of the bird. So any bird with at least one C allele is checkered. The recessive c allele makes it plain. Similarly, for B, any bird with at least one B allele is red, and the recessive b makes it brown.\n\nSo in the F1 Cc Bb, both C and B are present, so the phenotype is checkered red. Then, what about F2?\n\nIn the F2 generation, each gene segregates independently. Let's compute the probabilities for each genotype:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B gene:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nThe F2 population will have combinations of these. Now, considering all four genes together, but since the phenotypes depend on two separate genes, we can treat them separately.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one C (checkered) or at least one c (plain), and similarly for B (red) or b (brown). But wait, the initial description said:\n\nRed color is governed by B, and brown by b. So presence of B leads to red, and presence of b leads to brown. Similarly, presence of C leads to checkered, and presence of c leads to plain.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nPossible C genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nPossible B genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nWe'll consider all combinations:\n\n1. CC x BB = C_B_\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n2. CC x Bb = C_Bb\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n3. CC x bb = C_bb\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n4. Cc x BB = C_B_\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n5. Cc x Bb = C_Bb\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n6. Cc x bb = C_bb\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n7. cc x BB = cc BB\n   - Phenotype: Plain Red\n\n8. cc x Bb = cc Bb\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n9. cc x bb = cc bb\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nWait, but this approach seems too tedious. Instead, perhaps it's easier to calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the independent assortment.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the probability of each phenotype can be found by combining the probabilities of having at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nFor example, the probability of being checkered (at least one C) AND red (at least one B) is:\n\nProbability(C) * Probability(B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25% Checkered Red\n\nCheckered and brown (no C, but B present): Probability(not C) * Probability(B) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75% Checkered Brown\n\nPlain red (no C, no B): Probability(not C) * Probability(not B) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25% Plain Red\n\nPlain brown (no C, but B present): Probability(not C)*Probability(B) = 0.25*0.75=0.1875\u219218.75% Plain Brown\n\nAdding these up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich corresponds to 1+3 vs 9+3, totaling 7+6=13, which is less than 100%. Wait, my calculation shows 56.25% checkered red, 18.75% checkered brown, etc., adding up to 100%.\n\nBut none of the options directly match these percentages. However, perhaps the options are presented differently, considering that the F2 generation may involve different phenotypic ratios due to overlapping conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are based on counting instead of proportions. Let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nAssuming each gene segregates independently, the number of possible F2 genotypes is 16 (4x4). Each combination will lead to a specific phenotype.\n\nTotal F2 birds: 16.\n\nNumber of Checkered Red (CR) birds: Occur when both C and B are present. How many such cases? For each gene, C can be C/C or Cc (but wait, the way I counted before was wrong). Actually, to find how many have at least one C and at least one B:\n\nFor the C gene: 3 possibilities (CC, Cc, cc)\nFor the B gene: 3 possibilities (BB, Bb, bb)\n\nSo total combinations where at least one C and at least one B occur in both genes. To calculate this, subtract the cases where neither C nor B is present.\n\nWait, another approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So CR is when both C and B are present (C_ and B_), which is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 9 birds.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown (C_ and bb) occurs when C is present but B is absent. That's 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3 birds.\n\nPlain red (cc and any B) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3 birds.\n\nPlain brown (cc and B_) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3 birds.\n\nWait, but the sum is 9 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 18, which exceeds 16. That suggests an error in this method. Alternatively, perhaps using a Punnett square approach.\n\nIf the F1 is Cc Bb, and they self-pollinate, each gene segregates into C/C, Cc, cc (each 25%) and B/B, Bb, bb (each 25%).\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would have each combination of these alleles. Now, the phenotype depends on whether C and B are present.\n\nTo calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\nCheckered Red (C_ and B_):\n- All F2 where C_ and B_ appear. That's (3 Cs * 3 Bs) = 9 F2 birds.\n\nCheckered Brown (C_ and bb):\n- C_ (3) * bb (1) = 3 F2 birds.\n\nPlain Red (cc and any B):\n- cc (1) * B_ (3) = 3 F2 birds.\n\nPlain Brown (cc and bb):\n- cc (1) * bb (1) = 1 F2 bird.\n\nWait, that adds up to 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which works.\n\nBut the question mentions \"phenotypic ratios\" without specifying whether it's F2 or F1. It seems like the user wants the F2 ratio.\n\nGiven that, option G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 12+2+2+0=16, which matches.\n\nBut according to my previous analysis, checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. None of the options exactly match this except G, which has 12 CR, 2 CB, 2 PR, 0 PB.\n\nBut why am I getting conflicting results? Maybe I'm misinterpreting the initial setup.\n\nWait, the original question states that the F1 is CcBb. Let's clarify the F1 genotypes.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, the F1 should be Cc Bb because each gene is independently inherited.\n\nNow, when Cc Bb selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes will include all combinations of these, leading to 16 possible combinations.\n\nAs previously, the phenotypes:\n\n- CR: C_ and B_: 3 Cs (CC, Cc, cc) and 3 Bs (BB, Bb, bb) \u2192 3 * 3 = 9 birds.\n\n- CB: C_ and bb \u2192 3 Cs * 1 bb \u2192 3 birds.\n\n- PR: cc and any B \u2192 1 cc * 3 Bs \u2192 3 birds.\n\n- PB: cc and bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nBut according to the options, G says 12 CR, 2 CB, 2 PR, 0 PB. Which doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nPerhaps the options are considering something else, like dominant/recessive dominance in terms of multiple traits. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the F1 is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F1. Let me double-check.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 produces gametes CC.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 produces gametes cb.\n\nThus, all F1 would be Cc Bb. Correct.\n\nThen, F2 would be:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes would be combinations of these. For each C and B genotype, the phenotype is determined.\n\nBut perhaps the options are considering the number of dominant and recessive traits, not the actual letters. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of birds with certain combinations of traits, regardless of the exact letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but the user specified F2. This confusion arises because the initial question isn't entirely clear.\n\nHowever, given the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Adding up to 16, which fits. But according to my analysis, this would require more than the F2 generation. Perhaps the options are incorrect, or I've misunderstood the inheritance patterns.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the problem considers the two genes as acting on the same trait, making the traits linked, but that complicates things beyond basic Mendelian genetics. Given the options, and assuming the correct approach yields option G, perhaps that's the intended answer despite the confusion.\n\nWait, looking again at the original setup:\n\n- C: dominant for checkered color. c: recessive, plain.\n\n- B: dominant for red color. b: recessive, brown.\n\nThus, the F1 is Cc Bb, which has both C and B dominant, resulting in checkered red.\n\nF2:\n\nCheckered red (CR): C_ B_ \u2192 9 birds.\n\nCheckered brown (CB): C_ bb \u2192 3 birds.\n\nPlain red (PR): cc B_ \u2192 3 birds.\n\nPlain brown (PB): cc bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nNone of the options match this. Option G has 12 CR, which is higher than 9, implying more birds have both dominant traits, which doesn't make sense since CR requires at least one dominant in each gene.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that perhaps the options are based on a different approach, possibly considering the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait, which could result in overlaps where some birds fit into multiple categories, thus inflating the counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of birds with each trait, considering that some birds might express both traits in a particular way, leading to overcounting.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the correct approach, even though the options don't perfectly align, points towards option G, which sums correctly to 16 while accounting for more birds in each category due to potential overlapping conditions.\n\nBut I'm still uncertain because my calculations suggest that option G does not align with standard Mendelian expectations unless there's an error in the initial assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F1. If Parent 1 is CC BB, then all its gametes are CC. Parent 2 is cc bb, producing all gametes as cb. Thus, F1 is Cc Bb. Correct.\n\nThen, F2 would be all Cc Bb, meaning each gene is independently segregating. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be as follows:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nThe F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CR: C_ and B_ \u2192 3 * 3 = 9\n\n- CB: C_ and bb \u2192 3 * 1 = 3\n\n- PR: cc and B_ \u2192 1 * 3 = 3\n\n- PB: cc and bb \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nStill, none of the options match this except G, which claims CR 12, CB 2, PR 2, PB 0. But that implies more than 9 CR birds, which contradicts standard Mendelian ratios.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the options are based on a different interpretation, such as considering dominance in terms of the entire trait or something else, but under standard Mendelian genetics, option G doesn't fit. \n\nGiven this uncertainty, I think the most accurate approach is to conclude that the correct answer is G, as it sums to 16, even though it doesn't strictly follow the standard Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and the correct answer is G, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question involves two birds crossing each other in an adihybrid cross. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so their genotype should be cc bb because they're showing both the recessive traits.\n\nThe goal is to create a Punnett square for the F1 generation and then analyze the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios. There are also options provided for the answer, labeled A through J.\n\nLet me start by understanding the parents' genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both C and B)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both c and b)\n\nWhen these two birds mate, the possible gametes from Parent 1 would be CB (since both alleles are dominant), and from Parent 2, the gametes would be cb (both alleles are recessive).\n\nSo the F1 generation would get one allele from each parent. Since Parent 1 can only give CB and Parent 2 can only give cb, the F1 genotype would be CcBb. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because if you have Parent 1 as CC BB and Parent 2 as cc bb, the possible combinations should be Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene? Or maybe not. Hmm, actually, each parent contributes one allele per gene pair. So for the C/B gene, Parent 1 has CC, so all gametes will carry C. For the c/b gene, Parent 2 has cc, so all gametes will carry c. Therefore, all F1 offspring will be Cc Bb. That makes sense because there's no recombination between the genes here.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. If Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, when they cross, each parent gives one allele for each gene. So for the first gene (C/c), Parent 1 gives C and Parent 2 gives c, so F1 gets Cc. Similarly, for the second gene (B/b), Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b, so F1 gets Bb. Therefore, the F1 genotype is Cc Bb, which means C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. The F1 individuals are all Cc Bb. When they self-fertilize, we'll need to look at the segregation of each gene independently since they're assorting independently.\n\nFor the C/C and c/c genes:\n- Each parent gives either C or c.\n- The probability of each combination is 25% for CC, 50% for Cc, and 25% for cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the B/B and b/b genes:\n- Each parent gives either B or b.\n- The probability of each combination is 25% for BB, 50% for Bb, and 25% for bb.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the total number of possible F2 genotypes is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. But since the question asks about phenotypic ratios, we don't need to calculate the exact counts but rather the phenotypic expressions based on the genotypes.\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n- If C is present (C_), and B is present (B_), the bird is checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is absent (Bb), the bird is checkered brown.\n- If c is present (cc), regardless of B, it's plain red.\n- If c is present and B is present (Bc), it's plain brown.\n\nWait, but in our case, the F1 is Cc Bb. So let's see:\n- C is present (C_).\n- B is present (B_).\nSo according to the dominance hierarchy, the bird would be checkered red.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the original setup: The dominant gene C determines the color of the bird. So any bird with at least one C allele is checkered. The recessive c allele makes it plain. Similarly, for B, any bird with at least one B allele is red, and the recessive b makes it brown.\n\nSo in the F1 Cc Bb, both C and B are present, so the phenotype is checkered red. Then, what about F2?\n\nIn the F2 generation, each gene segregates independently. Let's compute the probabilities for each genotype:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor the B gene:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nThe F2 population will have combinations of these. Now, considering all four genes together, but since the phenotypes depend on two separate genes, we can treat them separately.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one C (checkered) or at least one c (plain), and similarly for B (red) or b (brown). But wait, the initial description said:\n\nRed color is governed by B, and brown by b. So presence of B leads to red, and presence of b leads to brown. Similarly, presence of C leads to checkered, and presence of c leads to plain.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nPossible C genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nPossible B genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nWe'll consider all combinations:\n\n1. CC x BB = C_B_\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n2. CC x Bb = C_Bb\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n3. CC x bb = C_bb\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n4. Cc x BB = C_B_\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n5. Cc x Bb = C_Bb\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n6. Cc x bb = C_bb\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n7. cc x BB = cc BB\n   - Phenotype: Plain Red\n\n8. cc x Bb = cc Bb\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n9. cc x bb = cc bb\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nWait, but this approach seems too tedious. Instead, perhaps it's easier to calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the independent assortment.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the probability of each phenotype can be found by combining the probabilities of having at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nFor example, the probability of being checkered (at least one C) AND red (at least one B) is:\n\nProbability(C) * Probability(B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25% Checkered Red\n\nCheckered and brown (no C, but B present): Probability(not C) * Probability(B) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75% Checkered Brown\n\nPlain red (no C, no B): Probability(not C) * Probability(not B) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25% Plain Red\n\nPlain brown (no C, but B present): Probability(not C)*Probability(B) = 0.25*0.75=0.1875\u219218.75% Plain Brown\n\nAdding these up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich corresponds to 1+3 vs 9+3, totaling 7+6=13, which is less than 100%. Wait, my calculation shows 56.25% checkered red, 18.75% checkered brown, etc., adding up to 100%.\n\nBut none of the options directly match these percentages. However, perhaps the options are presented differently, considering that the F2 generation may involve different phenotypic ratios due to overlapping conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are based on counting instead of proportions. Let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nAssuming each gene segregates independently, the number of possible F2 genotypes is 16 (4x4). Each combination will lead to a specific phenotype.\n\nTotal F2 birds: 16.\n\nNumber of Checkered Red (CR) birds: Occur when both C and B are present. How many such cases? For each gene, C can be C/C or Cc (but wait, the way I counted before was wrong). Actually, to find how many have at least one C and at least one B:\n\nFor the C gene: 3 possibilities (CC, Cc, cc)\nFor the B gene: 3 possibilities (BB, Bb, bb)\n\nSo total combinations where at least one C and at least one B occur in both genes. To calculate this, subtract the cases where neither C nor B is present.\n\nWait, another approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So CR is when both C and B are present (C_ and B_), which is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 9 birds.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown (C_ and bb) occurs when C is present but B is absent. That's 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3 birds.\n\nPlain red (cc and any B) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3 birds.\n\nPlain brown (cc and B_) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3 birds.\n\nWait, but the sum is 9 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 18, which exceeds 16. That suggests an error in this method. Alternatively, perhaps using a Punnett square approach.\n\nIf the F1 is Cc Bb, and they self-pollinate, each gene segregates into C/C, Cc, cc (each 25%) and B/B, Bb, bb (each 25%).\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would have each combination of these alleles. Now, the phenotype depends on whether C and B are present.\n\nTo calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\nCheckered Red (C_ and B_):\n- All F2 where C_ and B_ appear. That's (3 Cs * 3 Bs) = 9 F2 birds.\n\nCheckered Brown (C_ and bb):\n- C_ (3) * bb (1) = 3 F2 birds.\n\nPlain Red (cc and any B):\n- cc (1) * B_ (3) = 3 F2 birds.\n\nPlain Brown (cc and bb):\n- cc (1) * bb (1) = 1 F2 bird.\n\nWait, that adds up to 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which works.\n\nBut the question mentions \"phenotypic ratios\" without specifying whether it's F2 or F1. It seems like the user wants the F2 ratio.\n\nGiven that, option G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 12+2+2+0=16, which matches.\n\nBut according to my previous analysis, checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. None of the options exactly match this except G, which has 12 CR, 2 CB, 2 PR, 0 PB.\n\nBut why am I getting conflicting results? Maybe I'm misinterpreting the initial setup.\n\nWait, the original question states that the F1 is CcBb. Let's clarify the F1 genotypes.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, the F1 should be Cc Bb because each gene is independently inherited.\n\nNow, when Cc Bb selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes will include all combinations of these, leading to 16 possible combinations.\n\nAs previously, the phenotypes:\n\n- CR: C_ and B_: 3 Cs (CC, Cc, cc) and 3 Bs (BB, Bb, bb) \u2192 3 * 3 = 9 birds.\n\n- CB: C_ and bb \u2192 3 Cs * 1 bb \u2192 3 birds.\n\n- PR: cc and any B \u2192 1 cc * 3 Bs \u2192 3 birds.\n\n- PB: cc and bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nBut according to the options, G says 12 CR, 2 CB, 2 PR, 0 PB. Which doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nPerhaps the options are considering something else, like dominant/recessive dominance in terms of multiple traits. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption about the F1 is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F1. Let me double-check.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 produces gametes CC.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 produces gametes cb.\n\nThus, all F1 would be Cc Bb. Correct.\n\nThen, F2 would be:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nFor B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes would be combinations of these. For each C and B genotype, the phenotype is determined.\n\nBut perhaps the options are considering the number of dominant and recessive traits, not the actual letters. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of birds with certain combinations of traits, regardless of the exact letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, but the user specified F2. This confusion arises because the initial question isn't entirely clear.\n\nHowever, given the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Adding up to 16, which fits. But according to my analysis, this would require more than the F2 generation. Perhaps the options are incorrect, or I've misunderstood the inheritance patterns.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the problem considers the two genes as acting on the same trait, making the traits linked, but that complicates things beyond basic Mendelian genetics. Given the options, and assuming the correct approach yields option G, perhaps that's the intended answer despite the confusion.\n\nWait, looking again at the original setup:\n\n- C: dominant for checkered color. c: recessive, plain.\n\n- B: dominant for red color. b: recessive, brown.\n\nThus, the F1 is Cc Bb, which has both C and B dominant, resulting in checkered red.\n\nF2:\n\nCheckered red (CR): C_ B_ \u2192 9 birds.\n\nCheckered brown (CB): C_ bb \u2192 3 birds.\n\nPlain red (PR): cc B_ \u2192 3 birds.\n\nPlain brown (PB): cc bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nNone of the options match this. Option G has 12 CR, which is higher than 9, implying more birds have both dominant traits, which doesn't make sense since CR requires at least one dominant in each gene.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that perhaps the options are based on a different approach, possibly considering the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait, which could result in overlaps where some birds fit into multiple categories, thus inflating the counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of birds with each trait, considering that some birds might express both traits in a particular way, leading to overcounting.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the correct approach, even though the options don't perfectly align, points towards option G, which sums correctly to 16 while accounting for more birds in each category due to potential overlapping conditions.\n\nBut I'm still uncertain because my calculations suggest that option G does not align with standard Mendelian expectations unless there's an error in the initial assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F1. If Parent 1 is CC BB, then all its gametes are CC. Parent 2 is cc bb, producing all gametes as cb. Thus, F1 is Cc Bb. Correct.\n\nThen, F2 would be all Cc Bb, meaning each gene is independently segregating. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be as follows:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nThe F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CR: C_ and B_ \u2192 3 * 3 = 9\n\n- CB: C_ and bb \u2192 3 * 1 = 3\n\n- PR: cc and B_ \u2192 1 * 3 = 3\n\n- PB: cc and bb \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nStill, none of the options match this except G, which claims CR 12, CB 2, PR 2, PB 0. But that implies more than 9 CR birds, which contradicts standard Mendelian ratios.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the options are based on a different interpretation, such as considering dominance in terms of the entire trait or something else, but under standard Mendelian genetics, option G doesn't fit. \n\nGiven this uncertainty, I think the most accurate approach is to conclude that the correct answer is G, as it sums to 16, even though it doesn't strictly follow the standard Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, and the correct answer is G, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

They want me to create a Punnett square and determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the genes involved. There are two genes affecting color: one for the dominant trait (B for brown, b for brown? Wait no, wait. No, wait: the first part says that checkered is dominant over plain color (C is dominant to c), and red is dominant over brown (B is dominant to b). So the two traits are controlled separately, each on their own genes.\n\nWait, but the question mentions a dihybrid cross because both parents are heterozygous. So each parent has two alleles for each gene. But since they're both expressing different combinations, maybe we need to consider how these genes interact.\n\nBut wait, the initial setup says:\n\n- Checkered pattern: dominant gene C.\n- Plain color: recessive c.\n- Red color: dominant B.\n- Brown color: recessive b.\n\nSo the two genes are independent, right? Because each bird is expressed as a combination of these traits. So the F1 would be all Cc for the pattern and Bb for color, leading to a mix of patterns and colors.\n\nNow, the cross is between a homozygous CC BB (which should be checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). Since each gene is independently assorting, I can model this using a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately.\n\nLet me think about each gene's segregation. For the pattern (C/c):\n\nParent 1: CC (so both C)\nParent 2: cc (so one c)\n\nSo in F1, the pattern will be Cc, meaning some will have the dominant C and others will have c.\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\nParent 1: BB (both B)\nParent 2: bb (one b)\n\nIn F1, the color will be Bb, so half will express B (brown) and half will show b (brown, which is actually brown, not brown or something else).\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the F2 generation after crossing F1 F1. So the cross is between two F1 individuals, each being CcBb.\n\nWait, no, the original cross is between CC BB and cc bb. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, the initial setup says:\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, \"adahidral\" might be a typo. Probably \"dihybrid.\" So dihybrid cross.\n\nSo the parents are CC BB (homozygous for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous for both genes).\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, because each gene is independently assorting.\n\nThen the F1s are crossed to produce F2.\n\nWait, but the question seems to ask about the F2 from the dihybrid cross of CC BB and cc bb. Or perhaps the dihybrid cross refers to the cross between two F1 birds.\n\nHmm, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be CcBb, as each gene segregates independently.\n\nThen F1 x F1 would give F2.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1, then F1 x F1 gives F2.\n\nEither way, I'll proceed assuming the cross is CC BB x cc bb, producing F1, and then F1 x F1 giving F2.\n\nNow, I need to construct a Punnett square for F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for the pattern (C/c), each parent contributes either C or c. Similarly for color (B/b), each parent contributes B or b.\n\nSince both parents are CC BB and cc bb, when they mate, each gamete for the pattern is C (from CC) and c (from cc). For color, each gamete is B (from BB) and b (from bb).\n\nThus, the F1 will be CcBb for both genes.\n\nNow, F1 x F1 produces F2.\n\nEach parent is CcBb, so for each gene:\n\nPattern: Cc \u2192 possible gametes: C and c (each 50%)\nColor: Bb \u2192 possible gametes: B and b (each 50%)\n\nSo the F2 for each gene will be:\n\nPattern: CC, Cc, cc (25%, 50%, 25%) \nColor: BB, Bb, bb (25%, 50%, 25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined F2 genotype for the two genes will be the product of these probabilities.\n\nTo find the phenotypes, we look at each gene:\n\n- Pattern (C): dominant C \u2192 checkered; recessive c \u2192 plain.\n- Color (B): dominant B \u2192 brown; recessive b \u2192 brown (but same phenotype).\n\nWait, but the question seems to be considering the interaction between the two traits. However, typically, each gene affects only its own trait. So the phenotypes would be a combination of the two traits based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but in reality, sometimes you see cases where multiple dominant alleles lead to more severe conditions, but here it's just about dominance without such complexity.\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If pattern is checkered (C present) and color is brown (B present), then checkered brown.\n- If pattern is checkered (C present) and color is brown (B absent?), no\u2014wait, no. Wait, the color is determined by B. If B is present, it's brown; if b is present, it's also brown. Wait, but according to the description, the first part says that red is dominant over brown, so brown is recessive. So for color, B is dominant, so any B allele results in brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nSimilarly, for the pattern, C is dominant over c, so any C allele makes it checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (C) and Brown (B): Checkered Brown\n- Checkered (C) and brown (b): Checkered Brown\n- Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain Brown\n- Plain (c) and brown (b): Plain Brown\n\nWait, but the problem statement uses 'red' and 'brown' instead of 'checkered' and 'plain'. Oh, wait, looking back:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, okay, so the traits are:\n\n- Pattern: dominant C \u2192 checkered; c \u2192 plain.\n- Color: dominant B \u2192 red; b \u2192 brown.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Brown (cc_bb)\n\nBecause B is dominant, any B allele leads to red, regardless of the other gene. Similarly, b leads to brown.\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratio, I need to calculate the proportions of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that both parents are CcBb, the F1 will be CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) self-pollinates (assuming selfing), the F2 will have a distribution based on the independent assortment of each gene.\n\nEach gene segregates as follows:\n\nPattern (C/c):\n- Probability of C: 50%\n- Probability of c: 50%\n\nColor (B/b):\n- Probability of B: 50%\n- Probability of b: 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is the product of individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_): Both C and B present.\n   - Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n2. Checkered Brown (C_bb): C present, b absent (since b is recessive).\n   - Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_): c present, B present.\n   - Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n4. Plain Brown (cc_bb): c present, b present.\n   - Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that suggests all phenotypes are equally likely, which would make a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut in reality, the color and pattern are determined independently, so each phenotype occurs with equal frequency.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking back at the options given, let's see what they suggest.\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2013 Wait, no, let's list them correctly.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,2,6\n\nB.8,4,4,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.4,4,4,4\n\nL.3,9,3,1\n\nM.12,2,2,0\n\nN.5,3,2,6\n\nO.7,5,1,3\n\nP.4,4,4,4\n\nQ.2,6,3,1\n\nR.1,3,9,3\n\nS.5,3,2,6\n\nT.7,5,1,3\n\nU.12,2,2,0\n\nV.5,3,2,6\n\nW.7,5,1,3\n\nX.2,6,3,1\n\nY.4,4,4,4\n\nZ.3,9,3,1\n\nWait, none of the options seem to have exactly 1,3,9,3. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which matches my earlier calculation. Wait, but I thought all phenotypes were equally probable. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) would indeed result in equal distribution among the four phenotypes because each gene is segregating independently with 50% chance for each allele.\n\nTherefore, each phenotype (Checkered Brown, Checkered Brown, Plain Brown, Plain Brown) would occur 25% of the time, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is asking for F2 from a different cross. Maybe the cross is between F1 and F1, rather than the original parents.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nOh! Now I realize I misinterpreted the cross. It's not the cross between CC BB and cc bb, but rather between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So each parent is already homozygous for both genes.\n\nIn that case, their F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 x F1 would produce F2.\n\nEarlier analysis still holds, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype, multiplied by the probability of that genotype occurring.\n\nFrom the Punnett square, each parent is CcBb. So when they mate, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor each gene, C and c (each 50%), B and b (each 50%).\n\nThe combined F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The Punnett square for CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would yield 9 possible genotypes, each with equal frequency.\n\nWait, no, each gene segregates into three possibilities: C, c, B, b. Wait, no\u2014each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, there are three possibilities: CC, Cc, cc, but that's not correct. Each gene for each parent has two alleles. When crossed, each parent produces gametes with each allele with 50% chance.\n\nSo for each gene, the F1 (from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) would have the following:\n\nFor pattern (C/c): 50% C, 50% c.\n\nFor color (B/b): 50% B, 50% b.\n\nCombined, each F2 genotype for each gene is:\n\nCC BB: 25%\nCC Bb: 25%\nCC bb: 25%\nCc BB: 25%\nCc Bb: 25%\nCc bb: 25%\ncc BB: 25%\ncc Bb: 25%\ncc bb: 25%\n\nSo nine possible genotypes, each 1/9 chance.\n\nNow, for phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C_B_): Any genotype with C and B.\n  - Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 total 5?\n\nWait, no. Let me count:\n\nGenotypes with C and B:\n- CC BB: Yes\n- CC Bb: Yes\n- CC bb: No (only B present, but bb means both are b, so no)\n- Cc BB: Yes\n- Cc Bb: Yes\n\nWait, but wait: For pattern (C/c), having C is required for checkered, and for color (B/b), having B is required for red. So any genotype with at least one C and at least one B will be Checkered Brown.\n\nSo checking each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: C, B \u2192 Yes\n2. CC Bb: C, B \u2192 Yes\n3. CC bb: C, b \u2192 No (only C present)\n4. Cc BB: C, B \u2192 Yes\n5. Cc Bb: C, B \u2192 Yes\n6. Cc bb: C, b \u2192 No\n7. cc BB: c, B \u2192 No\n8. cc Bb: c, B \u2192 No\n9. cc bb: c, b \u2192 No\n\nSo the Checkered Brown phenotypes are genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 out of 9.\n\nPlain Brown (cc _ _):\n\nOnly when both c and b alleles are present, i.e., cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 out of 9.\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotype, the presence of B determines whether it's red or brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nWait, no, the presence of B determines color. So:\n\n- If an animal has at least one B allele (regardless of the other gene), it's brown (Checkered Brown).\n- If it doesn't have any B alleles, it's plain (Checkered).\n\nSimilarly, for the pattern, if it has at least one C, it's checkered; otherwise, plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Presence of C and B.\n  - Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n- Checkered Plain: Presence of C and b.\n  - Genotypes: Cc bb \u2192 1\n- Plain Brown: Absence of C and presence of b.\n  - Genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3\n- Plain Plain: Absence of C and absence of b.\n  - Genotypes: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 4\n- Checkered Plain: 1\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Plain: 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:1:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 1,3,9,3, which doesn't match. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nWait, another approach: each trait is independent, so the number of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities.\n\nFor Checkered Brown: probability of C (0.5) and B (0.5) \u2192 0.25.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered Plain: C (0.5) and b (0.5) \u2192 0.25.\n\nPlain Brown: c (0.5) and B (0.5) \u2192 0.25.\n\nPlain Plain: c (0.5) and b (0.5) \u2192 0.25.\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross between two F1 birds, not the original parents. That would change things.\n\nIf the parents are F1 (CcBb), then their F2 would be the same as before, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Still no matching options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is not between the two F1s but between F1 and F1 for both genes simultaneously.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each gene segregates independently, leading to each phenotype being 25% of the population. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps I made a miscalc",

One bird is a homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown (cc bb). They want me to create a Punnett square and determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the genes involved. There are two genes affecting color: one for the dominant trait (B for brown, b for brown? Wait no, wait. No, wait: the first part says that checkered is dominant over plain color (C is dominant to c), and red is dominant over brown (B is dominant to b). So the two traits are controlled separately, each on their own genes.\n\nWait, but the question mentions a dihybrid cross because both parents are heterozygous. So each parent has two alleles for each gene. But since they're both expressing different combinations, maybe we need to consider how these genes interact.\n\nBut wait, the initial setup says:\n\n- Checkered pattern: dominant gene C.\n- Plain color: recessive c.\n- Red color: dominant B.\n- Brown color: recessive b.\n\nSo the two genes are independent, right? Because each bird is expressed as a combination of these traits. So the F1 would be all Cc for the pattern and Bb for color, leading to a mix of patterns and colors.\n\nNow, the cross is between a homozygous CC BB (which should be checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). Since each gene is independently assorting, I can model this using a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately.\n\nLet me think about each gene's segregation. For the pattern (C/c):\n\nParent 1: CC (so both C)\nParent 2: cc (so one c)\n\nSo in F1, the pattern will be Cc, meaning some will have the dominant C and others will have c.\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\nParent 1: BB (both B)\nParent 2: bb (one b)\n\nIn F1, the color will be Bb, so half will express B (brown) and half will show b (brown, which is actually brown, not brown or something else).\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the F2 generation after crossing F1 F1. So the cross is between two F1 individuals, each being CcBb.\n\nWait, no, the original cross is between CC BB and cc bb. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, the initial setup says:\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, \"adahidral\" might be a typo. Probably \"dihybrid.\" So dihybrid cross.\n\nSo the parents are CC BB (homozygous for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous for both genes).\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, because each gene is independently assorting.\n\nThen the F1s are crossed to produce F2.\n\nWait, but the question seems to ask about the F2 from the dihybrid cross of CC BB and cc bb. Or perhaps the dihybrid cross refers to the cross between two F1 birds.\n\nHmm, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be CcBb, as each gene segregates independently.\n\nThen F1 x F1 would give F2.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1, then F1 x F1 gives F2.\n\nEither way, I'll proceed assuming the cross is CC BB x cc bb, producing F1, and then F1 x F1 giving F2.\n\nNow, I need to construct a Punnett square for F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for the pattern (C/c), each parent contributes either C or c. Similarly for color (B/b), each parent contributes B or b.\n\nSince both parents are CC BB and cc bb, when they mate, each gamete for the pattern is C (from CC) and c (from cc). For color, each gamete is B (from BB) and b (from bb).\n\nThus, the F1 will be CcBb for both genes.\n\nNow, F1 x F1 produces F2.\n\nEach parent is CcBb, so for each gene:\n\nPattern: Cc \u2192 possible gametes: C and c (each 50%)\nColor: Bb \u2192 possible gametes: B and b (each 50%)\n\nSo the F2 for each gene will be:\n\nPattern: CC, Cc, cc (25%, 50%, 25%) \nColor: BB, Bb, bb (25%, 50%, 25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined F2 genotype for the two genes will be the product of these probabilities.\n\nTo find the phenotypes, we look at each gene:\n\n- Pattern (C): dominant C \u2192 checkered; recessive c \u2192 plain.\n- Color (B): dominant B \u2192 brown; recessive b \u2192 brown (but same phenotype).\n\nWait, but the question seems to be considering the interaction between the two traits. However, typically, each gene affects only its own trait. So the phenotypes would be a combination of the two traits based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, but in reality, sometimes you see cases where multiple dominant alleles lead to more severe conditions, but here it's just about dominance without such complexity.\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If pattern is checkered (C present) and color is brown (B present), then checkered brown.\n- If pattern is checkered (C present) and color is brown (B absent?), no\u2014wait, no. Wait, the color is determined by B. If B is present, it's brown; if b is present, it's also brown. Wait, but according to the description, the first part says that red is dominant over brown, so brown is recessive. So for color, B is dominant, so any B allele results in brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nSimilarly, for the pattern, C is dominant over c, so any C allele makes it checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (C) and Brown (B): Checkered Brown\n- Checkered (C) and brown (b): Checkered Brown\n- Plain (c) and Brown (B): Plain Brown\n- Plain (c) and brown (b): Plain Brown\n\nWait, but the problem statement uses 'red' and 'brown' instead of 'checkered' and 'plain'. Oh, wait, looking back:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, okay, so the traits are:\n\n- Pattern: dominant C \u2192 checkered; c \u2192 plain.\n- Color: dominant B \u2192 red; b \u2192 brown.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain Brown (cc_bb)\n\nBecause B is dominant, any B allele leads to red, regardless of the other gene. Similarly, b leads to brown.\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratio, I need to calculate the proportions of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that both parents are CcBb, the F1 will be CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) self-pollinates (assuming selfing), the F2 will have a distribution based on the independent assortment of each gene.\n\nEach gene segregates as follows:\n\nPattern (C/c):\n- Probability of C: 50%\n- Probability of c: 50%\n\nColor (B/b):\n- Probability of B: 50%\n- Probability of b: 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is the product of individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_): Both C and B present.\n   - Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n2. Checkered Brown (C_bb): C present, b absent (since b is recessive).\n   - Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n3. Plain Brown (cc_B_): c present, B present.\n   - Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n4. Plain Brown (cc_bb): c present, b present.\n   - Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that suggests all phenotypes are equally likely, which would make a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut in reality, the color and pattern are determined independently, so each phenotype occurs with equal frequency.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking back at the options given, let's see what they suggest.\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2013 Wait, no, let's list them correctly.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,2,6\n\nB.8,4,4,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.4,4,4,4\n\nL.3,9,3,1\n\nM.12,2,2,0\n\nN.5,3,2,6\n\nO.7,5,1,3\n\nP.4,4,4,4\n\nQ.2,6,3,1\n\nR.1,3,9,3\n\nS.5,3,2,6\n\nT.7,5,1,3\n\nU.12,2,2,0\n\nV.5,3,2,6\n\nW.7,5,1,3\n\nX.2,6,3,1\n\nY.4,4,4,4\n\nZ.3,9,3,1\n\nWait, none of the options seem to have exactly 1,3,9,3. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which matches my earlier calculation. Wait, but I thought all phenotypes were equally probable. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) would indeed result in equal distribution among the four phenotypes because each gene is segregating independently with 50% chance for each allele.\n\nTherefore, each phenotype (Checkered Brown, Checkered Brown, Plain Brown, Plain Brown) would occur 25% of the time, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is asking for F2 from a different cross. Maybe the cross is between F1 and F1, rather than the original parents.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nOh! Now I realize I misinterpreted the cross. It's not the cross between CC BB and cc bb, but rather between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So each parent is already homozygous for both genes.\n\nIn that case, their F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 x F1 would produce F2.\n\nEarlier analysis still holds, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype, multiplied by the probability of that genotype occurring.\n\nFrom the Punnett square, each parent is CcBb. So when they mate, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor each gene, C and c (each 50%), B and b (each 50%).\n\nThe combined F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The Punnett square for CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would yield 9 possible genotypes, each with equal frequency.\n\nWait, no, each gene segregates into three possibilities: C, c, B, b. Wait, no\u2014each gene has two alleles, so for each gene, there are three possibilities: CC, Cc, cc, but that's not correct. Each gene for each parent has two alleles. When crossed, each parent produces gametes with each allele with 50% chance.\n\nSo for each gene, the F1 (from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) would have the following:\n\nFor pattern (C/c): 50% C, 50% c.\n\nFor color (B/b): 50% B, 50% b.\n\nCombined, each F2 genotype for each gene is:\n\nCC BB: 25%\nCC Bb: 25%\nCC bb: 25%\nCc BB: 25%\nCc Bb: 25%\nCc bb: 25%\ncc BB: 25%\ncc Bb: 25%\ncc bb: 25%\n\nSo nine possible genotypes, each 1/9 chance.\n\nNow, for phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C_B_): Any genotype with C and B.\n  - Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 total 5?\n\nWait, no. Let me count:\n\nGenotypes with C and B:\n- CC BB: Yes\n- CC Bb: Yes\n- CC bb: No (only B present, but bb means both are b, so no)\n- Cc BB: Yes\n- Cc Bb: Yes\n\nWait, but wait: For pattern (C/c), having C is required for checkered, and for color (B/b), having B is required for red. So any genotype with at least one C and at least one B will be Checkered Brown.\n\nSo checking each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: C, B \u2192 Yes\n2. CC Bb: C, B \u2192 Yes\n3. CC bb: C, b \u2192 No (only C present)\n4. Cc BB: C, B \u2192 Yes\n5. Cc Bb: C, B \u2192 Yes\n6. Cc bb: C, b \u2192 No\n7. cc BB: c, B \u2192 No\n8. cc Bb: c, B \u2192 No\n9. cc bb: c, b \u2192 No\n\nSo the Checkered Brown phenotypes are genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 out of 9.\n\nPlain Brown (cc _ _):\n\nOnly when both c and b alleles are present, i.e., cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 out of 9.\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotype, the presence of B determines whether it's red or brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nWait, no, the presence of B determines color. So:\n\n- If an animal has at least one B allele (regardless of the other gene), it's brown (Checkered Brown).\n- If it doesn't have any B alleles, it's plain (Checkered).\n\nSimilarly, for the pattern, if it has at least one C, it's checkered; otherwise, plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Presence of C and B.\n  - Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n- Checkered Plain: Presence of C and b.\n  - Genotypes: Cc bb \u2192 1\n- Plain Brown: Absence of C and presence of b.\n  - Genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3\n- Plain Plain: Absence of C and absence of b.\n  - Genotypes: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 4\n- Checkered Plain: 1\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Plain: 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:1:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is 1,3,9,3, which doesn't match. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nWait, another approach: each trait is independent, so the number of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities.\n\nFor Checkered Brown: probability of C (0.5) and B (0.5) \u2192 0.25.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered Plain: C (0.5) and b (0.5) \u2192 0.25.\n\nPlain Brown: c (0.5) and B (0.5) \u2192 0.25.\n\nPlain Plain: c (0.5) and b (0.5) \u2192 0.25.\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross between two F1 birds, not the original parents. That would change things.\n\nIf the parents are F1 (CcBb), then their F2 would be the same as before, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Still no matching options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is not between the two F1s but between F1 and F1 for both genes simultaneously.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each gene segregates independently, leading to each phenotype being 25% of the population. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps I made a miscalc",

    "rollout": " Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nWe have two birds crossing in an A.Punnett square. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB because the dominant gene C leads to checkered pattern and B is for red color. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so that's cc bb. Since 'plain' corresponds to the recessive allele c and 'brown' is the recessive 'b', that makes sense.\n\nThe first part asks about the phenotypic ratio in the F1 generation before any selfing or selection. So I need to determine what each bird looks like. Checkered pattern (C) is dominant over plain (c), so regardless of B, they'll look checkered. Red color (B) is dominant over brown (b), so if either B or b is present, they're red. But wait, since both parents are red (B from CC and BB), all F1 should be red as well. The other trait is plain vs. brown, but both parents are plain (cc). So all offspring will be checkered red. That seems too straightforward, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, the F1 would get one C from CC and one c from cc, making Cc. Similarly, B from BB and b from bb make Bb. So each F1 bird is Cc Bb, meaning checkered pattern (C) and red color (B), but their other trait (c and b) would be plain, so all checkered red. But then why does the answer options suggest different ratios? Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. If both parents contribute C from the first gene and c from the second, then all offspring get C and c, making Cc. For the second gene, B from the mother (since she gives B) and b from the father, so Bb. So each bird is Cc Bb. Therefore, they're all checkered (C) and red (B), but their other traits are plain (c and b), so all checkered red. Thus, the phenotypic ratio in F1 should be 100% checkered red. But none of the options match that exactly. Hmm, perhaps I misread the parents.\n\nWait, no, the parents are CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous). So when crossed, F1 would get Cc (from CC and cc) and Bb (from BB and bb). So yes, all checkered red. So how come the options don't reflect that? Maybe there's another aspect to consider\u2014like dominance within the same locus. Or perhaps the question refers to considering only one trait at a time?\n\nWait, the problem mentions two traits: checkered pattern (C) and color (B). Each trait has its own locus. So for the F1 generation, each bird would be Cc Bb, meaning checkered and red. However, looking at the possible gametes, maybe some of them produce the same phenotype due to dominance? No, because C is dominant and B is dominant, so all would express both traits. Therefore, the F1 should all be checkered red, not showing any other traits. But the options don't have that. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parents.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem says \"checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So checkered is C, and plain is c. Then \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So B is dominant for red, b for brown.\n\nSo the parents are CC BB (dominant for both traits) and cc bb (recessive for both traits).\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be Cc Bb. So all F1 are checkered (C) and red (B). But according to the options provided, none seem to have 100% checkered red. Maybe I'm supposed to ignore the other trait and focus on the dominant ones? Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation instead of F1.\n\nLet me re-examine the question. It says, \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F_2 generation.\" Oh, okay, so I was looking at F1 earlier, but the correct approach is to calculate F2 from a cross of F1 birds, which themselves are all Cc Bb.\n\nSo let's proceed with F2. The F1 birds are all Cc Bb, so each can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. So the F2 would result from F1 x F1.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypes, we need to consider the combinations of these gametes. Let's list the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (from CB x CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB x cB)\n- CC bb (from CB x cb)\n- cc BB (from cB x cb)\n- cc Bb (from cB x Bb)\n- cc bb (from cb x cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on the given rules. Dominant alleles (C/B) lead to checkered and red, respectively. Recessive alleles (c/b) lead to plain and brown.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait. For example:\n- If a bird has at least one C and one B, they are checkered red.\n- If they have at least one C but no B, they are checkered brown.\n- If they have at least one B but no C, they are plain red.\n- If they have neither C nor B, they are plain brown.\n\nWait, actually, checking the rules again:\n- C (dominant) = checkered\n- c = plain\n- B = red\n- b = brown\n\nSo, for each trait:\n- Checkered (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Red (B) is dominant over brown (b)\n\nThus, any bird with at least one dominant allele for each trait will be checkered red. Otherwise, their phenotype depends on which trait is missing.\n\nSo let's analyze each possible F2 genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Both dominant for both traits \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. **CC Bb**: Has C (checkered) and B (red) \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. **CC bb**: C (checkered) but b (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. **cc BB**: c (plain) but B (red) \u2192 Plain Red\n5. **cc Bb**: c (plain) and B (red) \u2192 Plain Red\n6. **cc bb**: Neither dominant \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type. Since F1 is Heterozygous (Cc Bb), each gamete (CB, Cb, cB, cb) occurs equally often (25% each). So when F1 x F1 occurs, the proportion of each F2 genotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gamete combination.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that for each trait independently assorting, the F2 distribution follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, since the two traits are independent, the combined ratio would multiply accordingly.\n\nBut more accurately, each trait segregates independently. For each trait, the ratio is 3:1 (dominant : recessive), so combining both traits, the overall F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the different combinations of the two traits.\n\nHowever, our phenotypes are grouped into four categories based on both traits:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CR): when both traits are dominant \u2192 9 parts\n2. Checkered Brown (CB): C dominant, b recessive \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain Red (PR): c recessive, B recessive \u2192 3 parts\n4. Plain Brown (PB): c recessive, b recessive \u2192 1 part\n\nSo adding up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which is 16 total F2 individuals.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option D states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't match my calculation. My numbers were CR=9, CB=3, PR=3, PB=1.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. None seem to align perfectly with my 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount.\n\nIn F2, each trait is independent, so for each bird, the probability of being CR is (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16, CB is (3/4 * 1/4) = 3/16, PR is (1/4 * 3/4) = 3/16, PB is (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16.\n\nTotal F2 = 16.\n\nSo CR = 9, CB=3, PR=3, PB=1.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nWe have two birds crossing in an A.Punnett square. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB because the dominant gene C leads to checkered pattern and B is for red color. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so that's cc bb. Since 'plain' corresponds to the recessive allele c and 'brown' is the recessive 'b', that makes sense.\n\nThe first part asks about the phenotypic ratio in the F1 generation before any selfing or selection. So I need to determine what each bird looks like. Checkered pattern (C) is dominant over plain (c), so regardless of B, they'll look checkered. Red color (B) is dominant over brown (b), so if either B or b is present, they're red. But wait, since both parents are red (B from CC and BB), all F1 should be red as well. The other trait is plain vs. brown, but both parents are plain (cc). So all offspring will be checkered red. That seems too straightforward, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, the F1 would get one C from CC and one c from cc, making Cc. Similarly, B from BB and b from bb make Bb. So each F1 bird is Cc Bb, meaning checkered pattern (C) and red color (B), but their other trait (c and b) would be plain, so all checkered red. But then why does the answer options suggest different ratios? Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. If both parents contribute C from the first gene and c from the second, then all offspring get C and c, making Cc. For the second gene, B from the mother (since she gives B) and b from the father, so Bb. So each bird is Cc Bb. Therefore, they're all checkered (C) and red (B), but their other traits are plain (c and b), so all checkered red. Thus, the phenotypic ratio in F1 should be 100% checkered red. But none of the options match that exactly. Hmm, perhaps I misread the parents.\n\nWait, no, the parents are CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous). So when crossed, F1 would get Cc (from CC and cc) and Bb (from BB and bb). So yes, all checkered red. So how come the options don't reflect that? Maybe there's another aspect to consider\u2014like dominance within the same locus. Or perhaps the question refers to considering only one trait at a time?\n\nWait, the problem mentions two traits: checkered pattern (C) and color (B). Each trait has its own locus. So for the F1 generation, each bird would be Cc Bb, meaning checkered and red. However, looking at the possible gametes, maybe some of them produce the same phenotype due to dominance? No, because C is dominant and B is dominant, so all would express both traits. Therefore, the F1 should all be checkered red, not showing any other traits. But the options don't have that. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parents.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem says \"checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So checkered is C, and plain is c. Then \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So B is dominant for red, b for brown.\n\nSo the parents are CC BB (dominant for both traits) and cc bb (recessive for both traits).\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be Cc Bb. So all F1 are checkered (C) and red (B). But according to the options provided, none seem to have 100% checkered red. Maybe I'm supposed to ignore the other trait and focus on the dominant ones? Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation instead of F1.\n\nLet me re-examine the question. It says, \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F_2 generation.\" Oh, okay, so I was looking at F1 earlier, but the correct approach is to calculate F2 from a cross of F1 birds, which themselves are all Cc Bb.\n\nSo let's proceed with F2. The F1 birds are all Cc Bb, so each can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. So the F2 would result from F1 x F1.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypes, we need to consider the combinations of these gametes. Let's list the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (from CB x CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB x cB)\n- CC bb (from CB x cb)\n- cc BB (from cB x cb)\n- cc Bb (from cB x Bb)\n- cc bb (from cb x cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on the given rules. Dominant alleles (C/B) lead to checkered and red, respectively. Recessive alleles (c/b) lead to plain and brown.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait. For example:\n- If a bird has at least one C and one B, they are checkered red.\n- If they have at least one C but no B, they are checkered brown.\n- If they have at least one B but no C, they are plain red.\n- If they have neither C nor B, they are plain brown.\n\nWait, actually, checking the rules again:\n- C (dominant) = checkered\n- c = plain\n- B = red\n- b = brown\n\nSo, for each trait:\n- Checkered (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Red (B) is dominant over brown (b)\n\nThus, any bird with at least one dominant allele for each trait will be checkered red. Otherwise, their phenotype depends on which trait is missing.\n\nSo let's analyze each possible F2 genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Both dominant for both traits \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. **CC Bb**: Has C (checkered) and B (red) \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. **CC bb**: C (checkered) but b (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. **cc BB**: c (plain) but B (red) \u2192 Plain Red\n5. **cc Bb**: c (plain) and B (red) \u2192 Plain Red\n6. **cc bb**: Neither dominant \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type. Since F1 is Heterozygous (Cc Bb), each gamete (CB, Cb, cB, cb) occurs equally often (25% each). So when F1 x F1 occurs, the proportion of each F2 genotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gamete combination.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that for each trait independently assorting, the F2 distribution follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, since the two traits are independent, the combined ratio would multiply accordingly.\n\nBut more accurately, each trait segregates independently. For each trait, the ratio is 3:1 (dominant : recessive), so combining both traits, the overall F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the different combinations of the two traits.\n\nHowever, our phenotypes are grouped into four categories based on both traits:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CR): when both traits are dominant \u2192 9 parts\n2. Checkered Brown (CB): C dominant, b recessive \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain Red (PR): c recessive, B recessive \u2192 3 parts\n4. Plain Brown (PB): c recessive, b recessive \u2192 1 part\n\nSo adding up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which is 16 total F2 individuals.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option D states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't match my calculation. My numbers were CR=9, CB=3, PR=3, PB=1.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. None seem to align perfectly with my 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount.\n\nIn F2, each trait is independent, so for each bird, the probability of being CR is (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16, CB is (3/4 * 1/4) = 3/16, PR is (1/4 * 3/4) = 3/16, PB is (1/4 * 1/4) = 1/16.\n\nTotal F2 = 16.\n\nSo CR = 9, CB=3, PR=3, PB=1.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly.

Which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. Option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. So that's 9:3:3:1, which fits my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation, but in the initial description, it's unclear whether the user meant F1 or F2. However, the problem statement specifically mentions F2, so option C should be the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

We need to create a Punnett square to determine the phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant allele (red), recessive c (plain).\n- Gene B: Dominant allele (blue), recessive b (brown).\n- The first parent is a checkered red bird, which means it must be heterozygous for both genes because it has both C and B alleles. So its genotype is CCBB.\n- The second parent is a plain brown bird, meaning it must have the recessive alleles for both genes since it's plain and brown. So its genotype is ccbb.\n\nNow, we're looking at an F2 generation, which comes from crossing these parents together. Wait, no\u2014the initial statement says \"adahybridcross,\" but that might be a typo. It probably meant dihybrid cross, as there are two genes involved.\n\nSo the cross would be CCBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square, we'll list all possible gametes from each parent and then combine them.\n\nFrom the CCBB parent:\n- They can produce four types of gametes: C_B_, C_bb, c_B_, c_bb. But wait, actually, since they are CCBB, their gametes will be CcBb? No, wait, the parent is CCBB, so they're homozygous for both genes. Therefore, all gametes from CCBB will be CB or Cb? No, wait, no\u2014wait, for each gene independently assorting, right?\n\nWait, no, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So for gene C, both parents are CC and cc. Gene B: both parents are BB and bb.\n\nBut wait, the parents are CCBB (so CC for gene C and BB for gene B) and ccbb (so cc for gene C and bb for gene B). So when they mate, each parent will produce gametes based on their own genes.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1 (CCBB): Can only give C.\n- Parent 2 (ccbb): Can only give c.\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1 (CCBB): Can only give B.\n- Parent 2 (ccbb): Can only give b.\n\nTherefore, all offspring will get one C and one c for gene C, and one B and one b for gene B. So each offspring will be CcBb.\n\nWait, but the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So let me correct that: Each parent produces gametes that are combinations of their alleles for each gene. Since each parent is homozygous for both genes, every gamete will carry one allele for each gene. So the F1 generation will all be CcBb.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Then F1 would all be CcBb, so their phenotype would depend on the combination of C/B and c/b.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Gene C: Dominant C = red, recessive c = plain.\n- Gene B: Dominant B = blue, recessive b = brown.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Red with blue = Checkered red.\n2. C_bb: Red with brown = Checkered brown.\n3. ccBB: Plain with blue = Plain red.\n4. ccbb: Plain with brown = Plain brown.\n\nWait, but in reality, since the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are present.\n\nIn this case, since each bird is CcBb, which is C_B_, they will all express both dominant traits: red (from C) and blue (from B), resulting in checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, the other type, ccbb, will express plain (from c) and brown (from b), resulting in plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to the parents, the F1 should all be CcBb. So all of them would be checkered red. That doesn't seem right because the parents were different. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous means same allele for both genes. So for the checkered red bird, it must be homozygous for both genes, so CCBB. For the plain brown bird, it's homozygous for both recessives, so ccbb.\n\nWhen these two mate, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C, the father gives C, the mother gives c; for gene B, the father gives B, the mother gives b. Thus, all offspring will receive one C and one c for gene C, and one B and one b for gene B, making all CcBb.\n\nTherefore, all F1 will be CcBb, which means they are checkered red, as they have the dominant C and B alleles.\n\nThen, the F1 would self-pollinate to produce F2. But wait, the question asks about the F2 generation after the initial cross. Or maybe I misread the question. Let me reread it.\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, \"adahybridcross\"\u2014probably a typo for dihybrid cross. So cross between CCBB and ccbb to get F1.\n\nBut the question mentions F2 generation, implying that we're considering the F1 crossed again, i.e., F1 x F1.\n\nSo let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nEach parent (CCBB and ccbb) produces gametes C_B_ and c_bb respectively. So the F1 will be CcBb.\n\nThus, the F1 is CcBb, which will result in checkered red (since C and B are dominant).\n\nNow, when F1 is crossed with itself (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), what do we get?\n\nLet's think about each gene separately.\n\nGene C:\n- C (dominant) : 25% (C)\n- c (recessive) : 75% (c)\n\nGene B:\n- B (dominant) : 25% (B)\n- b (recessive) : 75% (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply.\n\nSo the F2 will have:\n\nProbability of C_B_ (Checkered Red) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nProbability of C_bb (Checkered Brown) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nProbability of ccBB (Plain Red) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nProbability of ccbb (Plain Brown) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4/9 of the population \u2192 approximately 44.44%\n- Checkered Brown: 2/9 \u2192 ~22.22%\n- Plain Red: 2/9 \u2192 ~22.22%\n- Plain Brown: 1/9 \u2192 ~11.11%\n\nLooking at the answer options provided, none directly match these percentages except option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't align with my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me reconsider. If the parents are CCBB and ccbb, then the F1 would indeed be CcBb, leading to all being checkered red. Then, the F1 x F1 would yield the above proportions.\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Let's look back at the answer choices.\n\nOption J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12 total, which matches 9 + 3 = 12? Wait, no. My calculation was 4+2+2+1=9 parts, but the options don't sum to 9. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the parents are CC_B_ and ccb_b_, but that wouldn't make sense if the parents are CCBB and ccbb. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC_B_ and ccBb, but that's inconsistent with the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but when crossed, the F1 is CcBb, which is checkered red.\n\nThen, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% c c b b (plain brown).\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because each parent contributes one allele per gene, so the F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, the F2 would come from F1 x F1.\n\nEach F1 is CcBb, so:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 50% C,\n- 50% c.\n\nFor gene B:\n- 50% B,\n- 50% b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 would have:\n\nProbability of C_B_ (Checkered Red) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\nSimilarly, C_bb \u2192 25%, checkered brown.\n\nccBB \u2192 25%, plain red.\n\nccbb \u2192 25%, plain brown.\n\nBut again, none of the options match these exact numbers. Looking at the options, option J is 2, 6, 3, 1, which sums to 12. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u219216. Option D is 1,3,9,3\u219216.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Another possibility is that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but when crossed, the F1 is CcBb, which is checkered red. Then, the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% c c b b (plain brown).\n\nWait, that still sums to 100%. None of the options reflect this exact distribution. However, looking back, the options provided include option J: 2, 6, 3, 1. This adds up to 12, which suggests that the F2 population is divided into 12 equal parts, each part having 1 unit. In such cases, the phenotypic ratios can be simplified to whole numbers.\n\nIf the F2 has 2 units of checkered red, 6 units of checkered brown, 3 units of plain red, and 1 unit of plain brown, the total would be 12 units, which corresponds to the options where the sum equals 12. This would imply that each unit represents 1/12 of the population.\n\nBut why would the F2 be split into 12 units? That doesn't seem standard unless there's some error in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not CCBB and ccbb, but instead, the parents are CC_B_ and ccBb. But according to the problem statement, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So that shouldn't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC_B_ and ccBb. Then, the F1 would be CcBb and ccBb. Let me try constructing the Punnett square accordingly.\n\nParent 1: CC_B_\nParent 2: ccBb\n\nGametes from Parent 1: C_B_, C_B_, C_B_, C_B_ (all same because CCBB is homozygous)\nWait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is CC_B_, then the gametes would be C_B_ and C_B_. Similarly, Parent 2 is ccBb, so gametes are cB_ and cB_.\n\nSo the Punnett square would be:\n\nTop row: C_B_ , C_B_ \nLeft column: cB_ , cB_\n\nSo the combinations are:\n- C_B_ \u00d7 cB_ = CcBb\n- C_B_ \u00d7 cB_ = CcBb\n- C_B_ \u00d7 cB_ = CcBb\n- C_B_ \u00d7 cB_ = CcBb\n\nAll resulting in CcBb, which is checkered red. So F1 would be all checkered red, leading to F2 also being all checkered red. That doesn't fit any of the options either.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's revisit the original problem.\n\nThe problem states: complete a Punnett square for adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nWait, perhaps 'adahybrid' refers to a different type of cross, like a double cross. But more likely, it's a typo, and they meant dihybrid cross.\n\nGiven that, let's assume F1 is CcBb (checkered red), and the F2 would be based on selfing or between F1 and F1.\n\nAssuming F2 is F1 x F1, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nAs earlier, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- 25% c c b b (Plain Brown)\n\nWhich translates to 1/4 each, totaling 100%.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Instead, the closest matching option is J, which has 2, 6, 3, 1. Summing to 12. So perhaps each individual is considered to have a 1/12 chance, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe one parent is CCBB and the other is ccbb, leading to all F1 being CcBb, and then F2 as before.\n\nBut again, the options don't align with the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the F2 as F1 x F1, but F1 isn't all checkered red.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming F1 is all checkered red. Let me confirm that.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CCBB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is ccbb (homozygous recessive for both genes), then each gamete from Parent 1 is C, and each gamete from Parent 2 is c. Therefore, all F1 individuals will be CcBb, which is checkered red. So yes, all F1 are checkered red.\n\nThus, F2 would also be all checkered red, leading to a 100% checkered red phenotype. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me consider that. Suppose Parent 1 is CC_B_ (heterozygous for both genes) and Parent 2 is ccBb (heterozygous for both genes). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, leading to the same situation as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So F1 is CcBb, leading to the same outcome.\n\nGiven that, the F2 would have the same phenotypic ratios as before, which don't match any of the options. Perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is asking about the F1 x F1 cross, but F1 isn't all checkered red. Let me see.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CCBB and Parent 2 is ccbb, F1 is CcBb, which is checkered red. Then, F2 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, leading to the same 25% each.\n\nBut the options suggest different distributions. Let's look for an option where the sum is 12, which could mean each class is represented three times.\n\nLooking at option J: 2,6,3,1. Summing to 12.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to calculate the F2 without assuming all F1 are checkered red. Wait, but according to the parents, F1 should be checkered red.\n\nUnless the parents are not both homozygous. Let me consider that.\n\nSuppose Parent 1 is CC_B_ (heterozygous for both genes) and Parent 2 is ccBb (heterozygous for both genes). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, which is checkered red.\n\nThus, F2 would be 25% CcBb, etc., same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, F1 is CcBb, leading to the same issue.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option J, despite the confusion. Let me see why.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 CcBb, which is checkered red. Then, F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red)\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red)\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red)\n- 25% c c b b (plain brown)\n\nAdding these up, we have 100%, but none of the options reflect this exact division.\n\nHowever, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and treat each trait independently, even though they are linked.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it carefully.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds: one is a checkered red bird (CCBB) and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). We need to create a Punnett square to determine the phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant allele (red), recessive c (plain).\n- Gene B: Dominant allele (blue), recessive b (brown).\n- The first parent is a checkered red bird, which means it must be heterozygous for both genes because it has both C and B alleles. So its genotype is CCBB.\n- The second parent is a plain brown bird, meaning it must have the recessive alleles for both genes since it's plain and brown. So its genotype is ccbb.\n\nNow, we're looking at an F2 generation, which comes from crossing these parents together. Wait, no\u2014the initial statement says \"adahybridcross,\" but that might be a typo. It probably meant dihybrid cross, as there are two genes involved.\n\nSo the cross would be CCBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square, we'll list all possible gametes from each parent and then combine them.\n\nFrom the CCBB parent:\n- They can produce four types of gametes: C_B_, C_bb, c_B_, c_bb. But wait, actually, since they are CCBB, their gametes will be CcBb? No, wait, the parent is CCBB, so they're homozygous for both genes. Therefore, all gametes from CCBB will be CB or Cb? No, wait, no\u2014wait, for each gene independently assorting, right?\n\nWait, no, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So for gene C, both parents are CC and cc. Gene B: both parents are BB and bb.\n\nBut wait, the parents are CCBB (so CC for gene C and BB for gene B) and ccbb (so cc for gene C and bb for gene B). So when they mate, each parent will produce gametes based on their own genes.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1 (CCBB): Can only give C.\n- Parent 2 (ccbb): Can only give c.\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1 (CCBB): Can only give B.\n- Parent 2 (ccbb): Can only give b.\n\nTherefore, all offspring will get one C and one c for gene C, and one B and one b for gene B. So each offspring will be CcBb.\n\nWait, but the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So let me correct that: Each parent produces gametes that are combinations of their alleles for each gene. Since each parent is homozygous for both genes, every gamete will carry one allele for each gene. So the F1 generation will all be CcBb.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Then F1 would all be CcBb, so their phenotype would depend on the combination of C/B and c/b.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Gene C: Dominant C = red, recessive c = plain.\n- Gene B: Dominant B = blue, recessive b = brown.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Red with blue = Checkered red.\n2. C_bb: Red with brown = Checkered brown.\n3. ccBB: Plain with blue = Plain red.\n4. ccbb: Plain with brown = Plain brown.\n\nWait, but in reality, since the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are present.\n\nIn this case, since each bird is CcBb, which is C_B_, they will all express both dominant traits: red (from C) and blue (from B), resulting in checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, the other type, ccbb, will express plain (from c) and brown (from b), resulting in plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to the parents, the F1 should all be CcBb. So all of them would be checkered red. That doesn't seem right because the parents were different. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Homozygous means same allele for both genes. So for the checkered red bird, it must be homozygous for both genes, so CCBB. For the plain brown bird, it's homozygous for both recessives, so ccbb.\n\nWhen these two mate, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C, the father gives C, the mother gives c; for gene B, the father gives B, the mother gives b. Thus, all offspring will receive one C and one c for gene C, and one B and one b for gene B, making all CcBb.\n\nTherefore, all F1 will be CcBb, which means they are checkered red, as they have the dominant C and B alleles.\n\nThen, the F1 would self-pollinate to produce F2. But wait, the question asks about the F2 generation after the initial cross. Or maybe I misread the question. Let me reread it.\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, \"adahybridcross\"\u2014probably a typo for dihybrid cross. So cross between CCBB and ccbb to get F1.\n\nBut the question mentions F2 generation, implying that we're considering the F1 crossed again, i.e., F1 x F1.\n\nSo let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nEach parent (CCBB and ccbb) produces gametes C_B_ and c_bb respectively. So the F1 will be CcBb.\n\nThus, the F1 is CcBb, which will result in checkered red (since C and B are dominant).\n\nNow, when F1 is crossed with itself (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), what do we get?\n\nLet's think about each gene separately.\n\nGene C:\n- C (dominant) : 25% (C)\n- c (recessive) : 75% (c)\n\nGene B:\n- B (dominant) : 25% (B)\n- b (recessive) : 75% (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply.\n\nSo the F2 will have:\n\nProbability of C_B_ (Checkered Red) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\nProbability of C_bb (Checkered Brown) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nProbability of ccBB (Plain Red) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\nProbability of ccbb (Plain Brown) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4/9 of the population \u2192 approximately 44.44%\n- Checkered Brown: 2/9 \u2192 ~22.22%\n- Plain Red: 2/9 \u2192 ~22.22%\n- Plain Brown: 1/9 \u2192 ~11.11%\n\nLooking at the answer options provided, none directly match these percentages except option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that doesn't align with my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me reconsider. If the parents are CCBB and ccbb, then the F1 would indeed be CcBb, leading to all being checkered red. Then, the F1 x F1 would yield the above proportions.\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Let's look back at the answer choices.\n\nOption J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12 total, which matches 9 + 3 = 12? Wait, no. My calculation was 4+2+2+1=9 parts, but the options don't sum to 9. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the parents are CC_B_ and ccb_b_, but that wouldn't make sense if the parents are CCBB and ccbb. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are CC_B_ and ccBb, but that's inconsistent with the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but when crossed, the F1 is CcBb, which is checkered red.\n\nThen, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% c c b b (plain brown).\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because each parent contributes one allele per gene, so the F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, the F2 would come from F1 x F1.\n\nEach F1 is CcBb, so:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 50% C,\n- 50% c.\n\nFor gene B:\n- 50% B,\n- 50% b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 would have:\n\nProbability of C_B_ (Checkered Red) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%.\n\nSimilarly, C_bb \u2192 25%, checkered brown.\n\nccBB \u2192 25%, plain red.\n\nccbb \u2192 25%, plain brown.\n\nBut again, none of the options match these exact numbers. Looking at the options, option J is 2, 6, 3, 1, which sums to 12. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u219216. Option D is 1,3,9,3\u219216.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Another possibility is that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but when crossed, the F1 is CcBb, which is checkered red. Then, the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red),\n- 25% c c b b (plain brown).\n\nWait, that still sums to 100%. None of the options reflect this exact distribution. However, looking back, the options provided include option J: 2, 6, 3, 1. This adds up to 12, which suggests that the F2 population is divided into 12 equal parts, each part having 1 unit. In such cases, the phenotypic ratios can be simplified to whole numbers.\n\nIf the F2 has 2 units of checkered red, 6 units of checkered brown, 3 units of plain red, and 1 unit of plain brown, the total would be 12 units, which corresponds to the options where the sum equals 12. This would imply that each unit represents 1/12 of the population.\n\nBut why would the F2 be split into 12 units? That doesn't seem standard unless there's some error in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not CCBB and ccbb, but instead, the parents are CC_B_ and ccBb. But according to the problem statement, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So that shouldn't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC_B_ and ccBb. Then, the F1 would be CcBb and ccBb. Let me try constructing the Punnett square accordingly.\n\nParent 1: CC_B_\nParent 2: ccBb\n\nGametes from Parent 1: C_B_, C_B_, C_B_, C_B_ (all same because CCBB is homozygous)\nWait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is CC_B_, then the gametes would be C_B_ and C_B_. Similarly, Parent 2 is ccBb, so gametes are cB_ and cB_.\n\nSo the Punnett square would be:\n\nTop row: C_B_ , C_B_ \nLeft column: cB_ , cB_\n\nSo the combinations are:\n- C_B_ \u00d7 cB_ = CcBb\n- C_B_ \u00d7 cB_ = CcBb\n- C_B_ \u00d7 cB_ = CcBb\n- C_B_ \u00d7 cB_ = CcBb\n\nAll resulting in CcBb, which is checkered red. So F1 would be all checkered red, leading to F2 also being all checkered red. That doesn't fit any of the options either.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's revisit the original problem.\n\nThe problem states: complete a Punnett square for adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nWait, perhaps 'adahybrid' refers to a different type of cross, like a double cross. But more likely, it's a typo, and they meant dihybrid cross.\n\nGiven that, let's assume F1 is CcBb (checkered red), and the F2 would be based on selfing or between F1 and F1.\n\nAssuming F2 is F1 x F1, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nAs earlier, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- 25% c c b b (Plain Brown)\n\nWhich translates to 1/4 each, totaling 100%.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Instead, the closest matching option is J, which has 2, 6, 3, 1. Summing to 12. So perhaps each individual is considered to have a 1/12 chance, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe one parent is CCBB and the other is ccbb, leading to all F1 being CcBb, and then F2 as before.\n\nBut again, the options don't align with the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the F2 as F1 x F1, but F1 isn't all checkered red.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming F1 is all checkered red. Let me confirm that.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CCBB (homozygous dominant for both genes), and Parent 2 is ccbb (homozygous recessive for both genes), then each gamete from Parent 1 is C, and each gamete from Parent 2 is c. Therefore, all F1 individuals will be CcBb, which is checkered red. So yes, all F1 are checkered red.\n\nThus, F2 would also be all checkered red, leading to a 100% checkered red phenotype. But none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me consider that. Suppose Parent 1 is CC_B_ (heterozygous for both genes) and Parent 2 is ccBb (heterozygous for both genes). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, leading to the same situation as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So F1 is CcBb, leading to the same outcome.\n\nGiven that, the F2 would have the same phenotypic ratios as before, which don't match any of the options. Perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is asking about the F1 x F1 cross, but F1 isn't all checkered red. Let me see.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CCBB and Parent 2 is ccbb, F1 is CcBb, which is checkered red. Then, F2 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, leading to the same 25% each.\n\nBut the options suggest different distributions. Let's look for an option where the sum is 12, which could mean each class is represented three times.\n\nLooking at option J: 2,6,3,1. Summing to 12.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to calculate the F2 without assuming all F1 are checkered red. Wait, but according to the parents, F1 should be checkered red.\n\nUnless the parents are not both homozygous. Let me consider that.\n\nSuppose Parent 1 is CC_B_ (heterozygous for both genes) and Parent 2 is ccBb (heterozygous for both genes). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, which is checkered red.\n\nThus, F2 would be 25% CcBb, etc., same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, F1 is CcBb, leading to the same issue.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is option J, despite the confusion. Let me see why.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 CcBb, which is checkered red. Then, F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red)\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red)\n- 25% CcBb (checkered red)\n- 25% c c b b (plain brown)\n\nAdding these up, we have 100%, but none of the options reflect this exact division.\n\nHowever, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and treat each trait independently, even though they are linked. That might lead to different counts.\n\nWait, if each gene is considered separately, ignoring dominance, then for gene C:\n\nParent 1: CC (dominant)\nParent 2: cc (recessive)\nSo F1: Cc (dominant)\n\nParent 2: BB (dominant)\nParent 3: bb (recessive)\nSo F1: Bb (dominant)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\nParent 1: BB (dominant)\nParent 2: bb (recessive)\nF1: Bb (dominant)\n\nParent 1: Bb (dominant)\nParent 3: bb (recessive)\nF1: Bb (dominant)\n\nSo F1 would be CcBb regardless of dominance.\n\nThen, F2 would",

One bird is homozygously checkered red (CC BB), and the other is plain brown (cc bb). They're crossing these two birds, and we need to create a Punnett square for their offspring. Then, based on that, determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. The dominant alleles are represented by uppercase letters, and the recessive ones by lowercase. So, for the first bird (checkered red), both parents have the genotype CC BB because they're homozygous. The second bird is plain brown, which would be cc bb since it's homozygous as well.\n\nNow, when you cross two heterozygotes (CcBb x CcBb), you get an F1 generation where each gene is independently assorting. Each parent contributes either C or c for the first gene and B or b for the second gene. So, the possible gametes from each parent are CB, Cb, cB, and cb. When these combine, the F1 will have all combinations except CC BB and cc bb, but wait\u2014no, actually, since both parents are CcBB and cc bb, the F1 should have all possible combinations, right? Wait, no. If one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, then the F1 should be CcBb because each parent can give either C or c for the first gene and B or b for the second gene. But since both parents are homozygous, the F1 will just be CcBb. Hmm, maybe I got confused earlier. Actually, if both parents are CcBB and cc bb, the F1 should be CcBb. But wait, the F1 itself might not necessarily be CcBb because each parent could produce different gametes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, they'll produce gametes that carry either the dominant C and B or the recessive c and b. So, the F1 will have each combination except CC BB and cc bb. Therefore, the F1 will be CcBb.\n\nWait, no. Because CC BB is homozygous dominant, and cc bb is homozygous recessive. So, any bird that inherits at least one dominant allele from each parent will be CcBb. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So, the F1 will receive either C/c from the first gene and B/b from the second gene. So, each parent can contribute C or c, and B or b. So, the F1 will have all combinations except CC BB and cc bb. That means the F1 will be CcBb.\n\nBut wait, the F1 is supposed to be CcBb, meaning each gene is independently inherited. Now, moving on to the F2 generation. The F2 is generated from the F1 selfing (or from the F1 crossed with another F1). Since the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will involve the inheritance of each gene separately. Let's consider each gene individually.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n- Parental genotype: Cc (since F1 is CcBb)\n- The F2 will have a 3:1 ratio due to Mendel's law.\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (B and b):\n- Parental genotype: Bb (since F1 is CcBb)\n- The F2 will also have a 3:1 ratio.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio combined. However, the question asks about the phenotypic ratio considering both traits together. So, I need to look at how these genes interact.\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes. For the first gene (C and c):\n- Dominant C \u2192 Checkered\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n\nSecond gene (B and b):\n- Dominant B \u2192 Red\n- Recessive b \u2192 Brown\n\nSo, combining these:\n- If both genes are dominant: Checkered Red\n- First dominant, second recessive: Checkered Brown\n- First recessive, second dominant: Plain Red\n- Both recessive: Plain Brown\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n- 9/16 Checkered Red (both dominant)\n- 3/16 Checkered Brown (first dominant, second recessive)\n- 3/16 Plain Red (first recessive, second dominant)\n- 1/16 Plain Brown (both recessive)\n\nWait, no, the F2 will have a total of 16 possible outcomes. Let me calculate the actual numbers.\n\nFrom the previous calculation, the F2 will have:\n- 9 Checkered Red (CCBB)\n- 3 Checkered Brown (Ccbb)\n- 3 Plain Red (ccBB)\n- 1 Plain Brown (ccbb)\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. The F2 is derived from F1 selfing, which is CcBb. So, for each gene, the F2 will follow a 3:1 ratio.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n- 3/4 chance of dominant (C)\n- 1/4 chance of recessive (c)\n\nFor the second gene (B and b):\n- 3/4 chance of dominant (B)\n- 1/4 chance of recessive (b)\n\nSo, the four possible combinations are:\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n- Checkered Red: 9/16\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Red: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts assuming 16 birds:\n- 9 Checkered Red\n- 3 Checkered Brown\n- 3 Plain Red\n- 1 Plain Brown\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No, because our count is 9,3,3,1.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, matches.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Inverses of correct.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, inverses.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, which isn't our case.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Close but not exact.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal.\n\nThus, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds. One bird is homozygously checkered red (CC BB), and the other is plain brown (cc bb). They're crossing these two birds, and we need to create a Punnett square for their offspring. Then, based on that, determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. The dominant alleles are represented by uppercase letters, and the recessive ones by lowercase. So, for the first bird (checkered red), both parents have the genotype CC BB because they're homozygous. The second bird is plain brown, which would be cc bb since it's homozygous as well.\n\nNow, when you cross two heterozygotes (CcBb x CcBb), you get an F1 generation where each gene is independently assorting. Each parent contributes either C or c for the first gene and B or b for the second gene. So, the possible gametes from each parent are CB, Cb, cB, and cb. When these combine, the F1 will have all combinations except CC BB and cc bb, but wait\u2014no, actually, since both parents are CcBB and cc bb, the F1 should have all possible combinations, right? Wait, no. If one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, then the F1 should be CcBb because each parent can give either C or c for the first gene and B or b for the second gene. But since both parents are homozygous, the F1 will just be CcBb. Hmm, maybe I got confused earlier. Actually, if both parents are CcBB and cc bb, the F1 should be CcBb. But wait, the F1 itself might not necessarily be CcBb because each parent could produce different gametes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb. Since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, they'll produce gametes that carry either the dominant C and B or the recessive c and b. So, the F1 will have each combination except CC BB and cc bb. Therefore, the F1 will be CcBb.\n\nWait, no. Because CC BB is homozygous dominant, and cc bb is homozygous recessive. So, any bird that inherits at least one dominant allele from each parent will be CcBb. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So, the F1 will receive either C/c from the first gene and B/b from the second gene. So, each parent can contribute C or c, and B or b. So, the F1 will have all combinations except CC BB and cc bb. That means the F1 will be CcBb.\n\nBut wait, the F1 is supposed to be CcBb, meaning each gene is independently inherited. Now, moving on to the F2 generation. The F2 is generated from the F1 selfing (or from the F1 crossed with another F1). Since the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will involve the inheritance of each gene separately. Let's consider each gene individually.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n- Parental genotype: Cc (since F1 is CcBb)\n- The F2 will have a 3:1 ratio due to Mendel's law.\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (B and b):\n- Parental genotype: Bb (since F1 is CcBb)\n- The F2 will also have a 3:1 ratio.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio combined. However, the question asks about the phenotypic ratio considering both traits together. So, I need to look at how these genes interact.\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes. For the first gene (C and c):\n- Dominant C \u2192 Checkered\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n\nSecond gene (B and b):\n- Dominant B \u2192 Red\n- Recessive b \u2192 Brown\n\nSo, combining these:\n- If both genes are dominant: Checkered Red\n- First dominant, second recessive: Checkered Brown\n- First recessive, second dominant: Plain Red\n- Both recessive: Plain Brown\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n- 9/16 Checkered Red (both dominant)\n- 3/16 Checkered Brown (first dominant, second recessive)\n- 3/16 Plain Red (first recessive, second dominant)\n- 1/16 Plain Brown (both recessive)\n\nWait, no, the F2 will have a total of 16 possible outcomes. Let me calculate the actual numbers.\n\nFrom the previous calculation, the F2 will have:\n- 9 Checkered Red (CCBB)\n- 3 Checkered Brown (Ccbb)\n- 3 Plain Red (ccBB)\n- 1 Plain Brown (ccbb)\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. The F2 is derived from F1 selfing, which is CcBb. So, for each gene, the F2 will follow a 3:1 ratio.\n\nFor the first gene (C and c):\n- 3/4 chance of dominant (C)\n- 1/4 chance of recessive (c)\n\nFor the second gene (B and b):\n- 3/4 chance of dominant (B)\n- 1/4 chance of recessive (b)\n\nSo, the four possible combinations are:\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n- Checkered Red: 9/16\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16\n- Plain Red: 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 1/16\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts assuming 16 birds:\n- 9 Checkered Red\n- 3 Checkered Brown\n- 3 Plain Red\n- 1 Plain Brown\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No, because our count is 9,3,3,1.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, matches.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Inverses of correct.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, inverses.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, which isn't our case.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Close but not exact.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal.\n\nThus, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: There are two birds being crossed. One is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means its genotype is CC BB because both alleles are dominant for checkingered red. The other bird is a plain brown bird, so its genotype should be cc bb since both alleles are recessive for brown. \n\nNow, we're looking at an F2 generation from their crossed parents. Since each parent is heterozygous, their offspring will follow Mendel's laws. The F1 generation would be all the possible combinations of these genes. But here, the question focuses on the F2 generation.\n\nThe question asks about the Punnett square, showing phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. The options provided are A through H, with various ratios given.\n\nLet me start by determining the possible gametes each parent can produce. For the first parent (CC BB), since both alleles are dominant, it can only give one type of gamete: CB. So all F1 offspring will receive a CB allele from this parent.\n\nFor the second parent (cc bb), both alleles are recessive, so it can only give one gamete: cb. Again, all F1 offspring will have a cb allele from this parent.\n\nWait, but in F1, they all get CB from the first parent and cb from the second, making their genotype CcBb. That makes sense because each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nNow, when these F1 individuals (CcBb) mate, the F2 generation is formed. To find the phenotypes, I'll need to look at how each bird is colored based on the presence or absence of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nThe colors are determined by two genes: C (checkingered), c (plain) and B (red), b (brown). The phenotype is determined by whether a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nSo, for C (C_), the bird is checkingered. For c (cc), it's plain. For B (BB), it's red. For b (bb), it's brown.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on having at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it will be a checkered red bird. If it has at least one dominant C but not B, it's checkered brown. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant c but not B, it's plain red, and if it has neither dominant C nor c nor B nor b, it's plain brown.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the phenotype isn't just additive; it's more like a combination of both traits. Each bird must have at least one dominant allele for both C/B and c/b.\n\nSo, let's list the possible genotypes for the F2:\n\n- CcBb: Can have any combination of dominant and recessive.\nBut wait, that's not right. The F2 generation comes from crossing F1 individuals (CcBb) with another F1 individual (CcBb).\n\nTo determine the F2 genotypes, we need to consider the possible gametes from F1 (which are CcBb producing gametes with Cc and Bb). Wait, no, actually, F1 is CcBb, so each gamete will carry either C or c and either B or b. So the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb), each parent gives one gamete. So the F2 will have four combinations of gametes:\n\n1. CB x CB = CcBb (but wait, no\u2014each F1 produces gametes, so F2 will have combinations where each gene is from one parent or the other.)\n\nActually, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb. When F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb):\n\n- For the C locus: Each parent can contribute C or c. So the possible gametes are C (from parent 1) and c (from parent 2).\n- For the B locus: Each parent can contribute B or b. So the possible gametes are B (parent 1) and b (parent 2).\n\nThus, the F2 will have combinations:\n\n- Parent 1's C and B gamete + Parent 2's c and b gamete:\n  - Cc * Bb \u2192 CcBb\n- Parent 1's C and b + Parent 2's c and B:\n  - Cc * Bb \u2192 same as above?\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the Punnett square for F1 x F1 would look like:\n\n       |   C   |   c    |\n     ---|-------|-------|\n     Cc | Cc   | cc    |\n     Bb | Cc   | cc    |\n\nWait, no. Let's correct that. Each F1 bird is CcBb. So each gamete from F1 can be CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo when F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From Cc x Cc: CC (if both C), Cc (if one C and one c)\n- From Bb x Bb: BB (both B), Bb (one B and one b)\n\nBut considering both loci together, the F2 will have combinations where each gene is from one or the other parent. However, to simplify, since both parents are CcBb, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor each gene, the possible alleles are C and c, or B and b.\n\nBut without getting too bogged down, the key is to determine the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nFor the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red (CC_B_): Both dominant alleles present for C and B.\n- Checkered brown (CC_bb): Dominant C but recessive B.\n- Plain red (cc_B_): Dominant c but recessive B.\n- Plain brown (cc_bb): Neither dominant C nor c, nor B nor b.\n\nWait, no. Because in reality, for each gene independently, the presence of dominant allele results in the trait. So for C, presence of C results in checkingered, otherwise plain. For B, presence of B results in red, else brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether both dominant alleles are present for each trait.\n\nTherefore, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered red (C_ B_) if it has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B.\n- Checkered brown (C_ bb) if it has dominant C but no B.\n- Plain red (cc B_) if it has no C but has B.\n- Plain brown (cc bb) if it has neither C nor c nor B nor b.\n\nWait, no. It's not \"neither\"\u2014it's that the bird doesn't have any dominant alleles for either trait. So, for example, if a bird has no dominant C, then it's plain red regardless of B. Similarly, if it has no dominant B, it's plain brown regardless of C.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will result in specific phenotypes based on their combination of alleles.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can count how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nLooking back, the F2 generation will consist of 16 possible genotypic combinations, but some may combine into phenotypes due to dominance.\n\nHowever, given that the parents are CcBb, the F2 will have a certain distribution of genotypes leading to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\nParental genotypes: CcBb x CcBb\n\nPossible gametes for C locus: C and c\nPossible gametes for B locus: B and b\n\nSo the Punnett square will have 16 combinations, resulting in the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- 1 CC_BB (Checkered red)\n- 2 CC_Bb (Checkered brown)\n- 2 CC_bb (Plain red)\n- 2 Cc_BB (Checkered red)\n- 2 Cc_bb (Checkered brown)\n- 2 cC_BB (Plain red)\n- 2 cC_bb (Plain brown)\n- 2 cc_BB (Plain red)\n- 2 cc_bb (Plain brown)\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me recount.\n\nActually, each gene segregates independently, so the total number of phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red: C_ B_ \u2192 (C_)(B_) \u2192 4 cases? No, wait. Each gene has two possibilities, so for each gene, there are three possibilities: C_, Cc, cc; B_, Bb, bb.\n\nBut combining both, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n- C_ B_: Checkered red\n- C_ bb: Checkered brown\n- cc B_: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nEach combination of the two traits leads to one phenotype.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the F2 will have:\n\nNumber of Checkered red (C_ B_): (number of C_ * number of B_) = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 of the population.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown (C_ bb): (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nPlain red (cc B_): (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nPlain brown (cc bb): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nWait, no. Because for each gene, the probability of a dominant allele is 3/4 (since C and B are dominant), and recessive 1/4.\n\nBut when considering both genes, the probabilities multiply.\n\nSo:\n\n- C_ B_: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C_ bb: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc B_: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3.\n\nWait, my calculation shows 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly match that.

So the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, meaning 1 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 9 Plain red, 3 Plain brown. But none of the options exactly say that. Wait, looking back:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 9:3:3:1, which is different. Let me double-check.\n\nIf each gene segregates independently, the combined phenotypes would indeed have the product of the probabilities. For Checkered red (C_ B_), it's (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16. Checkered brown (C_ bb) is 3/16. Plain red (cc B_) is 3/16. Plain brown (cc bb) is 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut none of the options have 9:3:3:1. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which seems correct. Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the options include both the ratio and the explanation.\n\nIn the problem, the user provided several options with different ratios, including option C as 9:3:3:1. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, which states the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Because for each gene, the probability of a dominant allele is 3/4 (since C and B are dominant), and recessive 1/4.\n\nBut when considering both genes, the probabilities multiply.\n\nSo:\n\n- C_ B_: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C_ bb: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc B_: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3.\n\nWait, my calculation shows 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly match that. Let me see the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\n\nG. 12,2,2,0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nK.4,4,4,4\n\nL.3,9,1,3\n\nM.2,6,3,1\n\nN.6,2,2,2\n\nO.1,3,9,3\n\nP.4,4,4,4\n\nQ.5,3,2,6\n\nR.7,5,1,3\n\nS.2,6,3,1\n\nT.6,2,2,2\n\nU.4,4,4,4\n\nV.3,9,1,3\n\nW.5,3,2,6\n\nX.7,5,1,3\n\nY.2,6,3,1\n\nZ.4,4,4,4\n\nHmm, option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16, which matches our calculation. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, meaning 1 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 9 Plain red, 3 Plain brown. But none of the options exactly say that. Wait, looking back:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 9:3:3:1, which is different. Let me double-check.\n\nIf each gene segregates independently, the combined phenotypes would indeed have the product of the probabilities. For Checkered red (C_ B_), it's (3/4 * 3/4) = 9/16. Checkered brown (C_ bb) is 3/16. Plain red (cc B_) is 3/16. Plain brown (cc bb) is 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut none of the options have 9:3:3:1. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which seems correct. Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the options include both the ratio and the explanation.\n\nIn the problem, the user provided several options with different ratios, including option C as 9:3:3:1. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, which states the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves a cross between two birds: one that's a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and another that's plain brown (ccbb). They're asking about an A Punnett square for an dihybrid cross resulting in F2 generation. They want the phenotypic ratio based on checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the genes involved and their alleles. There are two pairs of genes here: one determining color (B for red, b for brown) and another determining dominance (C for checkered, c for plain).\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking back, the user mentioned four traits: C and c determine checkered vs plain color, B and b determine red vs brown. So each bird has two alleles for color and two for dominance.\n\nBut wait, the parents are both dihybrids? No, actually, they're monoallelic because one parent is homozygous CC BB and the other is cc bb. Wait, let me see:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2013 since CC means both Cs, and BB means both Bs. So the genotype is CC BB. Since C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, all these would be checkered red birds, right?\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2013 so both recessive alleles. That should result in plain brown birds because c is recessive for both genes and B is dominant for red.\n\nNow, when you cross these two birds, the F1 generation will be the combination of their gametes. Parent 1 can only produce gametes with C and B because it's homozygous. Parent 2 can only produce gametes with c and b because it's homozygous recessive.\n\nSo the F1 offspring will have all possible combinations: Cc (from Parent 1) and cc (from Parent 2), but wait, no\u2014the F1 from Parent 1 is CC and BB, which combine with cc and bb from Parent 2. So the F1 genotype would be CcBB ccBb? Wait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I confused something. Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, Parent 1 is CC BB, which produces gametes CC and BB. Parent 2 is cc bb, producing gametes cc and bb. So the F1 offspring would get one allele from each parent. So for each gene, the parents contribute either their own alleles.\n\nFor the color gene (B and b), Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b. So F1 will be Cc for the color gene, because Parent 1 contributes C and Parent 2 contributes c. Similarly, for the dominance gene (C and c), Parent 1 contributes C and Parent 2 contributes c. Wait, no\u2014wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so both Cs and both Bs. So the color gene is dominant, meaning all of Parent 1's color gene will express as C. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so all color gene will be c.\n\nSimilarly, for the dominance gene (C and c): Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So the F1 will be Cc for the dominance gene, meaning some will be C (dominant) and some will be c (recessive).\n\nWait, but the F1 individuals will all be Cc in terms of the color gene (since Parent 1 always gives B and Parent 2 gives b). And for the dominance gene, since Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b, the F1 will be Cc, meaning some will be C (red) and some will be c (plain).\n\nWait, but the F1s from crossing a CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous recessive) bird should all be Cc (for color) and Cc (for dominance). Because Parent 1 gives either C or B for the color gene, but since it's homozygous CC BB, all its gametes carry C for color and B for dominance. Wait, no\u2014it's homozygous for both, so all gametes are C and whatever the other allele is. But if Parent 1 is CC BB, then it must have two C's and two B's. So any gamete from it will carry either C or B? No, wait\u2014if the bird is CC BB, it's homozygous for both genes, so all gametes are C for color and B for dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing things. Let me clarify: Each bird has two alleles for each gene. Parent 1 is CC BB, so for the color gene, it's two C's, and for the dominance gene, two B's. Therefore, the gametes produced by Parent 1 will all carry C for color and B for dominance.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so gametes will carry c for color and b for dominance.\n\nWhen these two parents mate, the F1 generation will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. So for the color gene, Parent 1 provides C and Parent 2 provides c. For the dominance gene, Parent 1 provides B and Parent 2 provides b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 genotypes will be:\n\n- Color: C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2)\n- Dominance: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2)\n\nSo the F1 genotype is Cc Bb.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014wait, the F1 genotype would be Cc (from color) and Cc (from dominance), because Parent 1 contributes C and Parent 2 contributes c for color, and Parent 1 contributes B and Parent 2 contributes b for dominance. So yes, F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nSince C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, all these F1 birds will be checkered red.\n\nThen, the F1 plants are all checkered red. Now, they self-pollinate to form F2.\n\nIn F2, we'll look at the segregation patterns for both genes independently.\n\nLet's consider the color gene first. Parent 1 is Cc and Parent 2 is Cc. When they self-pollinate, what do they produce?\n\nFor the color gene (C and c), the F2 will follow a 3:1 ratio: 3 Cc and 1 CC.\n\nSimilarly, for the dominance gene (B and b), the F2 will also be 3 Bb and 1 BB.\n\nBecause both genes are segregating independently, the F2 phenotype ratio will be a product of the two independent ratios.\n\nSo for each trait:\n\n- Checkered: All Cc (since B doesn't affect color)\n- Plain: All Bb\n\nSo the F2 will have 3/4 checkered and 1/4 plain.\n\nWithin the checkered group, how many are red and how many are brown?\n\nEach bird has two alleles for color and two for dominance.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- For color: 3 Cc (so half C, half c) \u2192 half red, half plain.\n- For dominance: 3 Bb \u2192 half B, half b.\n\nSo the phenotypes will depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nBut wait, the F1 was all Cc Bb, so the F2 would be based on the same parents' F1, which were Cc Bb.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it too much. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (homozygous for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). They produce F1 by crossing, resulting in all Cc Bb.\n\nWhen F1 self-pollinates, each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor the color gene (C and c):\n\n- In F1, 50% are C (from Parent 1) and 50% are c (from Parent 2).\n- So in F2, for color:\n  - 25% CC (both dominant \u2192 checkered)\n  - 50% Cc (one dominant \u2192 checkered)\n  - 25% cc (both recessive \u2192 plain)\n  \nSimilarly, for the dominance gene (B and b):\n- 25% BB (both dominant \u2192 red)\n- 50% Bb (one dominant \u2192 red)\n- 25% bb (both recessive \u2192 brown)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the F2 phenotypes are a combination of these.\n\nNow, considering all combinations:\n\n- For color: 25% checkered, 25% plain.\n- For dominance: 25% red, 25% brown.\n\nSo the overall F2 phenotypes will be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of the population\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't match any of the options given. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, etc.\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 brown, etc.\nF. Equal distribution: 4 each.\nG. More checkered red.\nH. Different distribution.\nI. Another distribution.\n\nWait, my initial calculation suggested equal distribution, but none of the options reflect that exactly. However, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the F2 distribution properly.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Color (C and c): In F1 (Cc), the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio for color expression: 75% checkered, 25% plain.\n\nSimilarly, for dominance (B and b): 75% red, 25% brown.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined phenotype probabilities are the product of individual probabilities.\n\nThus, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nThese percentages correspond to fractions of the total population. To convert them into counts assuming 100 flies, multiply each percentage by 100:\n\n- Checkered red: ~56.25\n- Checkered brown: ~18.75\n- Plain red: ~18.75\n- Plain brown: ~6.25\n\nHowever, the options don't include exact decimal values. Let's look at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which seems low unless there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original assumption about F1 being Cc Bb is incorrect.\n\nWait, the F1 from CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous) is indeed Cc Bb. Then, F2 will be the F1 selfed, leading to the 3:1 ratio for each gene.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about dihybrid cross without considering the F1 being Cc Bb, but rather the parents being CC BB and cc bb. Wait, that might not make sense because CC BB and cc bb are homozygous for both genes, so their F1 would all be Cc Bb, and F2 would follow the 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents. Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which would mean all F1 are Cc Bb. Then, F2 would be 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9 phenotypic categories. But the options suggest smaller numbers like 6, 8, etc., which suggests perhaps a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are actually CC BB and cc bb, but that would lead to F1 being Cc Bb, and F2 having 9 categories. However, the options don't align with that. Alternatively, maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the F1 is actually Cc Bb, and F2 is the F1 selfed, leading to 12 possibilities.\n\nWait, let's try calculating the F2 correctly.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- For color (C and c): F2 has 3:1 ratio: 75% checkered, 25% plain.\n\n- For dominance (B and b): F2 has 3:1 ratio: 75% red, 25% brown.\n\nCombined, each phenotype is a combination of color and dominance:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nIf we assume 100 birds, the approximate numbers would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 56\n- Checkered brown: 19\n- Plain red: 19\n- Plain brown: 6\n\nBut none of the options match this. Looking at the options:\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Closest to plain red being 1, but actual is 6.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc. This matches roughly 25% of 12, but our calculation says ~18.75%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 sums to 16, which is less than 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the parents being CC BB and cc bb, but that leads to 12 phenotypes, but the options don't match.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits, but that wasn't stated here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the parents. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be as per above. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. Our calculation had 56, 19, 19, 6, totaling 100.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question intended a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since that's unlikely, I'll reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the F1 is actually Cc Bb, and F2 is the F1 selfed, giving a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to the following:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% of F2\n- Checkered brown: 25% of F2\n- Plain red: 25% of F2\n- Plain brown: 75% of F2\n\nBut this still doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the number of each phenotype directly. Assuming 16 birds (since 4^2=16), let's see:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% of 16 \u2248 12\n- Checkered brown: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Plain red: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Plain brown: 75% of 16 = 12\n\nTotal: 12 + 4 + 4 + 12 = 32, which is more than 16. So perhaps scaling down.\n\nAlternatively, using 100 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25\n- Checkered brown: 18.75\n- Plain red: 18.75\n- Plain brown: 6.25\n\nWhich simplifies to approximately 56, 19, 19, 6.\n\nLooking at the options, none match exactly, but Option D is 1,3,9,3. That's way lower. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18. Option F is 4 each, summing to 16.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the question intended a different setup, such as the parents being CC BB and cc bb, but the dihybrid cross is considered incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the choices, Option D may be the closest in proportion to the 25% chance of each phenotype, but scaled differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in counting the F2 ratios. Let's redo it.\n\nFor the color gene (C and c):\n\n- F1 (Cc): 50% C, 50% c\n- F2: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n  - So, 75% checkered, 25% plain\n\nFor dominance gene (B and b):\n\n- F1 (Bb): 50% B, 50% b\n- F2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n  - 75% red, 25% brown\n\nCombined:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAssuming 100 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: ~56\n- Checkered brown: ~19\n- Plain red: ~19\n- Plain brown: ~6\n\nNone of the options match exactly, but Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option F is 4 each, which is 16.\n\nGiven the calculations, the closest proportional distribution is Option D, but",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves a cross between two birds: one that's a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and another that's plain brown (ccbb). They're asking about an A Punnett square for an dihybrid cross resulting in F2 generation. They want the phenotypic ratio based on checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the genes involved and their alleles. There are two pairs of genes here: one determining color (B for red, b for brown) and another determining dominance (C for checkered, c for plain).\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking back, the user mentioned four traits: C and c determine checkered vs plain color, B and b determine red vs brown. So each bird has two alleles for color and two for dominance.\n\nBut wait, the parents are both dihybrids? No, actually, they're monoallelic because one parent is homozygous CC BB and the other is cc bb. Wait, let me see:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2013 since CC means both Cs, and BB means both Bs. So the genotype is CC BB. Since C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, all these would be checkered red birds, right?\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2013 so both recessive alleles. That should result in plain brown birds because c is recessive for both genes and B is dominant for red.\n\nNow, when you cross these two birds, the F1 generation will be the combination of their gametes. Parent 1 can only produce gametes with C and B because it's homozygous. Parent 2 can only produce gametes with c and b because it's homozygous recessive.\n\nSo the F1 offspring will have all possible combinations: Cc (from Parent 1) and cc (from Parent 2), but wait, no\u2014the F1 from Parent 1 is CC and BB, which combine with cc and bb from Parent 2. So the F1 genotype would be CcBB ccBb? Wait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I confused something. Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, Parent 1 is CC BB, which produces gametes CC and BB. Parent 2 is cc bb, producing gametes cc and bb. So the F1 offspring would get one allele from each parent. So for each gene, the parents contribute either their own alleles.\n\nFor the color gene (B and b), Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b. So F1 will be Cc for the color gene, because Parent 1 contributes C and Parent 2 contributes c. Similarly, for the dominance gene (C and c), Parent 1 contributes C and Parent 2 contributes c. Wait, no\u2014wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so both Cs and both Bs. So the color gene is dominant, meaning all of Parent 1's color gene will express as C. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so all color gene will be c.\n\nSimilarly, for the dominance gene (C and c): Parent 1 contributes B, Parent 2 contributes b. So the F1 will be Cc for the dominance gene, meaning some will be C (dominant) and some will be c (recessive).\n\nWait, but the F1 individuals will all be Cc in terms of the color gene (since Parent 1 always gives B and Parent 2 gives b). And for the dominance gene, since Parent 1 gives B and Parent 2 gives b, the F1 will be Cc, meaning some will be C (red) and some will be c (plain).\n\nWait, but the F1s from crossing a CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous recessive) bird should all be Cc (for color) and Cc (for dominance). Because Parent 1 gives either C or B for the color gene, but since it's homozygous CC BB, all its gametes carry C for color and B for dominance. Wait, no\u2014it's homozygous for both, so all gametes are C and whatever the other allele is. But if Parent 1 is CC BB, then it must have two C's and two B's. So any gamete from it will carry either C or B? No, wait\u2014if the bird is CC BB, it's homozygous for both genes, so all gametes are C for color and B for dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm confusing things. Let me clarify: Each bird has two alleles for each gene. Parent 1 is CC BB, so for the color gene, it's two C's, and for the dominance gene, two B's. Therefore, the gametes produced by Parent 1 will all carry C for color and B for dominance.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so gametes will carry c for color and b for dominance.\n\nWhen these two parents mate, the F1 generation will receive one allele from each parent for each gene. So for the color gene, Parent 1 provides C and Parent 2 provides c. For the dominance gene, Parent 1 provides B and Parent 2 provides b.\n\nTherefore, the F1 genotypes will be:\n\n- Color: C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2)\n- Dominance: B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2)\n\nSo the F1 genotype is Cc Bb.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014wait, the F1 genotype would be Cc (from color) and Cc (from dominance), because Parent 1 contributes C and Parent 2 contributes c for color, and Parent 1 contributes B and Parent 2 contributes b for dominance. So yes, F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nSince C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, all these F1 birds will be checkered red.\n\nThen, the F1 plants are all checkered red. Now, they self-pollinate to form F2.\n\nIn F2, we'll look at the segregation patterns for both genes independently.\n\nLet's consider the color gene first. Parent 1 is Cc and Parent 2 is Cc. When they self-pollinate, what do they produce?\n\nFor the color gene (C and c), the F2 will follow a 3:1 ratio: 3 Cc and 1 CC.\n\nSimilarly, for the dominance gene (B and b), the F2 will also be 3 Bb and 1 BB.\n\nBecause both genes are segregating independently, the F2 phenotype ratio will be a product of the two independent ratios.\n\nSo for each trait:\n\n- Checkered: All Cc (since B doesn't affect color)\n- Plain: All Bb\n\nSo the F2 will have 3/4 checkered and 1/4 plain.\n\nWithin the checkered group, how many are red and how many are brown?\n\nEach bird has two alleles for color and two for dominance.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- For color: 3 Cc (so half C, half c) \u2192 half red, half plain.\n- For dominance: 3 Bb \u2192 half B, half b.\n\nSo the phenotypes will depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nBut wait, the F1 was all Cc Bb, so the F2 would be based on the same parents' F1, which were Cc Bb.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it too much. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (homozygous for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). They produce F1 by crossing, resulting in all Cc Bb.\n\nWhen F1 self-pollinates, each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor the color gene (C and c):\n\n- In F1, 50% are C (from Parent 1) and 50% are c (from Parent 2).\n- So in F2, for color:\n  - 25% CC (both dominant \u2192 checkered)\n  - 50% Cc (one dominant \u2192 checkered)\n  - 25% cc (both recessive \u2192 plain)\n  \nSimilarly, for the dominance gene (B and b):\n- 25% BB (both dominant \u2192 red)\n- 50% Bb (one dominant \u2192 red)\n- 25% bb (both recessive \u2192 brown)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the F2 phenotypes are a combination of these.\n\nNow, considering all combinations:\n\n- For color: 25% checkered, 25% plain.\n- For dominance: 25% red, 25% brown.\n\nSo the overall F2 phenotypes will be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of the population\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't match any of the options given. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, etc.\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 brown, etc.\nF. Equal distribution: 4 each.\nG. More checkered red.\nH. Different distribution.\nI. Another distribution.\n\nWait, my initial calculation suggested equal distribution, but none of the options reflect that exactly. However, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the F2 distribution properly.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Color (C and c): In F1 (Cc), the F2 will have a 3:1 ratio for color expression: 75% checkered, 25% plain.\n\nSimilarly, for dominance (B and b): 75% red, 25% brown.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined phenotype probabilities are the product of individual probabilities.\n\nThus, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nThese percentages correspond to fractions of the total population. To convert them into counts assuming 100 flies, multiply each percentage by 100:\n\n- Checkered red: ~56.25\n- Checkered brown: ~18.75\n- Plain red: ~18.75\n- Plain brown: ~6.25\n\nHowever, the options don't include exact decimal values. Let's look at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which seems low unless there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original assumption about F1 being Cc Bb is incorrect.\n\nWait, the F1 from CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous) is indeed Cc Bb. Then, F2 will be the F1 selfed, leading to the 3:1 ratio for each gene.\n\nBut perhaps the question is about dihybrid cross without considering the F1 being Cc Bb, but rather the parents being CC BB and cc bb. Wait, that might not make sense because CC BB and cc bb are homozygous for both genes, so their F1 would all be Cc Bb, and F2 would follow the 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents. Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which would mean all F1 are Cc Bb. Then, F2 would be 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9 phenotypic categories. But the options suggest smaller numbers like 6, 8, etc., which suggests perhaps a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are actually CC BB and cc bb, but that would lead to F1 being Cc Bb, and F2 having 9 categories. However, the options don't align with that. Alternatively, maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the F1 is actually Cc Bb, and F2 is the F1 selfed, leading to 12 possibilities.\n\nWait, let's try calculating the F2 correctly.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- For color (C and c): F2 has 3:1 ratio: 75% checkered, 25% plain.\n\n- For dominance (B and b): F2 has 3:1 ratio: 75% red, 25% brown.\n\nCombined, each phenotype is a combination of color and dominance:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nIf we assume 100 birds, the approximate numbers would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 56\n- Checkered brown: 19\n- Plain red: 19\n- Plain brown: 6\n\nBut none of the options match this. Looking at the options:\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Closest to plain red being 1, but actual is 6.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc. This matches roughly 25% of 12, but our calculation says ~18.75%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 sums to 16, which is less than 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the parents being CC BB and cc bb, but that leads to 12 phenotypes, but the options don't match.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits, but that wasn't stated here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the parents. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be as per above. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, looking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. Our calculation had 56, 19, 19, 6, totaling 100.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question intended a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since that's unlikely, I'll reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the F1 is actually Cc Bb, and F2 is the F1 selfed, giving a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to the following:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% of F2\n- Checkered brown: 25% of F2\n- Plain red: 25% of F2\n- Plain brown: 75% of F2\n\nBut this still doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the number of each phenotype directly. Assuming 16 birds (since 4^2=16), let's see:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% of 16 \u2248 12\n- Checkered brown: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Plain red: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Plain brown: 75% of 16 = 12\n\nTotal: 12 + 4 + 4 + 12 = 32, which is more than 16. So perhaps scaling down.\n\nAlternatively, using 100 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25\n- Checkered brown: 18.75\n- Plain red: 18.75\n- Plain brown: 6.25\n\nWhich simplifies to approximately 56, 19, 19, 6.\n\nLooking at the options, none match exactly, but Option D is 1,3,9,3. That's way lower. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18. Option F is 4 each, summing to 16.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the question intended a different setup, such as the parents being CC BB and cc bb, but the dihybrid cross is considered incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the choices, Option D may be the closest in proportion to the 25% chance of each phenotype, but scaled differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in counting the F2 ratios. Let's redo it.\n\nFor the color gene (C and c):\n\n- F1 (Cc): 50% C, 50% c\n- F2: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n  - So, 75% checkered, 25% plain\n\nFor dominance gene (B and b):\n\n- F1 (Bb): 50% B, 50% b\n- F2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n  - 75% red, 25% brown\n\nCombined:\n\n- Checkered red: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Checkered brown: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAssuming 100 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: ~56\n- Checkered brown: ~19\n- Plain red: ~19\n- Plain brown: ~6\n\nNone of the options match exactly, but Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option F is 4 each, which is 16.\n\nGiven the calculations, the closest proportional distribution is Option D, but",

    "rollout": " It's about a dihybrid cross involving birds with different colored patterns controlled by certain genes. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the plain color is from the recessive allele c. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele C means the bird has the checkered pattern, which is dominant over plain c. That makes sense because C is dominant.\n\nNext, there are two other traits: red color is determined by a dominant gene B, and brown is determined by the recessive allele b. Wait, but how do these interact? If both B and b are involved in determining color, then perhaps having at least one B results in red color, and any b would make it brown. But if a bird has both B and b alleles, what happens? Oh, wait, no\u2014each trait is typically determined separately unless they're linked, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe each trait is independent, or perhaps they're on the same chromosome. Hmm, but since the problem doesn't specify linkage, I think it's assuming independent assortment. Alternatively, perhaps both traits are influenced by the same set of genes.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. It says the checkered pattern is C, plain is c, red is B, and brown is b. So, each bird has four genes: C, c for the pattern, and B, b for color. Or maybe each bird has two loci: one for pattern (C/c) and another for color (B/b). So, for example, a bird could have the genotype Cc for the pattern and BB for color, leading to checkered red, orCc with Bb, resulting in checkered brown, etc.\n\nNow, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So, the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous for both pattern and color. Pattern: CC, Color: BB \u2192 Genotype: CCBB.\n- Parent 2: Plain (cc) and brown (bb) \u2192 Genotype: ccbb.\n\nThe Punnett square will be based on these gametes. Since the parents are homozygous for some traits, all their gametes will carry those alleles.\n\nSo, Parent 1 can only produce gametes with CC (since CCBB \u2192 gametes are C), and Parent 2 can only produce gametes with bb (since ccbb \u2192 gametes are b).\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of CC and bb, so F1 genotypes are CcBb.\n\nThen, we need to look at the F2 generation after selfing. So, each F1 individual (CcBb) will produce gametes according to Mendel's laws. For each locus (C and B), the gametes will be:\n\nFor C locus:\n- From CC: C\n- From Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n\nFor B locus:\n- From BB: B\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSince the loci are assumed to assort independently, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut let's consider the phenotypes first. Each bird has two traits: pattern (C vs c) and color (B vs b). So, the phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nPattern (C): Checkered (dominant)\nColor (B):\n- Red (dominant)\n- Brown (recessive)\n\nSo, possible phenotypes:\n- Checkered red\n- Checkered brown\n\nBecause to express both traits, you need at least one dominant allele for each. For example, if an individual has Cc for pattern and BB for color, they'll be Checkered red. Similarly, Cc for pattern and Bb for color will be Checkered brown.\n\nWait, but if a bird is CcBb, that's already showing both traits. However, if someone is CCbb, they'll be Checkered brown because they have C for pattern (so not plain) and b for color (brown). Similarly, ccBB would be plain red, and ccBb would be plain brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is CCbb, it's C (so pattern is checkered) and b (so color is brown). So the phenotype is Checkered brown. Similarly, ccBB would be c (plain) and B (red), so Checkered red. ccBb would be c (plain) and b (brown), so plain brown. And ccbb would be plain and plain, but since it's homozygous for both, actually, it depends on the interaction. Wait, no\u2014the question states the birds are either checkered red or plain brown. But when combining, the color is determined by whether the bird has at least one B (for red) or b (for brown). So, if a bird is CCbb, it's C (pattern) and b (color), so it's Checkered brown. Similarly, ccBB is c (plain) and B (red), so plain red. ccBb is c (plain) and b (brown), plain brown. And ccbb is plain and plain, but since they're homozygous, does that affect anything? Actually, the question doesn't mention this case, so perhaps it's not considered.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes should be:\n\n- Checkered red: All individuals where the bird is C (pattern) and B (color). This includes CCBB, CCBb, CcBB, CcBb.\n- Checkered brown: Individuals where C is present (so not plain) but b is present (so brown). This includes CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb.\n- Plain red: Individuals where c (plain) and B (red). This includes ccBB, ccBb.\n- Plain brown: Individuals where c (plain) and b (brown). This includes ccbb, ccBb.\n\nWait, but looking back, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but considering only the four phenotypes as above. Let me count the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (for two traits), the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each of the four phenotypes. However, depending on dominance, some might combine into fewer categories. In this case, since both traits are dominant, all four phenotypes are distinct.\n\nWait, no\u2014in our case, the four phenotypes are defined as:\n\n1. Checkered red (CCBB, CCBb, CcBB, CcBb)\n2. Checkered brown (CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb)\n3. Plain red (ccBB, ccBb)\n4. Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nSo, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 of F2\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16/16 = 1.\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up correctly (1+3+9+3=16). But wait, that seems off because the Checkered brown should be 3 parts, and plain red also 3 parts. But in reality, Checkered red is 9, Checkered brown is 3, Plain red is 3, and Plain brown is 1. So option D matches exactly.\n\nAlternatively, option H has checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That sums to 16, but the proportions don't match. Option G has checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't add to 16. Option A has 6:2:6:2, which is half of 16. So none seem correct except option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The F2 from a dihybrid cross has a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but when considering the specific phenotypes, each category corresponds to one of the four possibilities. So the actual numbers would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 of total\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nThus, in terms of the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total, it's 9:3:3:1. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the four options, so option D matches 1:3:9:3, which is the same as 1:3:9:3 but inverted for the last term. Wait, no\u2014the question lists them as checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. So adding them gives 1+3+9+3=16, which fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio.

But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the four options, so option D matches 1:3:9:3, which is the same as 1:3:9:3 but inverted for the last term. Wait, no\u2014the question lists them as checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. So adding them gives 1+3+9+3=16, which fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, the answer is D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves two birds crossing in an adihybridcross. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). The traits are governed by two genes, C and B. Gene C is responsible for checkered versus plain color, and gene B determines whether the bird is red or brown.\n\nThe question asks about the Punnett square for the F2 generation and provides several options for the phenotypic ratio. I need to determine which option is correct.\n\nLet me start by understanding the parents:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red (CC BB)\n  - Since both alleles are C and B, and the bird is red, this means they're homozygous for both dominant traits.\n- Parent 2: Plain brown (cc bb)\n  - Both alleles are recessive, so the bird is plain and brown.\n\nSo, when these two parents mate, we can create the F1 generation by considering the possible gametes each can produce.\n\nParent 1 can only produce gametes that carry the dominant alleles C and B because it's homozygous. So, all gametes from Parent 1 will be CB.\n\nParent 2 can only produce gametes that carry the recessive alleles c and b because it's homozygous. So, all gametes from Parent 2 will be cb.\n\nNow, when these two parents (each producing only one type of gamete) cross each other, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of their gametes. However, since Parent 1 produces only CB and Parent 2 produces only cb, the F1 should be Cc Bb (because CB + cb = Cc Bb).\n\nWait, but actually, no\u2014wait a second. Each parent contributes only one type of gamete. So, the F1 would have gametes from Parent 1 (CB) and Parent 2 (cb), making F1 as CB and cb. But wait, if Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then their offspring would receive one allele from each parent. So, the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nBut let me think again. If Parent 1 is CC BB, they can only give either C or B? Wait, no\u2014the notation might be confusing. In bird genetics, uppercase letters usually represent dominant alleles, and lowercase recessive. So, CC BB would mean both alleles are dominant for both genes. Similarly, cc bb would mean both recessive.\n\nWhen two birds mate, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So, for the first gene (gene C):\n\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 can only contribute C\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 must contribute c\n\nSo, all F1 will get C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, giving genotype Cc for gene C.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 can only contribute B\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 must contribute b\n\nSo, all F1 will get B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, giving genotype Bb for gene B.\n\nThus, all F1 individuals are Cc Bb, meaning they're heterozygous for both genes. Their phenotype would be red and checkered because they are B (red) and C (checkered). Since both are present, the phenotype would be red and checkered.\n\nMoving on to F2 generation. To find the F2 phenotypic ratio, I need to consider the dihybrid cross of the F1 generation. The F1 is Cc Bb. When crossed with itself (Cc Bb x Cc Bb), the possible offspring will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under Mendelian inheritance.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't include a 9:3:3:1 ratio directly, but some combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the dihybrid cross but simplifies the analysis.\n\nWait, the question says \"phenotypic ratio\" for the F2 generation. Let me calculate the expected phenotypes based on the F1 being Cc Bb.\n\nEach gene independently assorts, so the segregation for gene C is independent of gene B.\n\nFor gene C:\n\n- C (from F1) can come from either parent.\n\nPossible gametes from F1 are C and c (but since F1 is Cc, the distribution is 50% C and 50% c).\n\nSame for gene B:\n\n- B and b.\n\nSo, the F2 will have four combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible phenotypes. However, many will combine into the same phenotype.\n\nBut the options given seem to group them into categories like checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of both dominant and recessive alleles in each gene.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes' phenotypes.\n\nWait, let's clarify the actual phenotypes based on the genes:\n\n- Gene C: Checkered (C) vs. plain (c)\n- Gene B: Red (B) vs. brown (b)\n\nSo, combining both, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nNow, using a Punnett square approach, let's map the F1 (Cc Bb) selfed to find the F2.\n\nEach gene segregates independently.\n\nFor gene C:\n\n- C can pass C or c (50% each)\n- c can pass c or C (50% each)\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- B can pass B or b (50% each)\n- b can pass b or B (50% each)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombined, there are 16 possible combinations. Now, let's determine how many result in each phenotype.\n\nCheckered red (C_B_): Occurs when C is present (at least one C) and B is present (at least one B).\n- Probability: (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- Phenotype: Checkered red\n\nCheckered brown (C_bb): Occurs when C is present (at least one C) and B is absent (no B).\n- Probability: (50% C) * (50% b) = 25%\n- Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\nPlain red (cc_B_): Occurs when c is present (at least one c) and B is present (at least one B).\n- Probability: (50% c) * (50% B) = 25%\n- Phenotype: Plain red\n\nPlain brown (cc_bb): Occurs when c is present (at least one c) and B is absent (no B).\n- Probability: (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n- Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nAdding these up: 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%, which makes sense.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match my calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The F2 population has four phenotypes, each with equal probability of 25%. So, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option H is: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype rather than the ratio. Or maybe the options are mislabeled.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the overall F2 ratio but specific genotypic or phenotypic counts.\n\nLet me look at the options more carefully.\n\nOption A: 6,2,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't make sense.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16, but individual numbers don't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but doesn't match.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal distribution, which matches 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, yes! Because each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, so if you count the number of each phenotype in a large population, each should occur approximately equally. So, 4 out of 16 birds would be each phenotype, which is 1:1:1:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be F: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nF.

They want me to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation and determine the phenotypic ratios based on the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the genetic information provided. Each bird has two alleles for each trait, which are determined by genes C and c (dominant and recessive respectively), and B and b (dominant and recessive respectively).\n\nLooking at the parents:\n- Parent 1 is CCBB. So both alleles are dominant for both traits.\n- Parent 2 is ccbb. Both alleles are recessive for both traits.\n\nSince they're crossing these two birds, their offspring will be F1. But wait, actually, the question mentions F2 generation, so maybe I need to consider multiple generations beyond F1.\n\nWait no, the initial setup says \"adahybridcross,\" but then the gamete descriptions go up to F1. Hmm, perhaps I misread. Let me look back.\n\nOh, the user mentioned creating a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, the Gametes include CB, cb, etc., leading up to F1 and F2. So I think the user wants the F2 generation's Punnett square created from the cross described in the gametes part.\n\nWait, the initial description seems to have multiple steps:\n\n1. The parents are CCBB and ccbb.\n2. Gametes for the first cross are listed as CB, cb.\n3. Then, the next set includes F1 and F2.\n\nSo perhaps the initial description is about setting up the crosses, not the actual question. Maybe the real question is just about an adhybrid Cross between CCBB and ccbb, resulting in F2, and determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nBut let me clarify. The problem states: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adhybrid means hybrid, so it's a cross between two different species or different genotypes. In this case, the parents are CCBB and ccbb.\n\nEach parent contributes gametes. Since both are purebreeds (no variation), all gametes from CCBB would be CB, because both alleles are dominant. From ccbb, all gametes would be cb, since both alleles are recessive.\n\nSo the F1 generation would consist of all possible combinations of these gametes: CB and cb. Therefore, the F1 genotype would be CcBb.\n\nNow, considering that F1 are going to self-pollinate to produce F2. Wait, but in the initial description, the F1 gametes are listed as (CB) (cb), which makes sense because you can't get any other combination from CCBB and ccbb.\n\nThen, when F1 (CcBb) self-pollinates, the F2 generation would result from combining the gametes of F1. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb\u2014wait, no, actually, for each gene, there are two possibilities, so the F2 would have each gene pair recombinating if there's crossover.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the parents are homozygous for both genes, there should be no recombination during meiosis, right? Because the parents don't have any heterozygotes. So all F2 would be non-recombinant.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotype would be CcBb x CcBb, and each gene is independent, so the Punnett square would be:\n\n```\n  | C | c\n---+---+---\n C | CC | Cc\n---+---+---\n B | Cb | cc\n---+---+---\n b | Cb | cc\n```\n\nWait, no, more accurately, each gene is considered separately. The first gene is C/c, second is B/b.\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\nParent is CC, so all gametes are C.\nFor the second gene (B/b):\nParent is BB, so all gametes are B.\n\nTherefore, F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB, CB, CB, CB? No, wait, each gene is separate, so the F1 individual is CcBb, meaning for each gene, half are dominant and half recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently.\n\nFor each gene, the F1 bird is Cc (since the parent was CC, which is dominant) and Bb (parent was BB, also dominant). Wait, no: CCBB is homozygous dominant for both traits, so for each gene, the bird has two dominant alleles.\n\nWhen selfing, each gene's allele will segregate independently. So for the C gene, the parent is CC (all C), so F1 will be Cc (but wait, no, the bird is CcBb, so for each gene, the alleles are C and c.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each trait.\n\nFor the C/B locus:\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 both C and B are dominant, so alleles are CC and BB.\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 both c and b are recessive, so alleles are cc and bb.\n\nWhen crossing CCBB and ccbb, each bird produces gametes based on their own alleles. Since CCBB is homozygous dominant, all gametes from this bird will be CB (C from CC and B from BB). Similarly, ccbb produces only cb gametes.\n\nThus, F1 (from CCBB x ccbb) will be CcBb, as they receive one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nNow, F1 is CcBb, which self-pollinates. So for each gene, the F1 bird can produce gametes C or c for C, and B or b for B.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have all combinations of Cc x Bb.\n\nThe Punnett square for Cc x Bb would be:\n\n```\n   | C | c\n---+---+---\n C | CC | Cc\n---+---+---\n B | Cc | cc\n---+---+---\n b | Cc | cc\n```\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc for the first gene; and same for the second gene.\n\nNow, we need to translate these genotypes into phenotypes based on the dominance rules.\n\nDominance is determined as follows:\n- For C/B:\n  - Dominant: C or B\n  - Recessive: cc and bb\n\nSimilarly,\n- For c/b:\n  - Dominant: c or b\n  - Recessive: CC and BB\n\nWait, no. The dominance is given as:\n- Checkered pattern: C is dominant (so presence of C leads to checkered, presence of c leads to plain).\n- Red color: B is dominant (presence of B leads to red, presence of b leads to brown).\n\nWait, the question says:\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by dominant gene C; plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene B; brown by recessive b.\n\nSo for the first trait (checkered vs plain), C is dominant, so presence of C results in checkered, c results in plain.\n\nFor the second trait (red vs brown), B is dominant, so presence of B results in red, b results in brown.\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on both traits.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations:\n\n1. Checkered (C present) and Red (B present): Checkered red\n2. Checkered (C present) and Brown (b present): Checkered brown\n3. Plain (c present) and Red (B present): Plain red\n4. Plain (c present) and Brown (b present): Plain brown\n\nNow, let's see what the F2 genotypes correspond to.\n\nFrom the Punnett square above, the F2 genotypes for the C/B locus are:\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain red\nSimilarly, for the c/b locus:\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain brown\n\nSo each genotype corresponds to one phenotype.\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment), the F2 ratio for two traits with dominant-recessive relationships is 9:3:3:1 for the four possible combinations of dominance.\n\nWait, but since each trait is controlled by a separate pair, the overall F2 ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for the combined traits.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Each gene is independent, so for two traits, the F2 ratio is 9 (Checkered red) + 3 (Checkered brown) + 3 (Plain red) + 1 (Plain brown) = total 16.\n\nSo the breakdown would be:\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up because 1+3+9+3=16, which matches.\n\nOption H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That sums to 16 but isn't matching the correct distribution.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, but incorrect distribution.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also sum to 16, but incorrect proportions.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.

Sum to 16, but incorrect.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum to 16, but checkered brown is 3, whereas correct is 3 for brown, so that's correct except for the order.\n\nWait, option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up correctly, and the proportions match the 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but hold on. The F2 ratio for two traits with dominant-recessive relationships is indeed 9:3:3:1. So option C matches that.\n\nBut looking back, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the F2, each trait is determined independently. So for the C/B locus, the phenotypes are:\n- Checkered red (C present, B present)\n- Checkered brown (C present, b present)\n- Plain red (c present, B present)\n- Plain brown (c present, b present)\n\nThe number of each phenotype in F2 is:\n- Checkered red: (number of CC + Cc + cc) for the C/B locus multiplied by (number of BB + Bb + bb) for the c/b locus. Wait, no, each gene is independent, so the phenotypes are additive.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio for two independent traits.\n\nYes, so the correct option is C, which lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves an adihybridcross between two birds: one that's homozygously checkered red (CCBB) and another that's plain brown (ccbb). They want me to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation and determine the phenotypic ratios based on the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the genetic information provided. Each bird has two alleles for each trait, which are determined by genes C and c (dominant and recessive respectively), and B and b (dominant and recessive respectively).\n\nLooking at the parents:\n- Parent 1 is CCBB. So both alleles are dominant for both traits.\n- Parent 2 is ccbb. Both alleles are recessive for both traits.\n\nSince they're crossing these two birds, their offspring will be F1. But wait, actually, the question mentions F2 generation, so maybe I need to consider multiple generations beyond F1.\n\nWait no, the initial setup says \"adahybridcross,\" but then the gamete descriptions go up to F1. Hmm, perhaps I misread. Let me look back.\n\nOh, the user mentioned creating a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, the Gametes include CB, cb, etc., leading up to F1 and F2. So I think the user wants the F2 generation's Punnett square created from the cross described in the gametes part.\n\nWait, the initial description seems to have multiple steps:\n\n1. The parents are CCBB and ccbb.\n2. Gametes for the first cross are listed as CB, cb.\n3. Then, the next set includes F1 and F2.\n\nSo perhaps the initial description is about setting up the crosses, not the actual question. Maybe the real question is just about an adhybrid Cross between CCBB and ccbb, resulting in F2, and determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nBut let me clarify. The problem states: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adhybrid means hybrid, so it's a cross between two different species or different genotypes. In this case, the parents are CCBB and ccbb.\n\nEach parent contributes gametes. Since both are purebreeds (no variation), all gametes from CCBB would be CB, because both alleles are dominant. From ccbb, all gametes would be cb, since both alleles are recessive.\n\nSo the F1 generation would consist of all possible combinations of these gametes: CB and cb. Therefore, the F1 genotype would be CcBb.\n\nNow, considering that F1 are going to self-pollinate to produce F2. Wait, but in the initial description, the F1 gametes are listed as (CB) (cb), which makes sense because you can't get any other combination from CCBB and ccbb.\n\nThen, when F1 (CcBb) self-pollinates, the F2 generation would result from combining the gametes of F1. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb\u2014wait, no, actually, for each gene, there are two possibilities, so the F2 would have each gene pair recombinating if there's crossover.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the parents are homozygous for both genes, there should be no recombination during meiosis, right? Because the parents don't have any heterozygotes. So all F2 would be non-recombinant.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotype would be CcBb x CcBb, and each gene is independent, so the Punnett square would be:\n\n```\n  | C | c\n---+---+---\n C | CC | Cc\n---+---+---\n B | Cb | cc\n---+---+---\n b | Cb | cc\n```\n\nWait, no, more accurately, each gene is considered separately. The first gene is C/c, second is B/b.\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\nParent is CC, so all gametes are C.\nFor the second gene (B/b):\nParent is BB, so all gametes are B.\n\nTherefore, F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB, CB, CB, CB? No, wait, each gene is separate, so the F1 individual is CcBb, meaning for each gene, half are dominant and half recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently.\n\nFor each gene, the F1 bird is Cc (since the parent was CC, which is dominant) and Bb (parent was BB, also dominant). Wait, no: CCBB is homozygous dominant for both traits, so for each gene, the bird has two dominant alleles.\n\nWhen selfing, each gene's allele will segregate independently. So for the C gene, the parent is CC (all C), so F1 will be Cc (but wait, no, the bird is CcBb, so for each gene, the alleles are C and c.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each trait.\n\nFor the C/B locus:\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 both C and B are dominant, so alleles are CC and BB.\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 both c and b are recessive, so alleles are cc and bb.\n\nWhen crossing CCBB and ccbb, each bird produces gametes based on their own alleles. Since CCBB is homozygous dominant, all gametes from this bird will be CB (C from CC and B from BB). Similarly, ccbb produces only cb gametes.\n\nThus, F1 (from CCBB x ccbb) will be CcBb, as they receive one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nNow, F1 is CcBb, which self-pollinates. So for each gene, the F1 bird can produce gametes C or c for C, and B or b for B.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have all combinations of Cc x Bb.\n\nThe Punnett square for Cc x Bb would be:\n\n```\n   | C | c\n---+---+---\n C | CC | Cc\n---+---+---\n B | Cc | cc\n---+---+---\n b | Cc | cc\n```\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc for the first gene; and same for the second gene.\n\nNow, we need to translate these genotypes into phenotypes based on the dominance rules.\n\nDominance is determined as follows:\n- For C/B:\n  - Dominant: C or B\n  - Recessive: cc and bb\n\nSimilarly,\n- For c/b:\n  - Dominant: c or b\n  - Recessive: CC and BB\n\nWait, no. The dominance is given as:\n- Checkered pattern: C is dominant (so presence of C leads to checkered, presence of c leads to plain).\n- Red color: B is dominant (presence of B leads to red, presence of b leads to brown).\n\nWait, the question says:\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by dominant gene C; plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene B; brown by recessive b.\n\nSo for the first trait (checkered vs plain), C is dominant, so presence of C results in checkered, c results in plain.\n\nFor the second trait (red vs brown), B is dominant, so presence of B results in red, b results in brown.\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on both traits.\n\nLet's list the possible combinations:\n\n1. Checkered (C present) and Red (B present): Checkered red\n2. Checkered (C present) and Brown (b present): Checkered brown\n3. Plain (c present) and Red (B present): Plain red\n4. Plain (c present) and Brown (b present): Plain brown\n\nNow, let's see what the F2 genotypes correspond to.\n\nFrom the Punnett square above, the F2 genotypes for the C/B locus are:\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain red\nSimilarly, for the c/b locus:\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain brown\n\nSo each genotype corresponds to one phenotype.\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment), the F2 ratio for two traits with dominant-recessive relationships is 9:3:3:1 for the four possible combinations of dominance.\n\nWait, but since each trait is controlled by a separate pair, the overall F2 ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for the combined traits.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Each gene is independent, so for two traits, the F2 ratio is 9 (Checkered red) + 3 (Checkered brown) + 3 (Plain red) + 1 (Plain brown) = total 16.\n\nSo the breakdown would be:\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up because 1+3+9+3=16, which matches.\n\nOption H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That sums to 16 but isn't matching the correct distribution.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, but incorrect distribution.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also sum to 16, but incorrect proportions.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Sum is 16, but the proportions are equal instead of following 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Sum to 16, but incorrect proportion.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Sum to 16, but incorrect.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum to 16, but checkered brown is 3, whereas correct is 3 for brown, so that's correct except for the order.\n\nWait, option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up correctly, and the proportions match the 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but hold on. The F2 ratio for two traits with dominant-recessive relationships is indeed 9:3:3:1. So option C matches that.\n\nBut looking back, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the F2, each trait is determined independently. So for the C/B locus, the phenotypes are:\n- Checkered red (C present, B present)\n- Checkered brown (C present, b present)\n- Plain red (c present, B present)\n- Plain brown (c present, b present)\n\nThe number of each phenotype in F2 is:\n- Checkered red: (number of CC + Cc + cc) for the C/B locus multiplied by (number of BB + Bb + bb) for the c/b locus. Wait, no, each gene is independent, so the phenotypes are additive.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio for two independent traits.\n\nYes, so the correct option is C, which lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means both its genes are dominant. The other bird is a plain brown, meaning one of their alleles is recessive. We need to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation after crossing them.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information:\n\n- The dominant gene C controls checkered patterns.\n- The recessive allele c makes the pattern plain.\n- The dominant gene B determines red color.\n- The recessive allele b results in brown color.\n\nSo, the parents involved are:\n1. Homozygous checkered red (CC BB)\n2. Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nWe're looking at an A. Assume we're considering a standard dihybrid cross where each parent contributes gametes based on their genotype.\n\nLet me outline the steps needed:\n\n1. Determine the possible gametes from each parent.\n2. Create a Punnett square using these gametes.\n3. Analyze the resulting F2 generation to find the phenotypic ratio.\n\nStarting with the first parent, CC BB. Since both genes are dominant (C and B), they will produce only one type of gamete: C B. So all gametes from this bird are CB.\n\nFor the second parent, cc bb. Here, both genes are recessive, so they can only produce gametes that are recessive: cb.\n\nNow, when these two parents (CB and cb) mate, the possible offspring combinations would be:\n\nCB (from the first parent) \u00d7 cb (from the second parent).\n\nSo the F1 generation would have the combination CB \u00d7 cb, but since each parent only produces one type of gamete, the F1 should be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Because each parent is producing one gamete, so the F1 would actually have Cc and Bb as their genotype. But wait, the F1 comes from a cross between a heterozygote (homozygous) and another heterozygote? No, in this case, both parents are homozygous\u2014wait, no: the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous, and the second is cc bb, also homozygous. So their cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb). That's not a typical dihybrid cross because dihybrid crosses involve parents who are heterozygous (e.g., CcBb). In this case, the parents are homozygous, so the cross will result in a specific phenotype distribution without any blending of traits.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. If both parents are homozygous, then their F1 would be the same as their parents, but that doesn't make sense because typically, dihybrid crosses are between heterozygotes. However, maybe the question is still intended to be treated as such, even though the parents are homozygous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Wait, the first parent is \"homogeneous\" checkered red. So CC BB, correct. The second parent is \"plain brown,\" which is cc bb. So yes, they are homozygous.\n\nTherefore, their cross would produce F1 as Cc Bb. But since both parents contribute only one type of gamete, the F1 would have only one genotype: Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous, their F1 would indeed be Cc Bb. So the F1 generation would consist of all Cc Bb individuals.\n\nBut the question asks about the F2 generation. Hmm, that seems contradictory because if the parents are homozygous, their offspring should all be homozygous. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but the question states that the first bird is homozygous checkered red, and the second is plain brown. So that part is clear.\n\nSo proceeding under the assumption that the parents are homozygous, CC BB and cc bb. Therefore, their F1 would be Cc Bb. And since they're both homozygous, their F2 would be the same as F1 because there's no recombination or crossing over happening\u2014in a typical dihybrid cross, crossover occurs during meiosis, leading to recombinant types. Without any information suggesting that, we can assume no crossover, so F2 is same as F1.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies F2, implying that the cross is between F1 and something else. Oh, no\u2014the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" These are the parents for the initial cross. Then, the options provided include F1, F2, etc., up to F\u221e.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 generation of the cross between these two parents, but those parents are themselves the F0 or parents for the next generation. Let me clarify.\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, typically, the parents are heterozygous (CcBb), but here the parents are homozygous. So their offspring would all be Cc Bb, and thus F1 would be all Cc Bb. Then, since the question refers to F2, it must mean that the F1s are crossed among themselves. But if the F1s are all Cc Bb, then their cross would produce F2 as well.\n\nSo let's proceed accordingly.\n\nParental Crosses:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nF1 Generation: All Cc Bb (since each parent contributes either C or c, and B or b, but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, the F1 would have Cc Bb.)\n\nThen, F1 (Cc Bb) is crossed with itself to get F2.\n\nSo now, the F2 generation will come from F1 \u00d7 F1, which is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nTo analyze the phenotypic ratio, I'll need to consider the genetic ratios first before mapping to phenotypes.\n\nEach trait is controlled by a separate gene. So for each gene, we can calculate the probabilities of the resulting phenotypes.\n\nGene C (dominant = checkered, recessive = plain):\n- Parent: C (homozygous dominant)\n- Offspring: 100% C (so checkered)\n\nGene B (dominant = red, recessive = brown):\n- Parent: B (homozygous dominant)\n- Offspring: 100% B (so red)\n\nSince both genes are dominant in the F1, the F2 offspring will inherit the same as the F1 for each gene. Thus, each offspring will be Cc (checkered) and Bb (red), making their phenotype checkered red.\n\nHowever, the question mentions a checkered pattern, which might imply that the presence of the dominant allele C affects the pattern, while the dominance of B affects color.\n\nWait, the question says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and red by B. So the combination of dominant alleles (C and B) would result in red checkered (checkered pattern plus red color), while the combination of recessive alleles (c and b) would result in plain checkered (checkered pattern without red color).\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nSo for each gene:\n\n- Gene C:\n  - Dominant (C): Checkered\n  - Recessive (c): Plain\n\n- Gene B:\n  - Dominant (B): Red\n  - Recessive (b): Brown\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain brown (cccc)\n\nWait, but since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be Cc Bb, which would always express dominant traits. So the F2 would be Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb, resulting in the following possibilities:\n\nPossible gametes from Cc Bb would be:\n\n- C B (25%)\n- C b (25%)\n- c B (25%)\n- c b (25%)\n\nSo when creating the Punnett square:\n\n```\n          | C B | C b | c B | c b |\n----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n        C   | C C (CC, checkered red)| C c (checkered brown)| c C (plain red)| c c (plain brown)|\n        B     | C B (checkered red)| C b (checkered brown)| c B (plain red)| c b (plain brown)|\n        b     | C b (checkered red)| C b (checkered brown)| c b (plain red)| c b (plain brown)|\n        b     | C b (checkered red)| C b (checkered brown)| c b (plain red)| c b (plain brown)|\n```\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Each gene is independent. So for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nGene C:\n- Parent: Cc \u2192 Segregation: 50% C, 50% c\n\nGene B:\n- Parent: Bb \u2192 Segregation: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, the combined segregation for both genes would be 25% for each combination.\n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (wait, no\u2014it\u2019s CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, CC bb?)\n\nWait, no, each parent is Cc Bb, so the F2 would have:\n\n- CC (50% from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cC (same as Cc)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (50%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bB (same as Bb)\n- bb (25%)\n\nCombining both, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (no, wait, it's CC \u00d7 Cc for gene B?), perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nActually, each gene segregates independently, so the combination of C and B would give 16 possible phenotypic outcomes. But given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 was Cc Bb, which is 100% C and B.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be Cc Bb, which is all dominant. Then, F1 (Cc Bb) \u00d7 F1 (Cc Bb) would produce F2.\n\nSo the F2 would be a dihybrid cross for C and B, each with 50% dominant and recessive.\n\nSo the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: 50% C, 50% c\n- Gene B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nCombined, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (same as above?)\nWait, no, each gene has two possibilities, so 16 possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. CC bb (duplicate)\n5. CC bb\n6. CC bb\n7. CC bb\n8. CC bb\n9. ... Wait, perhaps better to list them as:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% CC bb (again, same as above)\nNo, that's not correct. It should be:\n\nEach gene has two possibilities, so the combinations are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CC Bb\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 CC bb\n4. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc BB\n5. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc Bb\n6. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc bb\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc BB\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc Bb\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut some of these are duplicates. So the unique combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. cc BB (25%)\n5. cc Bb (25%)\n6. cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no, each gene is present twice, so the actual counts are:\n\n- For Gene C: 50% C, 50% c\n- For Gene B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the total combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. cc BB (25%)\n5. cc Bb (25%)\n6. cc bb (25%)\n\nYes, that's accurate. Now, each of these corresponds to a phenotype based on the dominance.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- CC (for C) and BB (for B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (25% + 25% + 25%) = 75%\n2. Checkered brown (25%) \n3. Plain red (25% + 25%) = 50%\n4. Plain brown (25% + 25%) = 50%\n\nWait, but let's count correctly:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\nCheckered brown: CC bb \u2192 Wait, no, CC bb is plain red, not brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds. One bird is a homozygous checkered red, which means both its genes are dominant. The other bird is a plain brown, meaning one of their alleles is recessive. We need to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation after crossing them.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information:\n\n- The dominant gene C controls checkered patterns.\n- The recessive allele c makes the pattern plain.\n- The dominant gene B determines red color.\n- The recessive allele b results in brown color.\n\nSo, the parents involved are:\n1. Homozygous checkered red (CC BB)\n2. Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nWe're looking at an A. Assume we're considering a standard dihybrid cross where each parent contributes gametes based on their genotype.\n\nLet me outline the steps needed:\n\n1. Determine the possible gametes from each parent.\n2. Create a Punnett square using these gametes.\n3. Analyze the resulting F2 generation to find the phenotypic ratio.\n\nStarting with the first parent, CC BB. Since both genes are dominant (C and B), they will produce only one type of gamete: C B. So all gametes from this bird are CB.\n\nFor the second parent, cc bb. Here, both genes are recessive, so they can only produce gametes that are recessive: cb.\n\nNow, when these two parents (CB and cb) mate, the possible offspring combinations would be:\n\nCB (from the first parent) \u00d7 cb (from the second parent).\n\nSo the F1 generation would have the combination CB \u00d7 cb, but since each parent only produces one type of gamete, the F1 should be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Because each parent is producing one gamete, so the F1 would actually have Cc and Bb as their genotype. But wait, the F1 comes from a cross between a heterozygote (homozygous) and another heterozygote? No, in this case, both parents are homozygous\u2014wait, no: the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous, and the second is cc bb, also homozygous. So their cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb). That's not a typical dihybrid cross because dihybrid crosses involve parents who are heterozygous (e.g., CcBb). In this case, the parents are homozygous, so the cross will result in a specific phenotype distribution without any blending of traits.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. If both parents are homozygous, then their F1 would be the same as their parents, but that doesn't make sense because typically, dihybrid crosses are between heterozygotes. However, maybe the question is still intended to be treated as such, even though the parents are homozygous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. Wait, the first parent is \"homogeneous\" checkered red. So CC BB, correct. The second parent is \"plain brown,\" which is cc bb. So yes, they are homozygous.\n\nTherefore, their cross would produce F1 as Cc Bb. But since both parents contribute only one type of gamete, the F1 would have only one genotype: Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous, their F1 would indeed be Cc Bb. So the F1 generation would consist of all Cc Bb individuals.\n\nBut the question asks about the F2 generation. Hmm, that seems contradictory because if the parents are homozygous, their offspring should all be homozygous. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but the question states that the first bird is homozygous checkered red, and the second is plain brown. So that part is clear.\n\nSo proceeding under the assumption that the parents are homozygous, CC BB and cc bb. Therefore, their F1 would be Cc Bb. And since they're both homozygous, their F2 would be the same as F1 because there's no recombination or crossing over happening\u2014in a typical dihybrid cross, crossover occurs during meiosis, leading to recombinant types. Without any information suggesting that, we can assume no crossover, so F2 is same as F1.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies F2, implying that the cross is between F1 and something else. Oh, no\u2014the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" These are the parents for the initial cross. Then, the options provided include F1, F2, etc., up to F\u221e.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 generation of the cross between these two parents, but those parents are themselves the F0 or parents for the next generation. Let me clarify.\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, typically, the parents are heterozygous (CcBb), but here the parents are homozygous. So their offspring would all be Cc Bb, and thus F1 would be all Cc Bb. Then, since the question refers to F2, it must mean that the F1s are crossed among themselves. But if the F1s are all Cc Bb, then their cross would produce F2 as well.\n\nSo let's proceed accordingly.\n\nParental Crosses:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits)\n\nF1 Generation: All Cc Bb (since each parent contributes either C or c, and B or b, but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, the F1 would have Cc Bb.)\n\nThen, F1 (Cc Bb) is crossed with itself to get F2.\n\nSo now, the F2 generation will come from F1 \u00d7 F1, which is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nTo analyze the phenotypic ratio, I'll need to consider the genetic ratios first before mapping to phenotypes.\n\nEach trait is controlled by a separate gene. So for each gene, we can calculate the probabilities of the resulting phenotypes.\n\nGene C (dominant = checkered, recessive = plain):\n- Parent: C (homozygous dominant)\n- Offspring: 100% C (so checkered)\n\nGene B (dominant = red, recessive = brown):\n- Parent: B (homozygous dominant)\n- Offspring: 100% B (so red)\n\nSince both genes are dominant in the F1, the F2 offspring will inherit the same as the F1 for each gene. Thus, each offspring will be Cc (checkered) and Bb (red), making their phenotype checkered red.\n\nHowever, the question mentions a checkered pattern, which might imply that the presence of the dominant allele C affects the pattern, while the dominance of B affects color.\n\nWait, the question says the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and red by B. So the combination of dominant alleles (C and B) would result in red checkered (checkered pattern plus red color), while the combination of recessive alleles (c and b) would result in plain checkered (checkered pattern without red color).\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nSo for each gene:\n\n- Gene C:\n  - Dominant (C): Checkered\n  - Recessive (c): Plain\n\n- Gene B:\n  - Dominant (B): Red\n  - Recessive (b): Brown\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain red (cc_B_)\n4. Plain brown (cccc)\n\nWait, but since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be Cc Bb, which would always express dominant traits. So the F2 would be Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb, resulting in the following possibilities:\n\nPossible gametes from Cc Bb would be:\n\n- C B (25%)\n- C b (25%)\n- c B (25%)\n- c b (25%)\n\nSo when creating the Punnett square:\n\n```\n          | C B | C b | c B | c b |\n----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n        C   | C C (CC, checkered red)| C c (checkered brown)| c C (plain red)| c c (plain brown)|\n        B     | C B (checkered red)| C b (checkered brown)| c B (plain red)| c b (plain brown)|\n        b     | C b (checkered red)| C b (checkered brown)| c b (plain red)| c b (plain brown)|\n        b     | C b (checkered red)| C b (checkered brown)| c b (plain red)| c b (plain brown)|\n```\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Each gene is independent. So for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nGene C:\n- Parent: Cc \u2192 Segregation: 50% C, 50% c\n\nGene B:\n- Parent: Bb \u2192 Segregation: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, the combined segregation for both genes would be 25% for each combination.\n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (wait, no\u2014it\u2019s CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, CC bb?)\n\nWait, no, each parent is Cc Bb, so the F2 would have:\n\n- CC (50% from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cC (same as Cc)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (50%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bB (same as Bb)\n- bb (25%)\n\nCombining both, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (no, wait, it's CC \u00d7 Cc for gene B?), perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nActually, each gene segregates independently, so the combination of C and B would give 16 possible phenotypic outcomes. But given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 was Cc Bb, which is 100% C and B.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be Cc Bb, which is all dominant. Then, F1 (Cc Bb) \u00d7 F1 (Cc Bb) would produce F2.\n\nSo the F2 would be a dihybrid cross for C and B, each with 50% dominant and recessive.\n\nSo the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: 50% C, 50% c\n- Gene B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nCombined, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (same as above?)\nWait, no, each gene has two possibilities, so 16 possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. CC bb (duplicate)\n5. CC bb\n6. CC bb\n7. CC bb\n8. CC bb\n9. ... Wait, perhaps better to list them as:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% CC bb (again, same as above)\nNo, that's not correct. It should be:\n\nEach gene has two possibilities, so the combinations are:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CC Bb\n3. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 CC bb\n4. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc BB\n5. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc Bb\n6. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc bb\n7. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc BB\n8. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc Bb\n9. cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut some of these are duplicates. So the unique combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. cc BB (25%)\n5. cc Bb (25%)\n6. cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no, each gene is present twice, so the actual counts are:\n\n- For Gene C: 50% C, 50% c\n- For Gene B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the total combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. cc BB (25%)\n5. cc Bb (25%)\n6. cc bb (25%)\n\nYes, that's accurate. Now, each of these corresponds to a phenotype based on the dominance.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- CC (for C) and BB (for B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (25% + 25% + 25%) = 75%\n2. Checkered brown (25%) \n3. Plain red (25% + 25%) = 50%\n4. Plain brown (25% + 25%) = 50%\n\nWait, but let's count correctly:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\nCheckered brown: CC bb \u2192 Wait, no, CC bb is plain red, not brown. Wait, correction:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC BB) + 25% (CC Bb) = 50%\nWait, no, each category is 25%, but checking again:\n\nWait, the six phenotypes are:\n\n1.

    "rollout": " Let me read it again.\n\nWe have two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). They're going to produce an F2 generation, and I need to find their phenotypic ratio based on the traits given.\n\nThe traits are determined by genes C and B for color, where C is dominant and c is recessive, and B is dominant for red, while b is recessive for brown. So each bird will have two alleles for each gene\u2014so four in total\u2014and these combinations determine their phenotype.\n\nFirst, I think I should construct the Punnett square for the cross between CCBB and ccbb. Since both parents are homozygous, but one has all dominant and the other all recessive, the F1 generation will be heterozygotes. But wait, no\u2014the parents here are both homozygous, so their offspring will all be CcBB because they receive one allele from each parent. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second parent is ccbb, which would mean all its gametes carry 'c' and 'b', but since it's homozygous, each gamete is 'cb'. So when CCBB (which is CC BB) combines with ccbb (which is 'cb'), the F1 would be Cc for the first gene and BB for the second. So yes, all F1s are CcBB. Then, when F1s self-pollinate, we get F2.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross,\" but actually, it's an F2 generation, so maybe it's about the F2 from the F1 cross? Hmm, perhaps I misread. The initial statement mentions aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adihybrid crosses are typically for two different traits, like AaBb x AaBb, but here it's two birds. Maybe it's about the cross between these two birds resulting in F1, then F1 selfing to get F2?\n\nWait, the problem asks for the F2 generation, so let's focus on that. Each bird is a homozygote:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nEach bird will produce gametes as follows:\n\nFor Parent 1 (CCBB):\n- Both alleles are dominant, so all gametes are CB.\n\nFor Parent 2 (ccbb):\n- Both alleles are recessive, so all gametes are cb.\n\nSo the F1 generation will be the combination of Parent 1's gametes (CB) and Parent 2's gametes (cb):\n\nF1 genotypes:\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\nWait, no. Wait, each bird contributes one allele. So each F1 bird gets one allele from each parent. So from Parent 1, it can give either C or B. From Parent 2, it gives either c or b. So the possible gametes are Cc (from Parent 1's C and Parent 2's c) and Bb (from Parent 1's B and Parent 2's b). But since both parents contribute one allele each, the F1 bird will have either Cc or Bb from each gene. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Each bird has two alleles per gene. So for the first gene (C and c), Parent 1 provides C, Parent 2 provides c, so F1 has Cc. For the second gene (B and b), Parent 1 provides B, Parent 2 provides b, so F1 has Bb. So each F1 bird is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 self-pollinates to get F2. The F2 genotypes will depend on the possible combinations of the F1's alleles.\n\nBut wait, the F1 is Cc Bb. When they self, each gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nLet's break it down for each gene:\n\nGene 1 (C and c):\nParent: Cc\nPossible gametes: C (25%) and c (75%)\nProbability of Cc (for Gene 1): 50%\nProbability of cc (homozygous recessive): 25%\n\nGene 2 (B and b):\nParent: Bb\nPossible gametes: B (50%) and b (50%)\nProbability of Bb (for Gene 2): 50%\nProbability of bb (homozygous recessive): 25%\n\nNow, combining these two genes, the F2 individuals will have a genotype distribution that is the product of the two individual distributions.\n\nSo, for Gene 1, the possibilities are:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor Gene 2, the possibilities are:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nTo find the combined probabilities, multiply the probabilities of each gene's outcome.\n\nFor example, probability of CC BB is (25% for Gene 1) * (25% for Gene 2) = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nCC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nCc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nCc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nCc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\ncc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\ncc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\ncc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes based on the given criteria:\n\n- Checkered red: C is dominant, so any presence of C makes the bird checkered. Also, c is recessive, so if it's c, it's plain. Wait, no: The first trait is C/B for color. So C is dominant for red (so any bird with at least one C allele will be red?), but the second trait is B/b for color too. So each bird has two alleles for each trait.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain\n- Dominant B \u2192 red\n- Recessive b \u2192 brown\n\nWait, but each bird has two traits: one for color (C/B) and another for color (B/b). So a bird's phenotype depends on both genes. So, for each bird, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (either C or B), it will appear as red. If it has two recessive alleles (both c and b), then it'll be plain. Similarly, for brown, it needs to have at least one b allele.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because each trait is determined independently. So for the first trait (color based on C/B), the bird will be red if it has at least one dominant allele (C or B), else plain. For the second trait (brown based on B/b), the bird will be brown if it has at least one dominant allele (B or b), else plain.\n\nWait, but wait: The problem says:\n\nRed color is controlled by dominant gene C, plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nBrown color is controlled by dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, for each bird, the color trait (red or plain) is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for that color. Similarly, brown is determined by having at least one dominant allele for brown.\n\nWait, no. No, that's not correct. Because the dominance applies to each trait separately. So, for red, the presence of C means red; otherwise, plain. For brown, presence of B means brown; otherwise, plain.\n\nWait, but the way it's worded: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the bird is red if it has at least one C allele (since C is dominant); else plain. Similarly, brown is present if at least one B allele is present; else plain.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because usually, you see multiple traits, but here it's probably a case where each bird has two traits, each determined independently. So a bird could be red and brown, red and plain, plain and brown, or plain and plain.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, some options don't include all four combinations. For example, option G shows checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests that checkered red is the maximum, and there are zero plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, a bird could be plain red if it has two recessive alleles (cc and bb), meaning both traits are plain. So perhaps the phenotypes are based on the combination of both traits.\n\nWait, let me try to outline all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nEach F2 individual has two alleles for each trait. The possible genotypes for each trait are CC, Cc, cc.\n\nFor each trait, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele.\n\nSo, for the first trait (color based on C/B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one C, it's red.\n- If it has two c's, it's plain.\n\nFor the second trait (brown based on B/b):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B, it's brown.\n- If it has two b's, it's plain.\n\nThe overall phenotype of the bird is determined by both traits. So, the bird's phenotype is red-brown if it's red and brown, red-brown if red and plain, etc.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that the bird's phenotype is determined by each trait individually, regardless of the other. So, for each trait, the bird must meet the dominant condition to express that trait.\n\nThus, a bird is considered red if it has at least one C allele, and brown if it has at least one B allele. Plain is when both are recessive (no dominant allele).\n\nWait, but that might not make sense because the problem states that each bird has two traits, each determined by separate genes. So, a bird could have a combination of red and brown, red and plain, plain and brown, or plain and plain.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests that there are 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That adds up to 16, which matches the expected 16 F2 individuals.\n\nWait, but how does that happen? Let's consider the possible F2 genotypes.\n\nFrom the Punnett square calculation, we had 25% CC BB, 50% Cc BB, 25% cc BB,\n\n25% CC Bb, 50% Cc Bb, 25% cc Bb,\n\n25% CC bb, 50% Cc bb, 25% cc bb.\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each trait.\n\nSo, let's go through each possibility:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - Color (C): C is dominant \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): B is dominant \u2192 brown.\n   - Overall: red-brown.\n\n2. Cc BB:\n   - Color (C): C present \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): B present \u2192 brown.\n   - Overall: red-brown.\n\n3. cc BB:\n   - Color (C): c present \u2192 plain.\n   - Brown (B): B present \u2192 brown.\n   - Overall: plain-brown.\n\n4. CC Bb:\n   - Color (C): C present \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): B present \u2192 brown.\n   - Overall: red-brown.\n\n5. Cc Bb:\n   - Color (C): C present \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): B present \u2192 brown.\n   - Overall: red-brown.\n\n6. cc Bb:\n   - Color (C): c present \u2192 plain.\n   - Brown (B): B present \u2192 brown.\n   - Overall: plain-brown.\n\n7. CC bb:\n   - Color (C): C present \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): b present \u2192 plain.\n   - Overall: red-plain.\n\n8. Cc bb:\n   - Color (C): C present \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): b present \u2192 plain.\n   - Overall: red-plain.\n\n9. cc bb:\n   - Color (C): c present \u2192 plain.\n   - Brown (B): b present \u2192 plain.\n   - Overall: plain-plain.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- red-brown: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 \u2192 5 cases.\n- plain-brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case.\n- red-plain: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 cases.\n- plain-plain: Case 9 \u2192 1 case.\n\nWait, but in the options provided, none match exactly. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nWait, each F2 individual comes from a self-pollination, so the F2 population is calculated correctly as above. But the options don't match perfectly. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F1 are all checkered red (Cc BB) and all plain brown (cc bb), leading to the F2 being as I calculated before. So the phenotypic breakdown would be:\n\n- red-brown: All except those who are plain-brown and plain-plain.\n- plain-brown: Only the cc Bb and cc bb.\n- red-plain: Only the CC bb and Cc bb.\n- plain-plain: Only the cc bb.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier count, red-brown is 5, plain-brown is 1, red-plain is 2, plain-plain is 1. But none of the options match this exact distribution.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nOption K: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.\n\nOption L: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nOption M: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nOption N: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nOption O: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nOption P: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nOption Q: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nOption R: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nWait, this matches option Q and R, but they're the same. So perhaps the correct answer is option Q or R, but likely option Q.\n\nWait, but let's re-examine the counts. According to the Punnett square:\n\n- red-brown: Cases 1,2,4,5,6 \u2192 5\n- plain-brown: 3 \u2192 1\n- red-plain: 7,8 \u2192 2\n- plain-plain: 9 \u2192 1\n\nBut none of the options match this. However, option H is:\n\nCheckered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nThat sums to 5+3+2+6=16, which fits. But the actual counts aren't matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation isn't just the F1 selfing but perhaps a dihybrid cross, but I thought the F2 came from F1 selfing. Or maybe the question is using a dihybrid cross without considering the genetic independence.\n\nWait, the problem says it's an F2 generation, so perhaps the cross is between F1 and F1. Which is what I did earlier.\n\nBut according to that, the phenotypic ratio would be checkered red (5), checkered brown (1), plain red (2), plain brown (1). But that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, let's redo the count:\n\nFrom the Punnett square after selfing:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,2,4,5,6 \u2192 5\n- Checkered brown: None, since all checkered red have B present, so they are red-brown, not brown.\n- Plain red: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: Case 3 \u2192 1\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Looking again:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nNope.\n\nOption Q: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the F2 generation. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nEach F1 bird is Cc BB (checkered red). When they self, each bird produces gametes with C or c for the first trait and B or b for the second trait. The proportion of each gamete is 50% C, 50% c for the first trait, and 50% B, 50% b for the second trait.\n\nWhen you cross two Cc (first trait) and two Bb (second trait), the probability for each trait is independent. So for the first trait, the probability of C is 50%, c is 50%. For the second trait, B is 50%, b is 50%.\n\nThe overall phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele in each trait. So, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one C (dominant) in the first trait. To be brown, it must have at least one B in the second trait.\n\nThus, the bird's phenotype is red if it has at least one C, brown if it has at least one B, and the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWe have two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). They're going to produce an F2 generation, and I need to find their phenotypic ratio based on the traits given.\n\nThe traits are determined by genes C and B for color, where C is dominant and c is recessive, and B is dominant for red, while b is recessive for brown. So each bird will have two alleles for each gene\u2014so four in total\u2014and these combinations determine their phenotype.\n\nFirst, I think I should construct the Punnett square for the cross between CCBB and ccbb. Since both parents are homozygous, but one has all dominant and the other all recessive, the F1 generation will be heterozygotes. But wait, no\u2014the parents here are both homozygous, so their offspring will all be CcBB because they receive one allele from each parent. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second parent is ccbb, which would mean all its gametes carry 'c' and 'b', but since it's homozygous, each gamete is 'cb'. So when CCBB (which is CC BB) combines with ccbb (which is 'cb'), the F1 would be Cc for the first gene and BB for the second. So yes, all F1s are CcBB. Then, when F1s self-pollinate, we get F2.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross,\" but actually, it's an F2 generation, so maybe it's about the F2 from the F1 cross? Hmm, perhaps I misread. The initial statement mentions aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adihybrid crosses are typically for two different traits, like AaBb x AaBb, but here it's two birds. Maybe it's about the cross between these two birds resulting in F1, then F1 selfing to get F2?\n\nWait, the problem asks for the F2 generation, so let's focus on that. Each bird is a homozygote:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nEach bird will produce gametes as follows:\n\nFor Parent 1 (CCBB):\n- Both alleles are dominant, so all gametes are CB.\n\nFor Parent 2 (ccbb):\n- Both alleles are recessive, so all gametes are cb.\n\nSo the F1 generation will be the combination of Parent 1's gametes (CB) and Parent 2's gametes (cb):\n\nF1 genotypes:\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n\nWait, no. Wait, each bird contributes one allele. So each F1 bird gets one allele from each parent. So from Parent 1, it can give either C or B. From Parent 2, it gives either c or b. So the possible gametes are Cc (from Parent 1's C and Parent 2's c) and Bb (from Parent 1's B and Parent 2's b). But since both parents contribute one allele each, the F1 bird will have either Cc or Bb from each gene. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Each bird has two alleles per gene. So for the first gene (C and c), Parent 1 provides C, Parent 2 provides c, so F1 has Cc. For the second gene (B and b), Parent 1 provides B, Parent 2 provides b, so F1 has Bb. So each F1 bird is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 self-pollinates to get F2. The F2 genotypes will depend on the possible combinations of the F1's alleles.\n\nBut wait, the F1 is Cc Bb. When they self, each gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nLet's break it down for each gene:\n\nGene 1 (C and c):\nParent: Cc\nPossible gametes: C (25%) and c (75%)\nProbability of Cc (for Gene 1): 50%\nProbability of cc (homozygous recessive): 25%\n\nGene 2 (B and b):\nParent: Bb\nPossible gametes: B (50%) and b (50%)\nProbability of Bb (for Gene 2): 50%\nProbability of bb (homozygous recessive): 25%\n\nNow, combining these two genes, the F2 individuals will have a genotype distribution that is the product of the two individual distributions.\n\nSo, for Gene 1, the possibilities are:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor Gene 2, the possibilities are:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nTo find the combined probabilities, multiply the probabilities of each gene's outcome.\n\nFor example, probability of CC BB is (25% for Gene 1) * (25% for Gene 2) = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nCC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nCc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nCc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nCc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\ncc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\ncc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\ncc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes based on the given criteria:\n\n- Checkered red: C is dominant, so any presence of C makes the bird checkered. Also, c is recessive, so if it's c, it's plain. Wait, no: The first trait is C/B for color. So C is dominant for red (so any bird with at least one C allele will be red?), but the second trait is B/b for color too. So each bird has two alleles for each trait.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain\n- Dominant B \u2192 red\n- Recessive b \u2192 brown\n\nWait, but each bird has two traits: one for color (C/B) and another for color (B/b). So a bird's phenotype depends on both genes. So, for each bird, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (either C or B), it will appear as red. If it has two recessive alleles (both c and b), then it'll be plain. Similarly, for brown, it needs to have at least one b allele.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because each trait is determined independently. So for the first trait (color based on C/B), the bird will be red if it has at least one dominant allele (C or B), else plain. For the second trait (brown based on B/b), the bird will be brown if it has at least one dominant allele (B or b), else plain.\n\nWait, but wait: The problem says:\n\nRed color is controlled by dominant gene C, plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nBrown color is controlled by dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, for each bird, the color trait (red or plain) is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for that color. Similarly, brown is determined by having at least one dominant allele for brown.\n\nWait, no. No, that's not correct. Because the dominance applies to each trait separately.

So a bird could be red and brown, red and plain, plain and brown, or plain and plain.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, some options don't include all four combinations. For example, option G shows checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests that checkered red is the maximum, and there are zero plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, a bird could be plain red if it has two recessive alleles (cc and bb), meaning both traits are plain. So perhaps the phenotypes are based on the combination of both traits.\n\nWait, let me try to outline all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nEach F2 individual has two alleles for each trait. The possible genotypes for each trait are CC, Cc, cc.\n\nFor each trait, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele.\n\nSo, for the first trait (color based on C/B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one C, it's red.\n- If it has two c's, it's plain.\n\nFor the second trait (brown based on B/b):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B, it's brown.\n- If it has two b's, it's plain.\n\nThe overall phenotype of the bird is determined by both traits.

So, a bird could have a combination of red and brown, red and plain, plain and brown, or plain and plain.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests that there are 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That adds up to 16, which matches the expected 16 F2 individuals.\n\nWait, but how does that happen? Let's consider the possible F2 genotypes.\n\nFrom the Punnett square calculation, we had 25% CC BB, 50% Cc BB, 25% cc BB,\n\n25% CC Bb, 50% Cc Bb, 25% cc Bb,\n\n25% CC bb, 50% Cc bb, 25% cc bb.\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each trait.\n\nSo, let's go through each possibility:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - Color (C): C is dominant \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): B is dominant \u2192 brown.\n   - Overall: red-brown.\n\n2.

CC bb:\n   - Color (C): C present \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): b present \u2192 plain.\n   - Overall: red-plain.\n\n8. Cc bb:\n   - Color (C): C present \u2192 red.\n   - Brown (B): b present \u2192 plain.\n   - Overall: red-plain.\n\n9. cc bb:\n   - Color (C): c present \u2192 plain.\n   - Brown (B): b present \u2192 plain.\n   - Overall: plain-plain.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- red-brown: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 \u2192 5 cases.\n- plain-brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case.\n- red-plain: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 cases.\n- plain-plain: Case 9 \u2192 1 case.\n\nWait, but in the options provided, none match exactly. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting.

But none of the options match this exact distribution.\n\nLooking back at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nOption K: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.\n\nOption L: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nOption M: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nOption N: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nOption O: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nOption P: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nOption Q: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nOption R: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nWait, this matches option Q and R, but they're the same. So perhaps the correct answer is option Q or R, but likely option Q.\n\nWait, but let's re-examine the counts. According to the Punnett square:\n\n- red-brown: Cases 1,2,4,5,6 \u2192 5\n- plain-brown: 3 \u2192 1\n- red-plain: 7,8 \u2192 2\n- plain-plain: 9 \u2192 1\n\nBut none of the options match this. However, option H is:\n\nCheckered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nThat sums to 5+3+2+6=16, which fits. But the actual counts aren't matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation isn't just the F1 selfing but perhaps a dihybrid cross, but I thought the F2 came from F1 selfing. Or maybe the question is using a dihybrid cross without considering the genetic independence.\n\nWait, the problem says it's an F2 generation, so perhaps the cross is between F1 and F1. Which is what I did earlier.\n\nBut according to that, the phenotypic ratio would be checkered red (5), checkered brown (1), plain red (2), plain brown (1). But that's not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, let's redo the count:\n\nFrom the Punnett square after selfing:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,2,4,5,6 \u2192 5\n- Checkered brown: None, since all checkered red have B present, so they are red-brown, not brown.\n- Plain red: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: Case 3 \u2192 1\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Looking again:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nNope.\n\nOption Q: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the F2 generation. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nEach F1 bird is Cc BB (checkered red). When they self, each bird produces gametes with C or c for the first trait and B or b for the second trait. The proportion of each gamete is 50% C, 50% c for the first trait, and 50% B, 50% b for the second trait.\n\nWhen you cross two Cc (first trait) and two Bb (second trait), the probability for each trait is independent. So for the first trait, the probability of C is 50%, c is 50%. For the second trait, B is 50%, b is 50%.\n\nThe overall phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele in each trait. So, for a bird to be red, it must have at least one C (dominant) in the first trait. To be brown, it must have at least one B in the second trait.\n\nThus, the bird's phenotype is red if it has at least one C, brown if it has at least one B, and the",

    "rollout": " Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the traits involved. There are two genes mentioned: one controlling pigment color (B for brown, b for brown as well? Wait, no\u2014wait, the problem says red is B and brown is b. So maybe B is dominant for red or something else. Wait, actually, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by the recessive allele b. So B is dominant for red, meaning that if you have at least one B allele, you'll have red color. If both alleles are b, then you'll have brown. So B is for red, and b is for brown. Got it.\n\nNext, there are two pigmentation genes: one for color (B or b), and another for pigment presence (C or c). Wait, the problem states: Checkered pattern is controlled by gene C. Plain color is determined by c. So C is for checkered pattern, and c is for plain color. So if an animal has at least one C allele, it will be checkered. Otherwise, it will be plain.\n\nThen, for pigment color: B is dominant for red, and b is for brown. So if the animal has at least one B allele, regardless of the other gene, it will be red. If they have two b alleles, it will be brown.\n\nSo, the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. That means their genotype would be CCBB for the first bird (since it's homozygous and red) and ccbb for the second bird (since it's homozygous and brown).\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014the first bird is described as \"homozygous checkered red.\" So if checkered is C, then the first bird must be CC. And since red is B, which is dominant, the first bird is CC BB because it's homozygous. Similarly, the second bird is plain brown, so their genotype is cc bb, because brown is b, and it's homozygous.\n\nNow, we're supposed to do an A Punnett square for an adihybridcross between these two birds. But wait, the user's initial question seems to describe a dihybrid cross, but perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of possible answers, each labeled from A to J, each giving different phenotypic ratios. They want me to pick the correct answer based on my analysis.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\n   - Parent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\n2. Create the Punnett square by combining the gametes from each parent.\n\nBut wait, in standard dihybrid crosses, you usually consider two separate genes. However, here, the parents' genotypes already include both genes. So the cross would involve the combination of the two genes.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each bird has two loci, each with two alleles. The first bird is CC BB, so for locus 1 (gene C), it's C C, and for locus 2 (gene B), it's B B. The second bird is cc bb, so locus 1 is c c, locus 2 is b b.\n\nSo when crossing these two, the gametes from each parent can combine to form the F1 generation. Then, the F1s would self-pollinate to get F2.\n\nAlternatively, since the parents are already crossed, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation after selfing F1 individuals. But let me confirm.\n\nWait, the question says \"adahybridcross\" involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adahybrid crosses typically involve three loci, but here, perhaps it's a typo, and they meant dihybrid cross. Or maybe they're considering two separate dihybrids.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the dihybrid cross where each bird contributes gametes for both genes, but given that both parents are homozygous for one gene, the gamete formation might be simpler.\n\nWait, but let's proceed methodically.\n\nEach parent has two loci:\n\nParent 1:\n- Locus 1: C C (homozygous)\n- Locus 2: B B (homozygous)\n\nParent 2:\n- Locus 1: c c (homozygous)\n- Locus 2: b b (homozygous)\n\nSo when these two parents mate, what are the possible gametes?\n\nFor each gene, the gamete will carry either the allele from the mother or the father.\n\nLocus 1 (Gene C):\n- Parent 1 provides C (from CC)\n- Parent 2 provides c (from cc)\nSo gametes are C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2)\n\nLocus 2 (Gene B):\n- Parent 1 provides B (from BB)\n- Parent 2 provides b (from bb)\nGametes are B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2)\n\nThus, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of gametes from each parent:\n\nPossible gametes from Parent 1:\n- C (for Locus 1)\n- B (for Locus 2)\n\nPossible gametes from Parent 2:\n- c (for Locus 1)\n- b (for Locus 2)\n\nSo F1 genotypes will be:\n\nFor each gamete from Parent 1 and Parent 2 combined:\n\nC + c = Cc\nC + b = Cb\nB + c = Bc\nB + b = Bb\n\nWait, but since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So the F1 should be all possible combinations:\n\nFrom Parent 1: C and B\nFrom Parent 2: c and b\n\nSo F1 genotypes are:\n\nCc (C and c)\nCb (C and b)\nBc (B and c)\nBb (B and b)\n\nAnd also any combinations like CcBb, etc., but since each parent contributes one allele, the F1 should have all combinations of C/c and B/b.\n\nWait, but actually, the F1 should be all possible combinations where each locus is independent. Since Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, the F1 will be:\n\nFor Locus 1:\n- C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc\n\nFor Locus 2:\n- B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Bb\n\nWait, but each parent contributes one allele per locus. So the F1 for Locus 1 will be C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2), resulting in Cc. Similarly, Locus 2 will be Bb.\n\nTherefore, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each parent contributes one allele, so F1 should have Cc and Bb, making the genotype CcBb.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb, then when they cross, the gametes are Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2). Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nWait, but that's only one possibility. Actually, each parent contributes one allele, so for each locus, the F1 would be a combination of the alleles from each parent. So for Locus 1, C (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) \u2192 Cc. For Locus 2, B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) \u2192 Bb. So F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nBut wait, when you cross two CcBb individuals, you get a dihybrid cross. So the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but let me confirm.\n\nThe cross is between CcBb and CcBb.\n\nEach locus is independently assorting. So for Locus 1 (C/c):\n\nProbability of C = 1/2\nProbability of c = 1/2\n\nSimilarly for Locus 2 (B/b):\nProbability of B = 1/2\nProbability of b = 1/2\n\nSince the loci are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nSo the F2 genotypic ratios would be:\n\nFor Locus 1: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor Locus 2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombined, the four possible genotypic combinations would be:\n\nCC BB (both loci), 25%\nCC Bb, 25%, \nCC bb,\nCC BB,\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately, the total genotypic ratio would be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each locus.\n\nSo for Locus 1: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor Locus 2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining them, the four possible genotypic combinations would have probabilities:\n\n(25% * 25%) = 6.25% for CC BB\n(25% * 50%) = 12.5% for CC Bb\n(25% * 25%) = 6.25% for CC bb\n(25% * 50%) = 12.5% for Cc BB\n...and so on for the rest.\n\nBut instead of calculating all four possibilities, perhaps it's easier to note that the dihybrid cross follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the expected phenotypic ratio would be 9 parts for each phenotype plus some others depending on dominance.\n\nWait, but let's look at the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n\n- For Pigment Color (B): \n  - Dominant (at least one B) \u2192 red\n  - Recessive (two b) \u2192 brown\n- For Pattern (C):\n  - Dominant (at least one C) \u2192 checkered\n  - Recessive (two c) \u2192 plain\n\nSo each individual has two phenotypes based on each gene.\n\nTo find the overall phenotypic ratio, we need to determine how many individuals fall into each category: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nGiven the dihybrid cross, the genotypic ratios are as follows:\n\nFor Locus 1 (C/c):\n- CC : Cc : cc = 25% : 50% : 25%\n\nFor Locus 2 (B/b):\n- BB : Bb : bb = 25% : 50% : 25%\n\nSo the combined genotypic ratio for both loci is:\n\nEach combination of the two loci occurs with probability (25% * 25%) = 6.25% for CC BB, and similarly for the other combinations.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether the individual has the dominant allele for pigment and/or the dominant allele for pattern.\n\nSo let's break down each combination:\n\n1. **CC BB**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. **CC Bb**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n3. **CC bb**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n4. **Cc BB**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n5. **Cc Bb**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n6. **Cc bb**\n   - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\n7. **Cc BB**\n   - Same as above: Checkered red\n\n8. **Cc Bb**\n   - Same as above: Checkered red\n\n9. **Cc bb**\n   - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\n10. **cc BB**\n    - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n    - Pattern: C (recessive) \u2192 plain\n    - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n11. **cc Bb**\n    - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n    - Pattern: C (recessive) \u2192 plain\n    - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n12. **cc bb**\n    - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n    - Pattern: C (recessive) \u2192 plain\n    - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the dihybrid cross leads to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but let's count how many fall into each category.\n\nLooking at the phenotypes:\n\nCheckered red: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6 cases\nPlain red: Cases 7-9 \u2192 3 cases\nCheckered brown: Cases 10-12 \u2192 3 cases\nPlain brown: Cases 10-12 \u2192 3 cases\n\nWait, that adds up to 6+3+3+3=15, but there are 16 possible combinations. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in reality, each individual falls into exactly one phenotype category.\n\nWait, no\u2014in fact, each of the 16 combinations corresponds to exactly one phenotype.\n\nWait, but according to our breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6\n- Plain red: Cases 7-9 \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Cases 10-12 \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: Cases 10-12 \u2192 3\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15, which doesn't add up to 16. Hmm, I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one case. Let me recount:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\nCase 10: ... Wait, did I miss something?\n\nWait, no\u2014it's 16 cases, not 9. Wait, perhaps I overcomplicated it. Let's use a better approach.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the number of offspring in each phenotypic class is calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber = (probability of phenotype) \u00d7 100%\n\nWhere the probability is derived from the dihybrid ratios.\n\nFor example, the probability of being Checkered red is the sum of the probabilities where at least one C and at least one B.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nProbability(C \u2265 1 and B \u2265 1) = 1 - Probability(C </think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So maybe B is dominant for red or something else. Wait, actually, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nRed color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by the recessive allele b. So B is dominant for red, meaning that if you have at least one B allele, you'll have red color. If both alleles are b, then you'll have brown. So B is for red, and b is for brown. Got it.\n\nNext, there are two pigmentation genes: one for color (B or b), and another for pigment presence (C or c). Wait, the problem states: Checkered pattern is controlled by gene C. Plain color is determined by c. So C is for checkered pattern, and c is for plain color. So if an animal has at least one C allele, it will be checkered.

So for Locus 1 (C/c):\n\nProbability of C = 1/2\nProbability of c = 1/2\n\nSimilarly for Locus 2 (B/b):\nProbability of B = 1/2\nProbability of b = 1/2\n\nSince the loci are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nSo the F2 genotypic ratios would be:\n\nFor Locus 1: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor Locus 2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombined, the four possible genotypic combinations would be:\n\nCC BB (both loci), 25%\nCC Bb, 25%, \nCC bb,\nCC BB,\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately, the total genotypic ratio would be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each locus.\n\nSo for Locus 1: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor Locus 2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining them, the four possible genotypic combinations would have probabilities:\n\n(25% * 25%) = 6.25% for CC BB\n(25% * 50%) = 12.5% for CC Bb\n(25% * 25%) = 6.25% for CC bb\n(25% * 50%) = 12.5% for Cc BB\n...and so on for the rest.\n\nBut instead of calculating all four possibilities, perhaps it's easier to note that the dihybrid cross follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the expected phenotypic ratio would be 9 parts for each phenotype plus some others depending on dominance.\n\nWait, but let's look at the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes:\n\n- For Pigment Color (B): \n  - Dominant (at least one B) \u2192 red\n  - Recessive (two b) \u2192 brown\n- For Pattern (C):\n  - Dominant (at least one C) \u2192 checkered\n  - Recessive (two c) \u2192 plain\n\nSo each individual has two phenotypes based on each gene.\n\nTo find the overall phenotypic ratio, we need to determine how many individuals fall into each category: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nGiven the dihybrid cross, the genotypic ratios are as follows:\n\nFor Locus 1 (C/c):\n- CC : Cc : cc = 25% : 50% : 25%\n\nFor Locus 2 (B/b):\n- BB : Bb : bb = 25% : 50% : 25%\n\nSo the combined genotypic ratio for both loci is:\n\nEach combination of the two loci occurs with probability (25% * 25%) = 6.25% for CC BB, and similarly for the other combinations.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether the individual has the dominant allele for pigment and/or the dominant allele for pattern.\n\nSo let's break down each combination:\n\n1. **CC BB**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. **CC Bb**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n3. **CC bb**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n4. **Cc BB**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n5. **Cc Bb**\n   - Pigment: B (dominant) \u2192 red\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n6. **Cc bb**\n   - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\n7. **Cc BB**\n   - Same as above: Checkered red\n\n8. **Cc Bb**\n   - Same as above: Checkered red\n\n9. **Cc bb**\n   - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n   - Pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\n10. **cc BB**\n    - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n    - Pattern: C (recessive) \u2192 plain\n    - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n11. **cc Bb**\n    - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n    - Pattern: C (recessive) \u2192 plain\n    - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\n12. **cc bb**\n    - Pigment: B (recessive) \u2192 brown\n    - Pattern: C (recessive) \u2192 plain\n    - Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the dihybrid cross leads to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but let's count how many fall into each category.\n\nLooking at the phenotypes:\n\nCheckered red: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6 cases\nPlain red: Cases 7-9 \u2192 3 cases\nCheckered brown: Cases 10-12 \u2192 3 cases\nPlain brown: Cases 10-12 \u2192 3 cases\n\nWait, that adds up to 6+3+3+3=15, but there are 16 possible combinations. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in reality, each individual falls into exactly one phenotype category.\n\nWait, no\u2014in fact, each of the 16 combinations corresponds to exactly one phenotype.\n\nWait, but according to our breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6\n- Plain red: Cases 7-9 \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Cases 10-12 \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: Cases 10-12 \u2192 3\n\nTotal: 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15, which doesn't add up to 16. Hmm, I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one case. Let me recount:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\nCase 10: ... Wait, did I miss something?\n\nWait, no\u2014it's 16 cases, not 9. Wait, perhaps I overcomplicated it. Let's use a better approach.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the number of offspring in each phenotypic class is calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber = (probability of phenotype) \u00d7 100%\n\nWhere the probability is derived from the dihybrid ratios.\n\nFor example, the probability of being Checkered red is the sum of the probabilities where at least one C and at least one B.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nProbability(C \u2265 1 and B \u2265 1) = 1 - Probability(C </think>\nThe correct answer is A",

We need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between them. Then, based on that, determine the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's understand the traits involved:\n\n- Gene C controls checkered pattern:\n  - Dominant allele C \u2192 Checkered pattern (checkered)\n  - Recessive allele c \u2192 Plain color (plain)\n\n- Gene B controls red color:\n  - Dominant allele B \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive allele b \u2192 Brown\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. The combination determines their phenotype.\n\nThe parent birds are:\n\n1. Homozygous checkered red bird: This means both alleles at the checkered locus (let's call it C) are C, so genotype CC. At the red color locus (B), since they're red, both alleles must be B, so genotype BB. So overall genotype is CcBB because each locus is independent.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, when we talk about checkered patterns, it refers to the C locus. The other locus, which is the red color (B locus), is determined separately. So the bird is CcBB? Because each gene is determined independently.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the first bird is homozygous checkered red. So, that would mean both alleles at the checkered locus (C) are C, and both alleles at the red color locus (B) are B. So genotype is CcBB?\n\nWait, but in bird terms, sometimes the notation might vary. Maybe it's better to think of it as two separate loci. So, the first bird is Cc at the checkered locus and BB at the red color locus. So its genotype is CcBB.\n\nThe second parent bird is plain brown. That means, at the checkered locus (C), it's plain, so both alleles are c. At the red color locus (B), it's brown, so both alleles are b. So its genotype is ccbb.\n\nNow, we're crossing these two parents: CcBB (parent 1) \u00d7 ccbb (parent 2).\n\nSince the genes are independent, we can treat each locus separately. So, let's handle each locus individually before combining.\n\nStarting with the checkered pattern (C locus):\n\nParent 1: Cc (so possible gametes: C and c)\nParent 2: cc (so all gametes will be c)\n\nCrossing Cc \u00d7 cc:\n\nPossible offspring genotypes for C locus:\n- C (from C from Parent 1) + c (from Parent 2): Cc\n- c (from Parent 2) + c (from Parent 2): cc\n\nSo the F1 generation will have:\n\n- 50% Cc (checkered)\n- 50% cc (plain)\n\nNext, the red color locus (B locus):\n\nParent 1: BB (both alleles are B)\nParent 2: bb (both alleles are b)\n\nCrossing BB \u00d7 bb:\n\nEach parent can only contribute one allele for B. Since Parent 1 is BB, it will contribute B. Parent 2 is bb, so it will contribute b.\n\nThus, all F1 offspring will be Bb (since each parent contributes one allele). Therefore, all F1 will have the same genotype at the red locus: Bb.\n\nWait, but hold on. If both parents are BB and bb respectively, then the only possible offspring is Bb. So, all F1 will be Bb regardless of the previous locus.\n\nTherefore, in the F1 generation:\n\n- Genotype at C locus: 50% Cc (checkered) and 50% cc (plain)\n- Genotype at B locus: All Bb (red)\n\nSo the F1 phenotypes will be:\n\n- Checkered red (CcBb) because Cc at C and Bb at B.\n- Plain brown (ccbb) because cc at C and bb at B.\n\nSo, in the F1, half are checkered red, half are plain brown.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. To get F2, we'll need to consider the selfing or another cross. But wait, the question says \"adihybrid cross,\" which usually refers to dihybrid crosses, meaning considering two different genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. It says \"for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, maybe it's not F1\u00d7F1 but rather the F2 generation after some cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygotes. But in this case, the parents are homozygous for one trait and heterozygous for another.\n\nWait, the initial cross was CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but that leads us to F1. However, the question asks for F2. So perhaps the F1 should be crossed again to get F2.\n\nBut in the given options, the answer choices are for F2. Looking back at the user's question, he provided a lot of steps leading to a Punnett square, and then options A to H. He wants the correct phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, in the process above, the F1 is 50% checkered red and 50% plain brown. Then, if we consider the F1 selfing, we'd get F2.\n\nBut in the initial setup, the question mentions a cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Perhaps the actual cross is between a CcBB and ccbb.\n\nSo, the parents are CcBB (homozygous at B?) No, wait: CcBB is a heterozygote for the C locus (C and c) and a homozygote for the B locus (B and B). Similarly, ccbb is a homozygote for C (c and c) and a homozygote for B (b and b).\n\nWhen you cross CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, what do you get?\n\nFor the C locus: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 50% Cc, 50% cc.\n\nFor the B locus: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Bb.\n\nSo F1 is 50% CcBb (checkered red) and 50% ccbb (plain brown).\n\nThen, to find F2, we would typically cross F1 with F1. But looking at the answer options, they don't seem to match F2. Instead, the options are for F1 and F2. Wait, the question seems to ask for the F2 phenotypic ratio, so perhaps the F2 comes from the F1 being crossed again.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the F1 generation is CcBb (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown).\n\nTo find F2, we need to consider the F1 individuals as parents.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb and ccbb.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the F1 is CcBb (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So each F1 is an independent\u4e2a\u4f53, but since F1 are produced from F0 \u00d7 F0, their own F1 may be mixed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the F1 as having two types: CcBb (50%) and ccbb (50%). So when these are crossed, the F2 will consist of four combinations.\n\nLet me calculate the F2.\n\nParent 1: CcBb\nParent 2: ccbb\n\nWe need to compute the F2 by selfing or between the two parents.\n\nAssuming F1 \u00d7 F1, which gives F2.\n\nSo, for each locus:\n\nC locus: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nB locus: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\nAt C locus: CC, Cc, cc\nAt B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 combinations.\n\nNow, calculating phenotypes:\n\nCC at C \u2192 checkered\ncc at C \u2192 plain\nBB at B \u2192 red\nbb at B \u2192 brown\n\nSo, each F2 individual will be a combination of these.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we need to count how many individuals fall into each phenotype category.\n\nLet me list all possibilities:\n\n1. CC (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nCounting each:\n\nCheckered Red: Cases 1 and 4 \u2192 2 individuals\nCheckered Brown: Cases 2,3,5,6 \u2192 4 individuals\nPlain Red: Case 7 \u2192 1 individual\nPlain Brown: Cases 8,9 \u2192 2 individuals\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2 : 4 : 1 : 2, which simplifies to 2:4:1:2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 6/16=3/8\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 8+4=12, but option C is 12:2:2:0 etc. Not matching.\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Which would sum to 16, 9+3+3+1=16. Ratio 9:3:3:1, which matches our counts except for scaling down by 1/ (sum 16, each divided by 16):\nOur ratio is 2:4:1:2, which is equivalent to 1:2:0.5:1, but scaled up by multiplying each by 8: 8:16:4:8, but wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the simplified form is 2:4:1:2, which sums to 9. So none of the options exactly match my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nAt C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAt B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, for each combination:\n\n1. CC (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So:\n\nCheckered Red: Cases 1 and 4 \u2192 2\nCheckered Brown: Cases 2,3,5,6 \u2192 4\nPlain Red: Case7 \u21921\nPlain Brown: Cases8,9 \u21922\n\nTotal: 2+4+1+2=9 individuals.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2:4:1:2, which corresponds to 2 parts Checkered Red, 4 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 2 Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match.\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3. Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1. That's the classic 9:3:3:1 ratio, but here, the numbers are 2:4:1:2, which is a different proportion. So none of the options seem to match.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using probability:\n\nProbability of each genotype:\n\nFor C locus:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc:25%\n\nFor B locus:\n\n- BB:25%\n- Bb:50%\n- bb:25%\n\nNow, combining:\n\nEach F2 individual is a combination of C and B genotypes.\n\nThe number of Checkered Red individuals is CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 (25% \u00d725%) = 6.25% of the population.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered Brown is CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% \u00d750% =12.5%.\n\nPlain Red is cc \u00d7 BB \u219225% \u00d725% =6.25%.\n\nPlain Brown is cc \u00d7 Bb \u219225% \u00d750% =12.5%.\n\nSo the proportions are approximately 6.25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 12.5%. Adding up to 37.5% each for Checkered and Plain, and 25% each for Brown.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this exact distribution. The closest option is D, which has 1:3:9:3, but that's a different pattern.\n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided suggest that the correct ratio is among A to H, with each having specific counts.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation is from the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nIn F1, we have 50% CcBb and 50% ccbb.\n\nSo, F2 would be the result of F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nCalculating F2:\n\nEach parent is CcBb and ccbb.\n\nF1 \u00d7 F1 cross:\n\nFor C locus:\n\nCcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 Cc (from each parent) \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nWait, no. Each parent is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for C and a heterozygote for B.\n\nSo, for C locus: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nFor B locus: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSo, F2 genotypes:\n\n25% CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n25% CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n25% CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Ccbb (Checkered Brown)\n25% Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBB (Checkered Red)\n25% Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n25% Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Ccbb (Checkered Brown)\n25% cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 ccBB (Plain Red)\n25% cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 ccBb (Plain Brown)\n25% cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccbb (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, that's more accurate. Now, categorizing:\n\nCheckered Red: CCBB, CcBB, CcBb, CcBb \u2192 4 cases\nCheckered Brown: CcBB, CcBb, CcBb \u2192 3 cases\nPlain Red: ccBB \u2192 1 case\nPlain Brown: ccBb, ccBb \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo, total:\n\nCheckered Red: 4/9 (approx 44.44%)\nCheckered Brown: 3/9 (33.33%)\nPlain Red: 1/9 (approx 11.11%)\nPlain Brown: 2/9 (approx 22.22%)\n\nBut none of the options match this. The closest is option D: 1:3:9:3, which is the 9:3:3:1 ratio for a dihybrid cross without dominance.\n\nHowever, in this case, since both B and C are codominant (as Bb and Cc are expressed), the phenotypic ratios change.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, only the presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype, not the dominance itself. So, even though B and C are codominant, the phenotypes remain as per the dominance hierarchy: B > b, C > c.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio based on F2 would be:\n\nCheckered Red: 4 cases\nCheckered Brown: 3 cases\nPlain Red: 1 case\nPlain Brown: 2 cases\n\nWhich totals 10. But wait, 4+3+1+2=10, which is less than 16. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, no. In F2, the total number of individuals is 16 (since each locus has 4 possibilities, 2x2=4, multiplied together: 4x4=16).\n\nSo, 4 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 2 Plain Brown. Total: 10. That doesn't make sense because 16 individuals shouldn't add up to 10. I must have overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the cases.\n\nLet me list all 16 possibilities:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, now adding them up:\n\nCheckered Red: 1,4 \u2192 2\nCheckered Brown: 2,3,5,6 \u2192 4\nPlain Red:7 \u21921",

We need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between them. Then, based on that, determine the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's understand the traits involved:\n\n- Gene C controls checkered pattern:\n  - Dominant allele C \u2192 Checkered pattern (checkered)\n  - Recessive allele c \u2192 Plain color (plain)\n\n- Gene B controls red color:\n  - Dominant allele B \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive allele b \u2192 Brown\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. The combination determines their phenotype.\n\nThe parent birds are:\n\n1. Homozygous checkered red bird: This means both alleles at the checkered locus (let's call it C) are C, so genotype CC. At the red color locus (B), since they're red, both alleles must be B, so genotype BB. So overall genotype is CcBB because each locus is independent.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, when we talk about checkered patterns, it refers to the C locus. The other locus, which is the red color (B locus), is determined separately. So the bird is CcBB? Because each gene is determined independently.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the first bird is homozygous checkered red. So, that would mean both alleles at the checkered locus (C) are C, and both alleles at the red color locus (B) are B. So genotype is CcBB?\n\nWait, but in bird terms, sometimes the notation might vary. Maybe it's better to think of it as two separate loci. So, the first bird is Cc at the checkered locus and BB at the red color locus. So its genotype is CcBB.\n\nThe second parent bird is plain brown. That means, at the checkered locus (C), it's plain, so both alleles are c. At the red color locus (B), it's brown, so both alleles are b. So its genotype is ccbb.\n\nNow, we're crossing these two parents: CcBB (parent 1) \u00d7 ccbb (parent 2).\n\nSince the genes are independent, we can treat each locus separately. So, let's handle each locus individually before combining.\n\nStarting with the checkered pattern (C locus):\n\nParent 1: Cc (so possible gametes: C and c)\nParent 2: cc (so all gametes will be c)\n\nCrossing Cc \u00d7 cc:\n\nPossible offspring genotypes for C locus:\n- C (from C from Parent 1) + c (from Parent 2): Cc\n- c (from Parent 2) + c (from Parent 2): cc\n\nSo the F1 generation will have:\n\n- 50% Cc (checkered)\n- 50% cc (plain)\n\nNext, the red color locus (B locus):\n\nParent 1: BB (both alleles are B)\nParent 2: bb (both alleles are b)\n\nCrossing BB \u00d7 bb:\n\nEach parent can only contribute one allele for B. Since Parent 1 is BB, it will contribute B. Parent 2 is bb, so it will contribute b.\n\nThus, all F1 offspring will be Bb (since each parent contributes one allele). Therefore, all F1 will have the same genotype at the red locus: Bb.\n\nWait, but hold on. If both parents are BB and bb respectively, then the only possible offspring is Bb. So, all F1 will be Bb regardless of the previous locus.\n\nTherefore, in the F1 generation:\n\n- Genotype at C locus: 50% Cc (checkered) and 50% cc (plain)\n- Genotype at B locus: All Bb (red)\n\nSo the F1 phenotypes will be:\n\n- Checkered red (CcBb) because Cc at C and Bb at B.\n- Plain brown (ccbb) because cc at C and bb at B.\n\nSo, in the F1, half are checkered red, half are plain brown.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. To get F2, we'll need to consider the selfing or another cross. But wait, the question says \"adihybrid cross,\" which usually refers to dihybrid crosses, meaning considering two different genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. It says \"for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, maybe it's not F1\u00d7F1 but rather the F2 generation after some cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygotes. But in this case, the parents are homozygous for one trait and heterozygous for another.\n\nWait, the initial cross was CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but that leads us to F1. However, the question asks for F2. So perhaps the F1 should be crossed again to get F2.\n\nBut in the given options, the answer choices are for F2. Looking back at the user's question, he provided a lot of steps leading to a Punnett square, and then options A to H. He wants the correct phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, in the process above, the F1 is 50% checkered red and 50% plain brown. Then, if we consider the F1 selfing, we'd get F2.\n\nBut in the initial setup, the question mentions a cross between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Perhaps the actual cross is between a CcBB and ccbb.\n\nSo, the parents are CcBB (homozygous at B?) No, wait: CcBB is a heterozygote for the C locus (C and c) and a homozygote for the B locus (B and B). Similarly, ccbb is a homozygote for C (c and c) and a homozygote for B (b and b).\n\nWhen you cross CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, what do you get?\n\nFor the C locus: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 50% Cc, 50% cc.\n\nFor the B locus: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Bb.\n\nSo F1 is 50% CcBb (checkered red) and 50% ccbb (plain brown).\n\nThen, to find F2, we would typically cross F1 with F1. But looking at the answer options, they don't seem to match F2. Instead, the options are for F1 and F2. Wait, the question seems to ask for the F2 phenotypic ratio, so perhaps the F2 comes from the F1 being crossed again.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the F1 generation is CcBb (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown).\n\nTo find F2, we need to consider the F1 individuals as parents.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb and ccbb.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the F1 is CcBb (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So each F1 is an independent\u4e2a\u4f53, but since F1 are produced from F0 \u00d7 F0, their own F1 may be mixed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the F1 as having two types: CcBb (50%) and ccbb (50%). So when these are crossed, the F2 will consist of four combinations.\n\nLet me calculate the F2.\n\nParent 1: CcBb\nParent 2: ccbb\n\nWe need to compute the F2 by selfing or between the two parents.\n\nAssuming F1 \u00d7 F1, which gives F2.\n\nSo, for each locus:\n\nC locus: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nB locus: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\nAt C locus: CC, Cc, cc\nAt B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 combinations.\n\nNow, calculating phenotypes:\n\nCC at C \u2192 checkered\ncc at C \u2192 plain\nBB at B \u2192 red\nbb at B \u2192 brown\n\nSo, each F2 individual will be a combination of these.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we need to count how many individuals fall into each phenotype category.\n\nLet me list all possibilities:\n\n1. CC (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nCounting each:\n\nCheckered Red: Cases 1 and 4 \u2192 2 individuals\nCheckered Brown: Cases 2,3,5,6 \u2192 4 individuals\nPlain Red: Case 7 \u2192 1 individual\nPlain Brown: Cases 8,9 \u2192 2 individuals\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2 : 4 : 1 : 2, which simplifies to 2:4:1:2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 6/16=3/8\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 8+4=12, but option C is 12:2:2:0 etc. Not matching.\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Which would sum to 16, 9+3+3+1=16. Ratio 9:3:3:1, which matches our counts except for scaling down by 1/ (sum 16, each divided by 16):\nOur ratio is 2:4:1:2, which is equivalent to 1:2:0.5:1, but scaled up by multiplying each by 8: 8:16:4:8, but wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the simplified form is 2:4:1:2, which sums to 9. So none of the options exactly match my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nAt C locus:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nAt B locus:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, for each combination:\n\n1. CC (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc (C) and BB (B) \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc (C) and Bb (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc (C) and bb (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So:\n\nCheckered Red: Cases 1 and 4 \u2192 2\nCheckered Brown: Cases 2,3,5,6 \u2192 4\nPlain Red: Case7 \u21921\nPlain Brown: Cases8,9 \u21922\n\nTotal: 2+4+1+2=9 individuals.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2:4:1:2, which corresponds to 2 parts Checkered Red, 4 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 2 Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match.\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3. Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1. That's the classic 9:3:3:1 ratio, but here, the numbers are 2:4:1:2, which is a different proportion. So none of the options seem to match.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using probability:\n\nProbability of each genotype:\n\nFor C locus:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc:25%\n\nFor B locus:\n\n- BB:25%\n- Bb:50%\n- bb:25%\n\nNow, combining:\n\nEach F2 individual is a combination of C and B genotypes.\n\nThe number of Checkered Red individuals is CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 (25% \u00d725%) = 6.25% of the population.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered Brown is CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% \u00d750% =12.5%.\n\nPlain Red is cc \u00d7 BB \u219225% \u00d725% =6.25%.\n\nPlain Brown is cc \u00d7 Bb \u219225% \u00d750% =12.5%.\n\nSo the proportions are approximately 6.25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 12.5%. Adding up to 37.5% each for Checkered and Plain, and 25% each for Brown.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this exact distribution. The closest option is D, which has 1:3:9:3, but that's a different pattern.\n\nHmm, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided suggest that the correct ratio is among A to H, with each having specific counts.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation is from the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nIn F1, we have 50% CcBb and 50% ccbb.\n\nSo, F2 would be the result of F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nCalculating F2:\n\nEach parent is CcBb and ccbb.\n\nF1 \u00d7 F1 cross:\n\nFor C locus:\n\nCcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 Cc (from each parent) \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nWait, no. Each parent is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for C and a heterozygote for B.\n\nSo, for C locus: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nFor B locus: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSo, F2 genotypes:\n\n25% CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n25% CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n25% CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Ccbb (Checkered Brown)\n25% Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBB (Checkered Red)\n25% Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n25% Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Ccbb (Checkered Brown)\n25% cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 ccBB (Plain Red)\n25% cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 ccBb (Plain Brown)\n25% cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccbb (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, that's more accurate. Now, categorizing:\n\nCheckered Red: CCBB, CcBB, CcBb, CcBb \u2192 4 cases\nCheckered Brown: CcBB, CcBb, CcBb \u2192 3 cases\nPlain Red: ccBB \u2192 1 case\nPlain Brown: ccBb, ccBb \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo, total:\n\nCheckered Red: 4/9 (approx 44.44%)\nCheckered Brown: 3/9 (33.33%)\nPlain Red: 1/9 (approx 11.11%)\nPlain Brown: 2/9 (approx 22.22%)\n\nBut none of the options match this. The closest is option D: 1:3:9:3, which is the 9:3:3:1 ratio for a dihybrid cross without dominance.\n\nHowever, in this case, since both B and C are codominant (as Bb and Cc are expressed), the phenotypic ratios change.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, only the presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype, not the dominance itself. So, even though B and C are codominant, the phenotypes remain as per the dominance hierarchy: B > b, C > c.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio based on F2 would be:\n\nCheckered Red: 4 cases\nCheckered Brown: 3 cases\nPlain Red: 1 case\nPlain Brown: 2 cases\n\nWhich totals 10. But wait, 4+3+1+2=10, which is less than 16. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, no. In F2, the total number of individuals is 16 (since each locus has 4 possibilities, 2x2=4, multiplied together: 4x4=16).\n\nSo, 4 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 2 Plain Brown. Total: 10. That doesn't make sense because 16 individuals shouldn't add up to 10. I must have overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the cases.\n\nLet me list all 16 possibilities:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, now adding them up:\n\nCheckered Red: 1,4 \u2192 2\nCheckered Brown: 2,3,5,6 \u2192 4\nPlain Red:7 \u21921",

One bird is a checkered red bird, which means it's heterozygous for both genes\u2014so its genotype would be CcBb. The other bird is plain brown, meaning it's homozygous recessive in both traits\u2014so its genotype is ccbb.\n\nWe need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two birds. Wait, hold on\u2014is that correct? Because usually, an adihybrid cross refers to a self-pollination, but here it says an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous bird and another bird. Hmm, maybe they're referring to a cross where one parent is a dihybrid (CcBB) and the other is a monohybrid (ccbb), but no\u2014that doesn't fit because the parents given are CcBB and ccbb. So perhaps it's a cross between two different genotypes.\n\nWait, actually, the user provided the\u7236\u6bcd as CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which makes sense. So each bird has four alleles: two from each parent, making their genotypes. Now, let's think about what we're supposed to do. We need to make a Punnett square for the F1 generation, then analyze the F2 generation to find the phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Identify the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: CCBB \u2192 C (dominant, checkered red) and B (dominant, red)\n   - Parent 2: ccbb \u2192 c (recessive, plain) and b (recessive, brown)\n\n2. Determine the gametes each parent can produce.\n   - Parent 1 can produce four types of gametes:\n     - CB (from CC and BB)\n     - CB (again, since both C and B are dominant)\n     - cb (from cc and bb)\n     - cb\n   But wait, since both alleles are dominant, all gametes from Parent 1 will be CB or cb.\n\n   - Parent 2 can only produce gametes:\n     - cB (from cc and bb)\n     - cb (from cc and bb)\n\nBut actually, wait\u2014the parents' genotypes are CCBB and ccbb. So Parent 1 is CCBB, meaning all their gametes will be CB. Parent 2 is ccbb, so all their gametes will be cb. Therefore, when they mate, all F1 will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, resulting in CcBb.\n\nSo the F1 generation will all be CcBb. Now, we need to consider the F2 generation, which comes from the F1 individuals mated among themselves. So each F1 individual is CcBb, and we'll look at their offspring.\n\nNext, let's determine the possible gametes from each F1 individual. Since C and c are alleles, and B and b are dominant, the gametes will be a combination of these. Each F1 bird is CcBb, so they can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- C_B_ (C B)\n- C_b_ (C b)\n- _c_B (c B)\n- _c_b (c b)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of each type of gamete. Since C and c are alleles, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of C and c should be p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, respectively. Similarly for B and b: p = 0.5, q = 0.5. \n\nFor Cc, the probability of producing each gamete is 50% C and 50% c. Similarly for BB, Bb, and bb. However, since we have two loci (two genes), the probabilities combine. So for each gene, the alleles are independent, so the total gamete types are combinations of the alleles from each gene.\n\nTherefore, the possible gametes from CcBb are:\n\n- C B: (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n- C b: (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n- c B: (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n- c b: (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n\nWait, that seems off. Actually, the probabilities aren't exactly 25% each because the genes might not be independent if there's any linkage or epistasis, but the problem states nothing like that, so I'll assume independence. Thus, each gamete has a 25% chance.\n\nNow, when these F1 individuals (CcBb) mate among themselves, each can produce any of the four types of gametes with equal probability (25%). Therefore, the F2 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these gametes.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square, we list all possible combinations of the gametes from each parent. Since each F1 bird contributes one gamete, and there are two F1s, the square will have 4 x 4 = 16 cells.\n\nLet's map the gametes:\n\nGametes from Parent 1 (first F1): C B, C b, c B, c b (each 25%)\n\nGametes from Parent 2 (second F1): same as above.\n\nSo the Punnett square will have rows and columns representing each gamete from each parent. Each cell represents the combination of gametes from each parent.\n\nNow, let's fill in the Punnett square:\n\nTop row (Parent 1):\n1. C B\n2. C b\n3. c B\n4. c b\n\nLeft column (Parent 2):\nA. C B\nB. C b\nC. c B\nD. c b\n\nEach intersection represents the offspring genotype.\n\nNow, let's compute the phenotypes based on the genotypes and dominance hierarchy.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant alleles mask recessive ones.\n- Order matters: C > c, B > b.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CCBB \u2192 All dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B is dominant over b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown?\nWait, no. Wait, if a bird is CCbb, then the alleles are C (dominant), C (dominant), b (recessive). So the phenotype depends on whether dominant alleles are present. In this case, since C is present, it would be Checkered Red. Wait, no. Wait, if a bird is CCbb, the dominant alleles are C and B. So the phenotype would be Checkered Brown, because B is dominant over b, even though the other C is present.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird is CCbb, then:\n\n- The presence of C means it's Checkered (since C is dominant).\n- The presence of B means it's Brown (since B is dominant).\n\nThus, the phenotype would be Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- CcBB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- ccBB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Red\n- ccBb \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccbb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, the dominance order is C > c and B > b. So any bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene will express the corresponding trait. So for example:\n\n- If a bird is CC, regardless of the second gene, it's Checkered.\n- If it's CB, regardless of the second gene, it's Checkered.\n- If it's Cb, it's Checkered.\n- If it's cb, it's Plain.\n\nSame logic applies to B and b:\n\n- Any B allele makes it Brown, regardless of b.\n- Any b allele makes it Plain.\n\nSo, combining both genes, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nThus, for each genotype:\n\n1. CCBB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Only dominant C \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. CcBB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. CcBb \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Ccbb \u2192 Only dominant C \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. ccBB \u2192 Only recessive c \u2192 Plain Red\n8. ccBb \u2192 Only recessive c \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. ccbb \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nFrom the 16 possible offspring:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Offspring\n--- | ---\nCheckered Red | Genotypes: CCBB, CcBB \u2192 2 each? Wait, no. Let me recount.\n\nLooking back:\n\nGenotypes leading to Checkered Red:\n\nCCBB \u2192 1\nCcBB \u2192 1\nCcBB \u2192 another?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nActually, looking back:\n\nIn the Punnett square, each cell represents one offspring. So:\n\n- CCBB \u2192 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 1\n- CC bb \u2192 1\n- CcBB \u2192 1\n- CcBb \u2192 1\n- Ccbb \u2192 1\n- ccBB \u2192 1\n- ccBb \u2192 1\n- ccbb \u2192 1\n\nWait, that's nine, but we need 16. Oh, I missed some.\n\nWait, no.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it carefully first.\n\nThe question involves two birds crossing. One bird is a checkered red bird, which means it's heterozygous for both genes\u2014so its genotype would be CcBb. The other bird is plain brown, meaning it's homozygous recessive in both traits\u2014so its genotype is ccbb.\n\nWe need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two birds. Wait, hold on\u2014is that correct? Because usually, an adihybrid cross refers to a self-pollination, but here it says an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous bird and another bird. Hmm, maybe they're referring to a cross where one parent is a dihybrid (CcBB) and the other is a monohybrid (ccbb), but no\u2014that doesn't fit because the parents given are CcBB and ccbb. So perhaps it's a cross between two different genotypes.\n\nWait, actually, the user provided the\u7236\u6bcd as CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which makes sense. So each bird has four alleles: two from each parent, making their genotypes. Now, let's think about what we're supposed to do. We need to make a Punnett square for the F1 generation, then analyze the F2 generation to find the phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Identify the genotypes of the parents.\n   - Parent 1: CCBB \u2192 C (dominant, checkered red) and B (dominant, red)\n   - Parent 2: ccbb \u2192 c (recessive, plain) and b (recessive, brown)\n\n2. Determine the gametes each parent can produce.\n   - Parent 1 can produce four types of gametes:\n     - CB (from CC and BB)\n     - CB (again, since both C and B are dominant)\n     - cb (from cc and bb)\n     - cb\n   But wait, since both alleles are dominant, all gametes from Parent 1 will be CB or cb.\n\n   - Parent 2 can only produce gametes:\n     - cB (from cc and bb)\n     - cb (from cc and bb)\n\nBut actually, wait\u2014the parents' genotypes are CCBB and ccbb. So Parent 1 is CCBB, meaning all their gametes will be CB. Parent 2 is ccbb, so all their gametes will be cb. Therefore, when they mate, all F1 will receive CB from Parent 1 and cb from Parent 2, resulting in CcBb.\n\nSo the F1 generation will all be CcBb. Now, we need to consider the F2 generation, which comes from the F1 individuals mated among themselves. So each F1 individual is CcBb, and we'll look at their offspring.\n\nNext, let's determine the possible gametes from each F1 individual. Since C and c are alleles, and B and b are dominant, the gametes will be a combination of these. Each F1 bird is CcBb, so they can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- C_B_ (C B)\n- C_b_ (C b)\n- _c_B (c B)\n- _c_b (c b)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the frequency of each type of gamete. Since C and c are alleles, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of C and c should be p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, respectively. Similarly for B and b: p = 0.5, q = 0.5. \n\nFor Cc, the probability of producing each gamete is 50% C and 50% c. Similarly for BB, Bb, and bb. However, since we have two loci (two genes), the probabilities combine. So for each gene, the alleles are independent, so the total gamete types are combinations of the alleles from each gene.\n\nTherefore, the possible gametes from CcBb are:\n\n- C B: (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n- C b: (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n- c B: (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n- c b: (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%\n\nWait, that seems off. Actually, the probabilities aren't exactly 25% each because the genes might not be independent if there's any linkage or epistasis, but the problem states nothing like that, so I'll assume independence. Thus, each gamete has a 25% chance.\n\nNow, when these F1 individuals (CcBb) mate among themselves, each can produce any of the four types of gametes with equal probability (25%). Therefore, the F2 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these gametes.\n\nTo construct the Punnett square, we list all possible combinations of the gametes from each parent. Since each F1 bird contributes one gamete, and there are two F1s, the square will have 4 x 4 = 16 cells.\n\nLet's map the gametes:\n\nGametes from Parent 1 (first F1): C B, C b, c B, c b (each 25%)\n\nGametes from Parent 2 (second F1): same as above.\n\nSo the Punnett square will have rows and columns representing each gamete from each parent. Each cell represents the combination of gametes from each parent.\n\nNow, let's fill in the Punnett square:\n\nTop row (Parent 1):\n1. C B\n2. C b\n3. c B\n4. c b\n\nLeft column (Parent 2):\nA. C B\nB. C b\nC. c B\nD. c b\n\nEach intersection represents the offspring genotype.\n\nNow, let's compute the phenotypes based on the genotypes and dominance hierarchy.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant alleles mask recessive ones.\n- Order matters: C > c, B > b.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CCBB \u2192 All dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B is dominant over b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown?\nWait, no. Wait, if a bird is CCbb, then the alleles are C (dominant), C (dominant), b (recessive). So the phenotype depends on whether dominant alleles are present. In this case, since C is present, it would be Checkered Red. Wait, no. Wait, if a bird is CCbb, the dominant alleles are C and B. So the phenotype would be Checkered Brown, because B is dominant over b, even though the other C is present.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird is CCbb, then:\n\n- The presence of C means it's Checkered (since C is dominant).\n- The presence of B means it's Brown (since B is dominant).\n\nThus, the phenotype would be Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- CcBB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- ccBB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Red\n- ccBb \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccbb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, the dominance order is C > c and B > b. So any bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene will express the corresponding trait. So for example:\n\n- If a bird is CC, regardless of the second gene, it's Checkered.\n- If it's CB, regardless of the second gene, it's Checkered.\n- If it's Cb, it's Checkered.\n- If it's cb, it's Plain.\n\nSame logic applies to B and b:\n\n- Any B allele makes it Brown, regardless of b.\n- Any b allele makes it Plain.\n\nSo, combining both genes, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nThus, for each genotype:\n\n1. CCBB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Only dominant C \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. CcBB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. CcBb \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Ccbb \u2192 Only dominant C \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. ccBB \u2192 Only recessive c \u2192 Plain Red\n8. ccBb \u2192 Only recessive c \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. ccbb \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nFrom the 16 possible offspring:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Offspring\n--- | ---\nCheckered Red | Genotypes: CCBB, CcBB \u2192 2 each? Wait, no. Let me recount.\n\nLooking back:\n\nGenotypes leading to Checkered Red:\n\nCCBB \u2192 1\nCcBB \u2192 1\nCcBB \u2192 another?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nActually, looking back:\n\nIn the Punnett square, each cell represents one offspring. So:\n\n- CCBB \u2192 1\n- CC Bb \u2192 1\n- CC bb \u2192 1\n- CcBB \u2192 1\n- CcBb \u2192 1\n- Ccbb \u2192 1\n- ccBB \u2192 1\n- ccBb \u2192 1\n- ccbb \u2192 1\n\nWait, that's nine, but we need 16. Oh, I missed some.\n\nWait, no. Each cell is an offspring, so there are 4x4=16.\n\nWait, let me count again properly:\n\nLooking at the Punnett square:\n\nTop left (Parent 1 gamete C B pairing with Parent 2 gamete C B):\n\n- C B + C B \u2192 C C B B \u2192 CCBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nTop middle (C B paired with C b):\n\n- C B + C b \u2192 C C B b \u2192 CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nTop right (C B paired with c B):\n\n- C B + c B \u2192 C C B B \u2192 CC BB? No, wait: C B (from Parent 1) and c B (from Parent 2). So the offspring genotype is C c (from C and c) and B B (from B and B). So CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nMiddle left (C B paired with c b):\n\n- C B + c b \u2192 C c (from C and c) and B b (from B and b) \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nMiddle right (C B paired with c b):\n\n- C B + c b \u2192 C c (from C and c) and B b (from B and b) \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nBottom left (C b paired with C B):\n\n- C b + C B \u2192 C C (from C and C) and b B (from b and B) \u2192 CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nBottom middle (C b paired with C b):\n\n- C b + C b \u2192 CC (from C and C) and bb (from b and b) \u2192 CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nBottom right (C b paired with c B):\n\n- C b + c B \u2192 C c (from C and c) and b B (from b and B) \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nBottom left (C b paired with c b):\n\n- C b + c b \u2192 CC (from C and c?) Wait, no, each parent contributes one allele per gene. So for C b paired with c B:\n\n- Gene A: C (from C b) and c (from c B) \u2192 Cc\n- Gene B: b (from C b) and B (from c B) \u2192 Bb\nThus, genotype CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but according to my earlier analysis, CcBb should be Checkered Brown. Yes.\n\nNow, compiling the counts:\n\nCheckered Red: CCBB, CcBB, CC BB, CC BB? Wait, no, looking back:\n\n- CCBB \u2192 1\n- CcBB \u2192 1\n- CC BB \u2192 Another occurrence?

So the possible combinations are:\n\nFor each F1 gamete, there are four possibilities, so 4 x 4 = 16.\n\nNow, mapping each combination:\n\n1.

They're crossing these two birds, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation along with some genotype and frequency data.\n\nFirst, let me break down what each symbol means:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant allele \u2192 Checkered red (since the bird is checkered).\n- c: Recessive allele \u2192 Plain red.\n- Gene B: Dominant allele \u2192 Red (since the bird's color is red).\n- b: Recessive allele \u2192 Brown.\n\nSo, the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (for gene C) and BB (for gene B) \u2192 CCBB \u2192 Checkered red.\n- Parent 2: cc (for gene c) and bb (for gene b) \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nNow, when they mate, the first thing is to find their offspring's genotypes using a Punnett square. Since both parents are homozygous, all their offspring will be CcBB (from Parent 1) and cb from Parent 2? Wait no, that's not right. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene:\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 Genes C and B are both dominant.\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 Genes c and b are both recessive.\n\nWhen they mate, the possible gametes from Parent 1 are CB and CB (since both alleles are dominant). Similarly, gametes from Parent 2 are cb (since both are recessive).\n\nSo, the F1 generation would be:\n\n- From Parent 1: CB \u00d7 Parent 2: cb \u2192 Each gamete combines as CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals have the same genotype: CcBb.\n\nNow, since F1 is homozygous (because it's the result of a self-fertilization), they can produce F2 offspring through a regular dihybrid cross.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think differently because sometimes F1 might be different. However, given the parents are both homozygous, F1 should also be heterozygous if they are parents of each other.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.\n\nEach parent produces gametes based on their alleles. Parent 1 (CCBB): since both C and B are dominant, any gamete will carry either C or B. But since both are dominant, all gametes from Parent 1 are CB.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (ccbb): both c and b are recessive, so all gametes are cb.\n\nThus, the F1 generation would be all CcBb.\n\nSince F1 is CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation can be calculated using the Punnett square method.\n\nThe F1 will self-mate to produce F2. So, let's construct the Punnett square.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb. When they self-pollinate, each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Probability of CC = 25%\n- Probability of Cc = 50%\n- Probability of cc = 25%\n\nFor gene B:\n- Probability of BB = 25%\n- Probability of Bb = 50%\n- Probability of bb = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities for each combination.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of these probabilities.\n\nNow, for each gene, the possible outcomes are:\n\nGene C: CC, Cc, cc\nGene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nTo get the phenotype, we combine these:\n\n- If C is present (CC, Cc), and B is present (BB, Bb), the bird is Checkered Red.\n- If C is present but B is absent (BB), it's Checkered Brown.\n- If C is absent (cc), then regardless of B, it's Plain Red.\n- If C is absent and B is present (bb), it's Plain Brown.\n\nSo, let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, count how many of each genotype there are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: 50% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb: 25% \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: 50% \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb: 25% \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb: 25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, calculate the number assuming 100 flies:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25 + 25 + 25 = 75\n- Checkered Brown: 50 + 50 = 100 (Wait, no: CC Bb is 50%, Cc Bb is another 50%.

Let me see the options again.\n\nOptions A to H give specific ratios. Let me look at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.

Sums to 16.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sums to 16.\n\nLooking back at my calculation, I got:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75%\n- Checkered Brown: 50%\n- Plain Red: 75%\n- Plain Brown: 50%\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 75 : 50 : 75 : 50\n\nSimplify by dividing by 25: 3 : 2 : 3 : 2\n\nSo, the ratio is 3:2:3:2.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Looking again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Ratios: 1:3:9:3, which simplifies to 1:3:9:3, but that doesn't align with our 3:2:3:2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question refers to the actual counts rather than percentages. Let me recalculate the actual numbers assuming 16 flies (since some options have smaller numbers):\n\nIf 16 flies:\n\n- Checkered Red: 6 (25% of 16)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (50% of 16)\n- Plain Red: 6 (25%)\n- Plain Brown: 2 (50%)\n\nTotal: 16.\n\nThat matches option A: 6, 2, 6, 2.\n\nBut according to my previous calculation, it was 75% checkered red, etc., which would mean more than 16 flies. So perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Wait, the original parents were:\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 So C and B are dominant, meaning both alleles are dominant. Thus, all gametes are CB.\n\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 All gametes are cb.\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb. Then, F2 is the dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the F2 ratios. Let me redo the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes properly.\n\nGenotype for C: CC, Cc, cc \u2192 25%, 50%, 25%.\n\nSame for B: BB, Bb, bb \u2192 25%, 50%, 25%.\n\nSo, combining them:\n\nFor each combination of C and B:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nCalculating the proportions:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB (6.25%), CC Bb (12.5%) \u2192 Total 18.75%?\nWait, no. Each genotype has its own percentage. So:\n\nCheckered Red: 6.25% (from CC BB) + 12.5% (from Cc BB) = 18.75%\n\nCheckered Brown: 12.5% (CC Bb) + 25% (Cc Bb) = 37.5%\n\nPlain Red: 6.25% (CC bb) + 12.5% (Cc bb) = 18.75%\n\nPlain Brown: 6.25% (cc BB) + 12.5% (cc Bb) = 18.75%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 18.75% : 37.5% : 18.75% : 18.75%\n\nSimplifying by multiplying by 100 to eliminate decimals: 18.75 : 37.5 : 18.75 : 18.75\n\nDivide each by 18.75: 1 : 2 : 1 : 1\n\nSo, Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 1 : 2 : 1 : 1\n\nThis ratio corresponds to checking the options:\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Ratios: 1:3:9:3, which isn't matching.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Which is 3:1:3:1, not 1:2:1:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is considering the actual counts without scaling to 100, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including those from F1 being crossed with themselves, but F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would include all possible gametes from F1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the actual dihybrid cross without considering dominance, which complicates things. But in reality, dominance affects the phenotypes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which is a 1:3:9:3 ratio. This suggests that the parents are considered as homozygous for both traits, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio in the F2.\n\nWait, but in reality, the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which are not both homozygous for both traits. So, that approach might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given the confusion, I'll go with the most logical answer based on the correct calculations, even though it doesn't perfectly match the options provided.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

So:\n\nCheckered Red: 6.25% (from CC BB) + 12.5% (from Cc BB) = 18.75%\n\nCheckered Brown: 12.5% (CC Bb) + 25% (Cc Bb) = 37.5%\n\nPlain Red: 6.25% (CC bb) + 12.5% (Cc bb) = 18.75%\n\nPlain Brown: 6.25% (cc BB) + 12.5% (cc Bb) = 18.75%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 18.75% : 37.5% : 18.75% : 18.75%\n\nSimplifying by multiplying by 100 to eliminate decimals: 18.75 : 37.5 : 18.75 : 18.75\n\nDivide each by 18.75: 1 : 2 : 1 : 1\n\nSo, Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 1 : 2 : 1 : 1\n\nThis ratio corresponds to checking the options:\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Ratios: 1:3:9:3, which isn't matching.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Which is 3:1:3:1, not 1:2:1:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is considering the actual counts without scaling to 100, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including those from F1 being crossed with themselves, but F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would include all possible gametes from F1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the actual dihybrid cross without considering dominance, which complicates things. But in reality, dominance affects the phenotypes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which is a 1:3:9:3 ratio. This suggests that the parents are considered as homozygous for both traits, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio in the F2.\n\nWait, but in reality, the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which are not both homozygous for both traits. So, that approach might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given the confusion, I'll go with the most logical answer based on the correct calculations, even though it doesn't perfectly match the options provided.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Oh, no, wait\u2014the first part is about figuring out the correct options based on the given information.\n\nThe key here is to understand how each bird contributes gametes and then predict the F2 generation's phenotype distribution. So let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the parents are:\n\n1. Checkered red bird: This is heterozygous for both genes. So the genotype would be CC (for the C and c alleles at the dominance-recessive relationship) and BB (for B and b). Wait, no\u2014wait, each bird has two copies of each gene, right? So the checkered red bird must be CC for the dominant C and BB for the dominant B. Because if it were Cc, that's heterozygous, but since it's checkered, which suggests it's CC (since 'checkered' might imply two dominant alleles), and 'red' is probably from the C and c alleles\u2014if it's Cc, the color might be more red or something else. Wait, but the problem states that checkered color is due to a dominant gene C, so perhaps it's CC because 'checkered' implies two dominant alleles, making it look like they're not pure. Hmm, maybe I should assume it's CC for simplicity.\n\nWait, the checkered red bird is described as having a dominant C and a recessive c, but also having a dominant B and recessive b. That seems confusing because typically, a bird's color depends on both pairs of genes. Maybe I need to clarify. Perhaps the bird is CC (dominant for C) and BB (dominant for B), resulting in a checkered appearance. Alternatively, maybe it's CC for the C gene and bb for the b gene, giving a dark brown or something. Hmm, I think I'll proceed under the assumption that the checkered red bird is CC (for C) and BB (for B), leading to a checkered phenotype.\n\nThe other parent is a plain brown bird. Plain means the recessive alleles are present, and brown is the dominant. So the genotype would be cc (recessive for C) and bb (recessive for B), resulting in a plain brown phenotype.\n\nNow, we're looking to cross these two birds. One is CC BB (checkered red), and the other is cc bb (plain brown).\n\nLet's set up the Punnett square for this cross. Since both parents are homozygous for their respective alleles, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of their gametes.\n\nEach parent can produce gametes: CC (from the checkered red bird) and cc (from the plain brown bird). Similarly, for the B and b genes: BB and bb.\n\nSo the F1 generation will have four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (checkered red)\n- CC bb (checkered brown)\n- cc BB (plain red)\n- cc bb (plain brown)\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions an F2 generation, so maybe the initial cross is between F1 and F1, producing F2. However, the user provided a detailed list of gametes and F1s, which may include some confusion. Let me check again.\n\nThe gametes mentioned are (CB), (cb), and (cB), (cb). Wait, CB would mean C and B, cb would be c and b, etc. But perhaps the initial cross is between a heterozygous parent (CCBB \u00d7 ccbb), resulting in F1 generation, and then F1 selfing to get F2.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps the cross is F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nAlternatively, the initial cross is between a heterozygous parent (CCBB \u00d7 ccbb) to get F1, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 to get F2. But the user's description seems a bit unclear.\n\nWait, let me read the user's message again.\n\nThey provided a list of gametes for CCBB and ccbb:\n\nGametes:\n(CB), (cb)\nSo F1s would be CC (from CCBB) and cc (from ccbb), and also Cc and cB?\n\nWait, CCBB is heterozygous for C and B, while ccbb is homozygous recessive for both. So when crossed, the F1s would be:\n\n- From CC \u00d7 cc: Cc\n- From CC \u00d7 cc: Cc\n- From BB \u00d7 bb: Bb\n- From BB \u00d7 bb: Bb\n\nSo the F1s would be CcBB, Ccbb, CcBB, Ccbb. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Actually, each parent produces gametes independently. So CCBB can produce CC, Cc, cC, cc, and similarly, ccbb can produce cc, cb, bc, bb. But since Cc and cb are the same, perhaps the F1s are CcBB, Ccbb, cCBB, cCbb, etc., but duplicates may exist.\n\nHowever, perhaps it's better to focus on the F2 generation. The user wants to know the phenotypic ratio in F2, so let's proceed accordingly.\n\nThe F1 generation is likely CcBB, Ccbb, cCBB, cCbb, etc., but perhaps the exact breakdown isn't necessary yet. Instead, focusing on the F2 generation, which results from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nTo find the F2 generation, we need to consider the F1 parents. Assuming the F1 parents are CcBB and Ccbb, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the F1 parents are CcBB and Ccbb, which could lead to different F2 outcomes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the F2 generation using the F1 parents. Each F1 bird is CcBB and Ccbb. When crossed, the F2 will have a certain number of genotypes, which can then be categorized into phenotypes.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler approach. Let's consider the parents as CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). When crossed, the F1s would be CcBB, Ccbb, cCBB, cCbb, etc., but without considering the actual gamete types beyond the cross itself, perhaps the F1s are all CcBB, Ccbb, etc., but perhaps the key is to calculate the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSince each bird is independent, the F2 will involve the combination of both genes. Let's model each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Gene C:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (homozygous dominant)\n- Parent 2: cc (homozygous recessive)\nCrossing them: F1 will all be Cc, and F2 will be C (from C\u00d7c) and c (from c\u00d7C). So the probability of C in F2 is 50%, and c is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\n\n- Parent 1: BB (homozygous dominant)\n- Parent 2: bb (homozygous recessive)\nCrossing them: F1 will all be Bb, and F2 will be B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have a 25% chance of each combination of C and B alleles.\n\nNow, combining these, the possible genotypes for each bird are:\n\n- CcBb (dominant C and dominant B)\n- Ccbb (dominant C and recessive B)\n- ccBB (recessive C and dominant B)\n- ccbb (recessive C and recessive B)\n\nNext, determining the phenotypes based on the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Dominant C and Dominant B \u2192 Checkered Red (since checkered is dominant for C and brown for B, perhaps)\n- Dominant C and Recessive B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Recessive C and Dominant B \u2192 Plain Red\n- Recessive C and Recessive B \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nGiven that, now let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Probability of C=dominant and B=dominant: 25%\n- C=dominant and B=recessive: 25%\n- C=recessive and B=dominant: 25%\n- C=recessive and B=recessive: 25%\n\nSo each phenotype occurs 25% of the time.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match our calculation where each phenotype is equally likely.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption about the phenotype mapping was incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern is dominant for C.\n- Red color is dominant for B.\n- Brown is dominant for b.\n\nWait, but the way the phenotypes are presented is based on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered red would require dominant C and dominant B \u2192 C B\n- Checkered brown \u2192 C b\n- Plain red \u2192 cc B (but wait, brown is dominant, so if B is present, the bird is brown, unless b is dominant. Wait, the problem says brown is dominant for b, meaning that b is recessive for brown. So if a bird has at least one b allele, it's brown, otherwise red.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele (B), it expresses brown. If it has at least one recessive allele (b), it expresses red.\n\nSimilarly, for the C gene:\n\n- Dominant C (C_) \u2192 checkered\n- Recessive c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n1. Presence of B (B_): Brown\n   - Presence of C (C_): Checkered\n   - Therefore, Brown Checkered (C_B_)\n2. Presence of B (B_): Brown\n   - Absence of C (cc): Plain Red\n3. Absence of B (bb): Red\n   - Presence of C (C_): Checkered\n   - Therefore, Brown Plain (Cc_bb)\n4. Absence of B (bb): Red\n   - Absence of C (cc): Plain Brown (cc_bb)\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the colors are determined by the alleles, so:\n\n- If the bird is C_, it's checkered. If it's cc, plain.\n- If the bird is B_, it's brown. If it's bb, red.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- C_ B_: Brown Checkered\n- C_ bb: Brown Plain\n- cc B_: Red Checkered\n- cc bb: Red Plain\n\nNow, the F2 generation has a 25% chance for each genotype:\n\n- C_ B_: 25%\n- C_ bb: 25%\n- cc B_: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be equally distributed among the four categories.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none directly say 1:1:1:1. The closest option is A, B, D, E, G, H, etc., which don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 generation. Let me double-check.\n\nAssuming the parents are CCBB and ccbb:\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be:\n\n- From CC \u00d7 cc: CC and cc \u2192 Cc\n- From BB \u00d7 bb: BB and bb \u2192 Bb\n\nSo F1 genotypes would be CcBB, Ccbb, CcBB, etc., but without duplication, perhaps each F1 bird is CcBB, Ccbb, CcBB, etc., but overall, the F1 would have the following:\n\nEach bird is Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB) or Cc and bb (from cc \u00d7 BB?), wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to model it as:\n\nParent 1: CC (homozygous dominant for C) \u00d7 cc (homozygous recessive for C)\nParent 2: BB (homozygous dominant for B) \u00d7 bb (homozygous recessive for B)\n\nCrossing these, the F1 would be:\n\n- Cc (from CC \u00d7 cc)\n- BB (from BB \u00d7 bb)\n\u2192 CcBB\n- Cc (from CC \u00d7 cc)\n- bb (from cc \u00d7 BB)\n\u2192 Ccbb\n- cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n- BB (from cc \u00d7 BB)\n\u2192 ccBB (which would be plain red)\n- cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n- bb (from cc \u00d7 bb)\n\u2192 ccbb (plain brown)\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, ccbb.\n\nThen, F2 would result from crossing F1 with F1.\n\nCalculating the F2:\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes based on its genotype.\n\nFor example, CcBB bird can produce:\n\n- CC (50%)\n- Cc (25%)\n- Cc (25%)\n- BB (0%)\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two copies of each gene. For CcBB:\n\n- For C gene: 50% C, 50% c\n- For B gene: 100% B (since it's homozygous)\n\nSo the gametes for CcBB would be C (50%) and c (50%).\n\nFor ccBB bird (from cc \u00d7 BB):\n\n- For C gene: 100% c\n- For B gene: 100% B\n\u2192 Gametes: B\n\nFor ccBB bird, same as above.\n\nFor ccbb bird (from cc \u00d7 bb):\n\n- For C gene: 100% c\n- For B gene: 50% B, 50% b\n\u2192 Gametes: B (50%), b (50%)\n\nPutting it all together, the F2 generation will have various combinations:\n\nLet's compute the F2 genotypes.\n\nEach F1 bird can contribute either C, c, B, or b, depending on their genotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each F1 bird is CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, or ccbb, their gametes vary.\n\nThis is getting complex, but perhaps a better approach is to recognize that the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios based on the F1 parents.\n\nBut given that the F1 parents are CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, their F2 will have:\n\nFor the C gene: F1 is Cc, so F2 will be C (50%) and c (50%).\nFor the B gene: F1 is BB, so F2 will be B (100%).\n\nThus, the F2 for B is always B.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes for the C gene will be:\n\n- C_ : 50% (C c C c)\n- cc : 50% (c c c c)\n\nAnd since B is always B, the phenotypes are determined solely by the C gene:\n\n- C_ B_: Brown Checkered\n- cc B_: Red Checkered\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene, since F2 has B always expressed, the phenotypes are:\n\n- B_ : Brown\n- bb : Red\n\nSo combining both genes:\n\n- Brown Checkered (C_ B_): 50% of the population\n- Red Checkered (cc B_): 50% of the population\n- Brown Plain (C_ bb): 50% of the population\n- Red Plain (cc bb): 50% of the population\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are equal across the four categories.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none exactly match 1:1:1:1. The closest is option A: 6, 2, 6, 2. Option B: 8,4,0,4. Option D: 1,3,9,3. Option E: 3,9,1,3. Option J: 2,6,3,1.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recount the F2 population.\n\nIn F2, the proportion of each phenotype is:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 25% of all birds (C_ B_)\n- Brown Plain: 25% (C_ bb)\n- Red Checkered: 25% (cc B_)\n- Red Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n\nTotal: 25% + 25% = 50% for Brown, 50% for Red.\n\nWithin Brown:\n\n- 50% Checkered (C_ B_)\n- 50% Plain (cc B_)\n\nSame within Red:\n\n- 50% Checkered (cc B_)\n- 50% Plain (cc bb)\n\nSo the total counts are:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 25% of total\n- Brown Plain: 25% of total\n- Red Checkered: 25% of total\n- Red Plain: 25% of total\n\nWhich gives a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking at the options again, none provide 1:1:1:1. The closest is option A, which is 6,2,6,2, totaling 16, but that's incorrect because each category should add up to 16. Wait, perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nWait, no\u2014the options are just the numbers, not necessarily percentages. Let me see:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 18\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\n\nAh, so the totals per option are varying. Only options A, B, C, D, E, J, G, H sum to 16. The correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, but none of the options have that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio as count per phenotype rather than percentage. Let me recalculate the counts.\n\nIn F2, assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Brown Checkered: ",

Alternatively, perhaps the F1 parents are CcBB and Ccbb, which could lead to different F2 outcomes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the F2 generation using the F1 parents. Each F1 bird is CcBB and Ccbb. When crossed, the F2 will have a certain number of genotypes, which can then be categorized into phenotypes.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler approach. Let's consider the parents as CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). When crossed, the F1s would be CcBB, Ccbb, cCBB, cCbb, etc., but without considering the actual gamete types beyond the cross itself, perhaps the F1s are all CcBB, Ccbb, etc., but perhaps the key is to calculate the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSince each bird is independent, the F2 will involve the combination of both genes. Let's model each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Gene C:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (homozygous dominant)\n- Parent 2: cc (homozygous recessive)\nCrossing them: F1 will all be Cc, and F2 will be C (from C\u00d7c) and c (from c\u00d7C). So the probability of C in F2 is 50%, and c is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\n\n- Parent 1: BB (homozygous dominant)\n- Parent 2: bb (homozygous recessive)\nCrossing them: F1 will all be Bb, and F2 will be B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have a 25% chance of each combination of C and B alleles.\n\nNow, combining these, the possible genotypes for each bird are:\n\n- CcBb (dominant C and dominant B)\n- Ccbb (dominant C and recessive B)\n- ccBB (recessive C and dominant B)\n- ccbb (recessive C and recessive B)\n\nNext, determining the phenotypes based on the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Dominant C and Dominant B \u2192 Checkered Red (since checkered is dominant for C and brown for B, perhaps)\n- Dominant C and Recessive B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Recessive C and Dominant B \u2192 Plain Red\n- Recessive C and Recessive B \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nGiven that, now let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Probability of C=dominant and B=dominant: 25%\n- C=dominant and B=recessive: 25%\n- C=recessive and B=dominant: 25%\n- C=recessive and B=recessive: 25%\n\nSo each phenotype occurs 25% of the time.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match our calculation where each phenotype is equally likely.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption about the phenotype mapping was incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern is dominant for C.\n- Red color is dominant for B.\n- Brown is dominant for b.\n\nWait, but the way the phenotypes are presented is based on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered red would require dominant C and dominant B \u2192 C B\n- Checkered brown \u2192 C b\n- Plain red \u2192 cc B (but wait, brown is dominant, so if B is present, the bird is brown, unless b is dominant. Wait, the problem says brown is dominant for b, meaning that b is recessive for brown. So if a bird has at least one b allele, it's brown, otherwise red.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele (B), it expresses brown. If it has at least one recessive allele (b), it expresses red.\n\nSimilarly, for the C gene:\n\n- Dominant C (C_) \u2192 checkered\n- Recessive c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n1. Presence of B (B_): Brown\n   - Presence of C (C_): Checkered\n   - Therefore, Brown Checkered (C_B_)\n2. Presence of B (B_): Brown\n   - Absence of C (cc): Plain Red\n3. Absence of B (bb): Red\n   - Presence of C (C_): Checkered\n   - Therefore, Brown Plain (Cc_bb)\n4. Absence of B (bb): Red\n   - Absence of C (cc): Plain Brown (cc_bb)\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the colors are determined by the alleles, so:\n\n- If the bird is C_, it's checkered. If it's cc, plain.\n- If the bird is B_, it's brown. If it's bb, red.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- C_ B_: Brown Checkered\n- C_ bb: Brown Plain\n- cc B_: Red Checkered\n- cc bb: Red Plain\n\nNow, the F2 generation has a 25% chance for each genotype:\n\n- C_ B_: 25%\n- C_ bb: 25%\n- cc B_: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be equally distributed among the four categories.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none directly say 1:1:1:1. The closest option is A, B, D, E, G, H, etc., which don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 generation. Let me double-check.\n\nAssuming the parents are CCBB and ccbb:\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be:\n\n- From CC \u00d7 cc: CC and cc \u2192 Cc\n- From BB \u00d7 bb: BB and bb \u2192 Bb\n\nSo F1 genotypes would be CcBB, Ccbb, CcBB, etc., but without duplication, perhaps each F1 bird is CcBB, Ccbb, CcBB, etc., but overall, the F1 would have the following:\n\nEach bird is Cc (from Cc) and BB (from BB) or Cc and bb (from cc \u00d7 BB?), wait, no\u2014it's more accurate to model it as:\n\nParent 1: CC (homozygous dominant for C) \u00d7 cc (homozygous recessive for C)\nParent 2: BB (homozygous dominant for B) \u00d7 bb (homozygous recessive for B)\n\nCrossing these, the F1 would be:\n\n- Cc (from CC \u00d7 cc)\n- BB (from BB \u00d7 bb)\n\u2192 CcBB\n- Cc (from CC \u00d7 cc)\n- bb (from cc \u00d7 BB)\n\u2192 Ccbb\n- cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n- BB (from cc \u00d7 BB)\n\u2192 ccBB (which would be plain red)\n- cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n- bb (from cc \u00d7 bb)\n\u2192 ccbb (plain brown)\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, ccbb.\n\nThen, F2 would result from crossing F1 with F1.\n\nCalculating the F2:\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes based on its genotype.\n\nFor example, CcBB bird can produce:\n\n- CC (50%)\n- Cc (25%)\n- Cc (25%)\n- BB (0%)\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two copies of each gene. For CcBB:\n\n- For C gene: 50% C, 50% c\n- For B gene: 100% B (since it's homozygous)\n\nSo the gametes for CcBB would be C (50%) and c (50%).\n\nFor ccBB bird (from cc \u00d7 BB):\n\n- For C gene: 100% c\n- For B gene: 100% B\n\u2192 Gametes: B\n\nFor ccBB bird, same as above.\n\nFor ccbb bird (from cc \u00d7 bb):\n\n- For C gene: 100% c\n- For B gene: 50% B, 50% b\n\u2192 Gametes: B (50%), b (50%)\n\nPutting it all together, the F2 generation will have various combinations:\n\nLet's compute the F2 genotypes.\n\nEach F1 bird can contribute either C, c, B, or b, depending on their genotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each F1 bird is CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, or ccbb, their gametes vary.\n\nThis is getting complex, but perhaps a better approach is to recognize that the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios based on the F1 parents.\n\nBut given that the F1 parents are CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, their F2 will have:\n\nFor the C gene: F1 is Cc, so F2 will be C (50%) and c (50%).\nFor the B gene: F1 is BB, so F2 will be B (100%).\n\nThus, the F2 for B is always B.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes for the C gene will be:\n\n- C_ : 50% (C c C c)\n- cc : 50% (c c c c)\n\nAnd since B is always B, the phenotypes are determined solely by the C gene:\n\n- C_ B_: Brown Checkered\n- cc B_: Red Checkered\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene, since F2 has B always expressed, the phenotypes are:\n\n- B_ : Brown\n- bb : Red\n\nSo combining both genes:\n\n- Brown Checkered (C_ B_): 50% of the population\n- Red Checkered (cc B_): 50% of the population\n- Brown Plain (C_ bb): 50% of the population\n- Red Plain (cc bb): 50% of the population\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are equal across the four categories.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none exactly match 1:1:1:1. The closest is option A: 6, 2, 6, 2. Option B: 8,4,0,4. Option D: 1,3,9,3. Option E: 3,9,1,3. Option J: 2,6,3,1.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recount the F2 population.\n\nIn F2, the proportion of each phenotype is:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 25% of all birds (C_ B_)\n- Brown Plain: 25% (C_ bb)\n- Red Checkered: 25% (cc B_)\n- Red Plain: 25% (cc bb)\n\nTotal: 25% + 25% = 50% for Brown, 50% for Red.\n\nWithin Brown:\n\n- 50% Checkered (C_ B_)\n- 50% Plain (cc B_)\n\nSame within Red:\n\n- 50% Checkered (cc B_)\n- 50% Plain (cc bb)\n\nSo the total counts are:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 25% of total\n- Brown Plain: 25% of total\n- Red Checkered: 25% of total\n- Red Plain: 25% of total\n\nWhich gives a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut looking at the options again, none provide 1:1:1:1. The closest is option A, which is 6,2,6,2, totaling 16, but that's incorrect because each category should add up to 16. Wait, perhaps the options are scaled differently.\n\nWait, no\u2014the options are just the numbers, not necessarily percentages. Let me see:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 12\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 18\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 16\n\nAh, so the totals per option are varying. Only options A, B, C, D, E, J, G, H sum to 16. The correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, but none of the options have that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio as count per phenotype rather than percentage. Let me recalculate the counts.\n\nIn F2, assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Brown Checkered: ",

    "chunk_removed": "Let me start by reading it carefully.",

    "chunk_resampled": "Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.",
    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nWe have two birds crossed in an A Punnett square. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means they're CC BB since it's a dominant trait. The other parent is a plain brown bird, which would be cc bb because brown is recessive and the parents are plain, meaning their genotype must be both recessive.\n\nSo the cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. First, I need to figure out the possible gametes each parent can produce. \n\nFor the first parent (CC BB), both alleles are dominant, so they'll produce gametes with both C and B. So all gametes from this parent will be CB.\n\nFor the second parent (cc bb), both alleles are recessive, so they'll produce gametes with both c and b. All these gametes will be cb.\n\nNow, when we make the Punnett square, each gamete from the first parent combines with each gamete from the second parent. So:\n\n- CB (from the first parent) combines with cb (from the second parent) \u2192 CcBb.\n- Since there's only one type of gamete from each parent, the F1 generation should just have one combination: CcBb.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because usually, when you have two different alleles on each parent, the offspring can have combinations like CC, Cc, etc., but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, maybe all the F1 are the same? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So each parent contributes one allele per locus. So the F1 would be Cc Bb. But actually, if both parents are homozygous, then F1 should all be Cc Bb. That makes sense because each parent can only contribute one allele, and since both are homozygous, the offspring will all get one copy from each parent. So the F1 is Cc Bb, which is a dihybrid individual.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Parent 1 is CC BB, so they can only give either CC or BB, but since they're homozygous, they'll always give one of the dominant alleles. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so they can only give either cc or bb, dominant or recessive respectively. So the F1 would be Cc Bb, as both parents can only give one allele each.\n\nWait, but in reality, F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would still be Cc Bb because each parent can only contribute one allele, and since both are homozygous, F1 would all be Cc Bb. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nThen, we go into the F2 generation, which comes from F1 selfing. Since F1 is Cc Bb, when they self, the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios. For a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, some phenotypes might not appear as much.\n\nLet's break down the phenotypes based on the traits given. The genes are B (dominant, red) and b (recessive, brown), and C (dominant, checkered) and c (recessive, plain). So each bird has two loci: one for color (B/b) and one for pattern (C/c).\n\nThe phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles at both loci. If the bird has at least one dominant allele at either locus, it'll display the corresponding color and pattern. So:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): if both C and c are present (so C_ and B_), and B_ (so at least one B).\n- Checkered brown (cB_): same as above but c instead of C.\n- Plain red (C__): only C present, but no B.\n- Plain brown (___): no C present, regardless of B.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"red\" and \"brown\" are controlled by B and b, and \"checkered\" by C and c. So a bird with at least one dominant allele at either locus will display the corresponding color. So:\n\n- If a bird is Cc (heterozygous for C), it'll be checkered.\n- If it's BB or Bb, it'll be red.\n- Similarly for c: cc is plain, ccB_, cB_, or ccB_B_?\n\nWait, no. Actually, the presence of a dominant allele determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele (either C or c), it'll display the corresponding pattern (checkered if C, plain if c).\n- Additionally, if it has at least one dominant allele at the other locus (B or b), it'll display the corresponding color (red if B, brown if b).\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by whether each locus has a dominant allele.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B)\n2. Checkered brown (both c and b)\n3. Plain red (only c)\n4. Plain brown (only B)\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of each phenotype appear in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 from the cross CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is Cc Bb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% CC\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 50% Cc\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 another 50% Cc\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% cc\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 25% BB\n- BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 50% Bb\n- bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotype distribution is 9/16 CC BB, 3/16 CC Bb, 3/16 CC bb, 3/16 cc BB, 3/16 cc Bb, 1/16 cc bb.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nBut wait, actually, when F1 (Cc Bb) selfs, the segregation is independent for each gene. So the number of each genotype is:\n\nFor C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied. So for example, CC BB is (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, CC Bb is 6.25%, CC bb is 6.25%, cc BB is 6.25%, cc Bb is 6.25%, and cc bb is 6.25%. Wait, but that adds up to 37.5% total, but since each parent is 100%, the sum is 100%, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to consider each gene separately and then combine them using multiplication. For example, for the C gene:\n\nProbability of CC: 25% (since CC \u00d7 CC gives 25% CC, CC \u00d7 cc gives 50% Cc, and cc \u00d7 cc gives 25% cc)\n\nWait, no. When F1 (Cc) selfs, the probability is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B gene:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 will have each genotype with the product of the probabilities for each gene. So for example:\n\n- CC BB: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 6.25%\n- CC bb: 6.25%\n- cc BB: 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 6.25%\n- cc bb: 6.25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 37.5%, which isn't 100%. I must be missing something.\n\nAh, no, actually, the F1 is Cc Bb, so when it selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBecause each parent produces gametes with equal frequency for each allele, and the combination is independent.\n\nSo each genotype occurs at 25% probability.\n\nNow, we need to map these genotypes to phenotypes based on the dominance rules.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- For the C locus:\n  - CC: checkered (C present)\n  - Cc: checkered (C present)\n  - cc: plain (no C)\n\n- For the B locus:\n  - BB: red (B present)\n  - Bb: red (B present)\n  - bb: brown (no B)\n\nBut the phenotype is determined by having any dominant allele at either locus. So:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele exists at either locus, the bird displays the corresponding color and pattern.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C present AND B present)\n2. Checkered brown (c present AND B present)\n3. Plain red (c present AND B absent)\n4. Plain brown (C present AND B absent)\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nFirst, let's find how many have both C and B (Checkered red):\n\nThese are the cases where C is present (any C) and B is present (any B). From the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Yes\n- CC Bb: Yes\n- CC bb: No (because c present, but B is not present)\nWait, no, CC bb: C present (C), but b present (B? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the B locus is for brown or red. So in CC bb, B is present only if B is present, but in bb, B is absent. So CC bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSimilarly, cc BB: C absent, B present \u2192 Red\n\ncc Bb: C absent, B present \u2192 Red\n\ncc bb: Both C and B absent \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, but no, wait. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- Any dominant allele at C \u2192 Checkered\n- Any dominant allele at B \u2192 Red\n\nIf both are present \u2192 Checkered red.\n\nIf only C is present \u2192 Checkered.\n\nOnly B \u2192 Red.\n\nNeither \u2192 Brown.\n\nSo now, let's categorize each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: C and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc BB: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n5. cc Bb: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n6. cc bb: c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but according to this, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (cases 1 and 2)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (case 3)\n- Plain red: 2 (cases 4 and 5)\n- Plain brown: 1 (case 6)\n\nBut that totals 6, which doesn't add up correctly because F2 should have 16 individuals.\n\nWait, no, because each genotype is 25%, so the counts are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4\n- CC Bb: 1/4\n- CC bb: 1/4\n- cc BB: 1/4\n- cc Bb: 1/4\n- cc bb: 1/4\n\nEach of these corresponds to the phenotypes as follows:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nSo now, counting how many of each:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (since 2/4 of the population)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (1/4)\n- Plain red: 2 (2/4)\n- Plain brown: 1 (1/4)\n\nWait, but that sums to 6, which is less than 16. That suggests a miscalculation. I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, no. Each of the six F2 genotypes represents 25% of the population. So in terms of numbers, each has 25% chance, so the actual number in each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% + 25% = 50% of the population (Cases 1 and 2)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Case 3)\n- Plain red: 25% + 25% = 50% (Cases 4 and 5)\n- Plain brown: 25% (Case 6)\n\nBut that also doesn't add up because 50% + 25% + 50% + 25% equals 100%. However, the actual counts would depend on the number of offspring produced. But the question asks about the phenotypic ratio, not the actual count percentages.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (cases 1 and 2)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (case 3)\n- Plain red: 50% (cases 4 and 5)\n- Plain brown: 25% (case 6)\n\nWhich translates to 50:25:50:25, but looking back at the options provided, none of them exactly match this. Let's look through the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Ratios 3:9:1:3 (which is 75% Checkered red, 25% Checkered brown, 12.5% Plain red, 3.75% Plain brown)\nOption G: 12,2,2,1 \u2192 12:2:2:1 (150% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, 12.5% Plain brown)\nOption D: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1 (20% Checkered red, 60% Checkered brown, 15% Plain red, 5% Plain brown)\n\nHmm, my calculation gave 50:25:50:25, which is 1:0.5:1:0.25 in decimal terms, but none of the options match this exact ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the dominance rules. The presence of a dominant allele at either locus leads to the corresponding color and pattern. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele at the C locus and at least one at the B locus, it's Checkered red.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele at C and not B, it's Checkered brown.\n- If it has not C but has B, it's Plain red.\n- If neither C nor B, it's Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: C and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc BB: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n5. cc Bb: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n6. cc bb: c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 1\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nTotal: 6, which is incorrect because F2 should have 16 individuals. So each of these 6 is 25% of the population, so in terms of counts, it's 16 divided into 16 parts, each part representing a bird. So 4 birds would be represented by each of these 6 categories.\n\nWait, no, the F2 is 16 birds, each 25% (so 4 each). So each of the 6 categories would have 4 birds each, totaling 24, which is less than 16. This suggests that perhaps I misapplied the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way to calculate phenotypes is to see if the bird is heterozygous at either locus. Because in the absence of dominance, a bird may exhibit the phenotype of the homozygote.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the alleles are codominant, but perhaps in this context, it's simpler to assume that the presence of a dominant allele at any locus results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nIn that case, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: All birds with at least one dominant allele at either locus.

Let's define dominance as:\n\n- B is dominant over b\n- C is dominant over c\n\nSo, for each bird, if it has at least one dominant allele at either locus, it will display the corresponding color and pattern.\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on whether each locus has a dominant allele. Therefore:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C), and/or B is present (at least one B), the bird is Checkered red.\n- If C is present but not B, it's Checkered brown.\n- If not C but B is present, it's Plain red.\n- If neither C nor B is present, it's Plain brown.\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 genotypes:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nWe have two birds crossed in an A Punnett square. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means they're CC BB since it's a dominant trait. The other parent is a plain brown bird, which would be cc bb because brown is recessive and the parents are plain, meaning their genotype must be both recessive.\n\nSo the cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. First, I need to figure out the possible gametes each parent can produce. \n\nFor the first parent (CC BB), both alleles are dominant, so they'll produce gametes with both C and B. So all gametes from this parent will be CB.\n\nFor the second parent (cc bb), both alleles are recessive, so they'll produce gametes with both c and b. All these gametes will be cb.\n\nNow, when we make the Punnett square, each gamete from the first parent combines with each gamete from the second parent. So:\n\n- CB (from the first parent) combines with cb (from the second parent) \u2192 CcBb.\n- Since there's only one type of gamete from each parent, the F1 generation should just have one combination: CcBb.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because usually, when you have two different alleles on each parent, the offspring can have combinations like CC, Cc, etc., but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, maybe all the F1 are the same? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So each parent contributes one allele per locus. So the F1 would be Cc Bb. But actually, if both parents are homozygous, then F1 should all be Cc Bb. That makes sense because each parent can only contribute one allele, and since both are homozygous, the offspring will all get one copy from each parent. So the F1 is Cc Bb, which is a dihybrid individual.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Parent 1 is CC BB, so they can only give either CC or BB, but since they're homozygous, they'll always give one of the dominant alleles. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so they can only give either cc or bb, dominant or recessive respectively. So the F1 would be Cc Bb, as both parents can only give one allele each.\n\nWait, but in reality, F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb would still be Cc Bb because each parent can only contribute one allele, and since both are homozygous, F1 would all be Cc Bb. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nThen, we go into the F2 generation, which comes from F1 selfing. Since F1 is Cc Bb, when they self, the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios. For a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, some phenotypes might not appear as much.\n\nLet's break down the phenotypes based on the traits given. The genes are B (dominant, red) and b (recessive, brown), and C (dominant, checkered) and c (recessive, plain). So each bird has two loci: one for color (B/b) and one for pattern (C/c).\n\nThe phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles at both loci. If the bird has at least one dominant allele at either locus, it'll display the corresponding color and pattern. So:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): if both C and c are present (so C_ and B_), and B_ (so at least one B).\n- Checkered brown (cB_): same as above but c instead of C.\n- Plain red (C__): only C present, but no B.\n- Plain brown (___): no C present, regardless of B.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"red\" and \"brown\" are controlled by B and b, and \"checkered\" by C and c. So a bird with at least one dominant allele at either locus will display the corresponding color. So:\n\n- If a bird is Cc (heterozygous for C), it'll be checkered.\n- If it's BB or Bb, it'll be red.\n- Similarly for c: cc is plain, ccB_, cB_, or ccB_B_?\n\nWait, no. Actually, the presence of a dominant allele determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele (either C or c), it'll display the corresponding pattern (checkered if C, plain if c).\n- Additionally, if it has at least one dominant allele at the other locus (B or b), it'll display the corresponding color (red if B, brown if b).\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by whether each locus has a dominant allele.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B)\n2. Checkered brown (both c and b)\n3. Plain red (only c)\n4. Plain brown (only B)\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of each phenotype appear in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F1 from the cross CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is Cc Bb. When F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% CC\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 50% Cc\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 another 50% Cc\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% cc\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 25% BB\n- BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 50% Bb\n- bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotype distribution is 9/16 CC BB, 3/16 CC Bb, 3/16 CC bb, 3/16 cc BB, 3/16 cc Bb, 1/16 cc bb.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nBut wait, actually, when F1 (Cc Bb) selfs, the segregation is independent for each gene. So the number of each genotype is:\n\nFor C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSame for B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied. So for example, CC BB is (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, CC Bb is 6.25%, CC bb is 6.25%, cc BB is 6.25%, cc Bb is 6.25%, and cc bb is 6.25%. Wait, but that adds up to 37.5% total, but since each parent is 100%, the sum is 100%, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to consider each gene separately and then combine them using multiplication. For example, for the C gene:\n\nProbability of CC: 25% (since CC \u00d7 CC gives 25% CC, CC \u00d7 cc gives 50% Cc, and cc \u00d7 cc gives 25% cc)\n\nWait, no. When F1 (Cc) selfs, the probability is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B gene:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 will have each genotype with the product of the probabilities for each gene. So for example:\n\n- CC BB: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 6.25%\n- CC bb: 6.25%\n- cc BB: 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 6.25%\n- cc bb: 6.25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 37.5%, which isn't 100%. I must be missing something.\n\nAh, no, actually, the F1 is Cc Bb, so when it selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBecause each parent produces gametes with equal frequency for each allele, and the combination is independent.\n\nSo each genotype occurs at 25% probability.\n\nNow, we need to map these genotypes to phenotypes based on the dominance rules.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- For the C locus:\n  - CC: checkered (C present)\n  - Cc: checkered (C present)\n  - cc: plain (no C)\n\n- For the B locus:\n  - BB: red (B present)\n  - Bb: red (B present)\n  - bb: brown (no B)\n\nBut the phenotype is determined by having any dominant allele at either locus. So:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele exists at either locus, the bird displays the corresponding color and pattern.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C present AND B present)\n2. Checkered brown (c present AND B present)\n3. Plain red (c present AND B absent)\n4. Plain brown (C present AND B absent)\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nFirst, let's find how many have both C and B (Checkered red):\n\nThese are the cases where C is present (any C) and B is present (any B). From the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Yes\n- CC Bb: Yes\n- CC bb: No (because c present, but B is not present)\nWait, no, CC bb: C present (C), but b present (B? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the B locus is for brown or red. So in CC bb, B is present only if B is present, but in bb, B is absent. So CC bb: C present, B absent \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSimilarly, cc BB: C absent, B present \u2192 Red\n\ncc Bb: C absent, B present \u2192 Red\n\ncc bb: Both C and B absent \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, but no, wait. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- Any dominant allele at C \u2192 Checkered\n- Any dominant allele at B \u2192 Red\n\nIf both are present \u2192 Checkered red.\n\nIf only C is present \u2192 Checkered.\n\nOnly B \u2192 Red.\n\nNeither \u2192 Brown.\n\nSo now, let's categorize each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: C and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc BB: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n5. cc Bb: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n6. cc bb: c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but according to this, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (cases 1 and 2)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (case 3)\n- Plain red: 2 (cases 4 and 5)\n- Plain brown: 1 (case 6)\n\nBut that totals 6, which doesn't add up correctly because F2 should have 16 individuals.\n\nWait, no, because each genotype is 25%, so the counts are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4\n- CC Bb: 1/4\n- CC bb: 1/4\n- cc BB: 1/4\n- cc Bb: 1/4\n- cc bb: 1/4\n\nEach of these corresponds to the phenotypes as follows:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nSo now, counting how many of each:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (since 2/4 of the population)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (1/4)\n- Plain red: 2 (2/4)\n- Plain brown: 1 (1/4)\n\nWait, but that sums to 6, which is less than 16. That suggests a miscalculation. I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, no. Each of the six F2 genotypes represents 25% of the population. So in terms of numbers, each has 25% chance, so the actual number in each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% + 25% = 50% of the population (Cases 1 and 2)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Case 3)\n- Plain red: 25% + 25% = 50% (Cases 4 and 5)\n- Plain brown: 25% (Case 6)\n\nBut that also doesn't add up because 50% + 25% + 50% + 25% equals 100%. However, the actual counts would depend on the number of offspring produced. But the question asks about the phenotypic ratio, not the actual count percentages.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (cases 1 and 2)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (case 3)\n- Plain red: 50% (cases 4 and 5)\n- Plain brown: 25% (case 6)\n\nWhich translates to 50:25:50:25, but looking back at the options provided, none of them exactly match this. Let's look through the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Ratios 3:9:1:3 (which is 75% Checkered red, 25% Checkered brown, 12.5% Plain red, 3.75% Plain brown)\nOption G: 12,2,2,1 \u2192 12:2:2:1 (150% Checkered red, 50% Checkered brown, 25% Plain red, 12.5% Plain brown)\nOption D: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1 (20% Checkered red, 60% Checkered brown, 15% Plain red, 5% Plain brown)\n\nHmm, my calculation gave 50:25:50:25, which is 1:0.5:1:0.25 in decimal terms, but none of the options match this exact ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the dominance rules. The presence of a dominant allele at either locus leads to the corresponding color and pattern. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele at the C locus and at least one at the B locus, it's Checkered red.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele at C and not B, it's Checkered brown.\n- If it has not C but has B, it's Plain red.\n- If neither C nor B, it's Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: C and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc BB: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n5. cc Bb: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n6. cc bb: c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 1\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nTotal: 6, which is incorrect because F2 should have 16 individuals. So each of these 6 is 25% of the population, so in terms of counts, it's 16 divided into 16 parts, each part representing a bird. So 4 birds would be represented by each of these 6 categories.\n\nWait, no, the F2 is 16 birds, each 25% (so 4 each). So each of the 6 categories would have 4 birds each, totaling 24, which is less than 16. This suggests that perhaps I misapplied the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way to calculate phenotypes is to see if the bird is heterozygous at either locus. Because in the absence of dominance, a bird may exhibit the phenotype of the homozygote.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the alleles are codominant, but perhaps in this context, it's simpler to assume that the presence of a dominant allele at any locus results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nIn that case, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: All birds with at least one dominant allele at either locus. Which includes:\n\n  - Heterozygotes at C or B: CC Bb, CC BB, cc Bb, cc BB\n  - Homozygous dominant at either C or B: CC BB, cc BB, CC Bb, cc Bb (wait, no, CC BB is dominant at both, so it's Checkered red)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of dominance hierarchy. Let's define dominance as:\n\n- B is dominant over b\n- C is dominant over c\n\nSo, for each bird, if it has at least one dominant allele at either locus, it will display the corresponding color and pattern.\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on whether each locus has a dominant allele. Therefore:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C), and/or B is present (at least one B), the bird is Checkered red.\n- If C is present but not B, it's Checkered brown.\n- If not C but B is present, it's Plain red.\n- If neither C nor B is present, it's Plain brown.\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb: C and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc BB: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n5. cc Bb: c and B \u2192 Plain red\n6. cc bb: c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red:",

    "rollout": " It's about a punnet square for an adihybrid cross between two birds. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nThe first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird. That means it has the genotype CC and BB because both its checkered and red traits are dominant. So its phenotype is checkered red.\n\nThe second bird is a plain brown bird. Its genotype must be cc and bb since both are recessive alleles. So its phenotype is plain brown.\n\nNow, we're looking at an adihybrid cross between these two birds. Adihybrid crosses involve two different genes being crossed simultaneously. In this case, the two birds have separate genes: one affecting checkered vs. plain (C and c), and another affecting red vs. brown (B and b).\n\nTo construct the Punnett square, we'll consider all possible combinations of gametes from each parent.\n\nFor the first parent (checkered red, CC BB), the possible gametes are CB and cb. Wait, no\u2014the bird is homozygous, so it can only produce one type of gamete. Since both C and B are dominant, the gametes should just carry those. So actually, the first parent can only produce gametes CB or cb? Or wait, in bird genetics, the notation might differ. Maybe it's more like the parents contribute either the dominant or recessive allele for each trait. But if it's homozygous, they can't carry both alleles. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. If the bird is homozygous for both traits, then all its gametes will carry the dominant allele for each trait. So for C (dominant checkered), it's always C, and for B (dominant red), it's always B. Therefore, the only gamete possible is CB.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is plain brown, which is cc bb. So both alleles are recessive. Thus, their gametes will be cb.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if you're producing gametes, each gamete carries one allele. So for the first parent (CC BB), the gametes would carry either C or B\u2014wait, but since it's homozygous, it must carry both. So actually, the first parent can only produce gametes CB. Similarly, the second parent (cc bb) can only produce gametes cb.\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like:\n\nFirst parent (CB): produces CB.\nSecond parent (cb): produces cb.\n\nCrossing them together: CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nWait, but the options given include other possibilities like CcBb, but none of the answers directly mention that. Let me see what the user provided.\n\nLooking back, the initial prompt had some gamete lists, but now the user presented a detailed list of possible gametes for the F1 cross. However, I think the correct approach is to recognize that both parents can only produce one type of gamete due to their dominance and homozygosity.\n\nTherefore, the F1 bird should be CcBb.\n\nNow, the next part is to determine the phenotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the cross is between two CcBb birds.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (homozygous dominant) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n- Probability of cc (heterozygous recessive) = 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2\n- Probability of Cc (heterozygote) = same as cc, 1/2\n\nSame logic applies to the B locus.\n\nNow, combining these:\n\nPhenotype depends on both loci. Checkered (C) and red (B) are dominant, while plain (c) and brown (b) are recessive.\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain red (ccB_)\n4. Plain brown (ccc)\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. Since C affects checkered vs. plain and B affects red vs. brown, the combination of these traits would result in specific phenotypes.\n\nSo, for each F2 individual, we can calculate how many would express each phenotype based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nLet me compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(C) = 3/4 (since 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4)\n- P(cc) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- P(B) = 3/4\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nNow, let's find the probability for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_):\n   - P(C) * P(B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb):\n   - P(C) * P(b) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain red (ccB_):\n   - P(cc) * P(B) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (ccc):\n   - P(cc) * P(b) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0 when divided by 2.\n\nThat doesn't match our calculation. Option H has checkered red 5, brown 3, etc., which also doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sums to 16, but according to our calculation, it's 9+3+3+1=16 parts, so 9:3:3:1.\n\nNone of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me confirm:\n\nCheckered (C) is dominant over plain (c). Red (B) is dominant over brown (b). So:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_\n- Checkered brown: C_bb\n- Plain red: ccB_\n- Plain brown: ccb\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the options, option J is 2,6,3,1 which sums to 12. No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was incorrect. Maybe the parents don't produce gametes as I thought.\n\nWait, going back: the first parent is CC BB, homozygous. So it must produce gametes CB. The second is cc bb, which must produce gametes cb.\n\nThus, F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F2 is CcBb x CcBb.\n\nCalculating the phenotypes correctly, we get 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to present a different scenario where both parents can produce multiple types of gametes, leading to recombinant types, but I think that's beyond standard adihybrid crosses.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the options are provided, I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the initial setup. The first bird is CC BB, homozygous, meaning all gametes are CB. Second is cc bb, all gametes are cb. So F1 is CcBb.\n\nNow, F2 is CcBb x CcBb.\n\nEach gene is segregating independently:\n\nFor C:\n- Possible gametes: C (prob 3/4), cc (1/4)\n\nFor B:\n- Possible gametes: B (3/4), bb (1/4)\n\nCombined, each trait is independent.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's about a punnet square for an adihybrid cross between two birds. Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nThe first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird. That means it has the genotype CC and BB because both its checkered and red traits are dominant. So its phenotype is checkered red.\n\nThe second bird is a plain brown bird. Its genotype must be cc and bb since both are recessive alleles. So its phenotype is plain brown.\n\nNow, we're looking at an adihybrid cross between these two birds. Adihybrid crosses involve two different genes being crossed simultaneously. In this case, the two birds have separate genes: one affecting checkered vs. plain (C and c), and another affecting red vs. brown (B and b).\n\nTo construct the Punnett square, we'll consider all possible combinations of gametes from each parent.\n\nFor the first parent (checkered red, CC BB), the possible gametes are CB and cb. Wait, no\u2014the bird is homozygous, so it can only produce one type of gamete. Since both C and B are dominant, the gametes should just carry those. So actually, the first parent can only produce gametes CB or cb? Or wait, in bird genetics, the notation might differ. Maybe it's more like the parents contribute either the dominant or recessive allele for each trait. But if it's homozygous, they can't carry both alleles. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. If the bird is homozygous for both traits, then all its gametes will carry the dominant allele for each trait. So for C (dominant checkered), it's always C, and for B (dominant red), it's always B. Therefore, the only gamete possible is CB.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is plain brown, which is cc bb. So both alleles are recessive. Thus, their gametes will be cb.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if you're producing gametes, each gamete carries one allele. So for the first parent (CC BB), the gametes would carry either C or B\u2014wait, but since it's homozygous, it must carry both. So actually, the first parent can only produce gametes CB. Similarly, the second parent (cc bb) can only produce gametes cb.\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like:\n\nFirst parent (CB): produces CB.\nSecond parent (cb): produces cb.\n\nCrossing them together: CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nWait, but the options given include other possibilities like CcBb, but none of the answers directly mention that. Let me see what the user provided.\n\nLooking back, the initial prompt had some gamete lists, but now the user presented a detailed list of possible gametes for the F1 cross. However, I think the correct approach is to recognize that both parents can only produce one type of gamete due to their dominance and homozygosity.\n\nTherefore, the F1 bird should be CcBb.\n\nNow, the next part is to determine the phenotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the cross is between two CcBb birds.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (homozygous dominant) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n- Probability of cc (heterozygous recessive) = 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2\n- Probability of Cc (heterozygote) = same as cc, 1/2\n\nSame logic applies to the B locus.\n\nNow, combining these:\n\nPhenotype depends on both loci. Checkered (C) and red (B) are dominant, while plain (c) and brown (b) are recessive.\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain red (ccB_)\n4. Plain brown (ccc)\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. Since C affects checkered vs. plain and B affects red vs. brown, the combination of these traits would result in specific phenotypes.\n\nSo, for each F2 individual, we can calculate how many would express each phenotype based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nLet me compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- P(C) = 3/4 (since 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4)\n- P(cc) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- P(B) = 3/4\n- P(b) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nNow, let's find the probability for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_):\n   - P(C) * P(B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb):\n   - P(C) * P(b) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain red (ccB_):\n   - P(cc) * P(B) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (ccc):\n   - P(cc) * P(b) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0 when divided by 2.\n\nThat doesn't match our calculation. Option H has checkered red 5, brown 3, etc., which also doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sums to 16, but according to our calculation, it's 9+3+3+1=16 parts, so 9:3:3:1.\n\nNone of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me confirm:\n\nCheckered (C) is dominant over plain (c). Red (B) is dominant over brown (b). So:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_\n- Checkered brown: C_bb\n- Plain red: ccB_\n- Plain brown: ccb\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the options, option J is 2,6,3,1 which sums to 12. No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was incorrect. Maybe the parents don't produce gametes as I thought.\n\nWait, going back: the first parent is CC BB, homozygous. So it must produce gametes CB. The second is cc bb, which must produce gametes cb.\n\nThus, F1 is CcBb.\n\nThen, F2 is CcBb x CcBb.\n\nCalculating the phenotypes correctly, we get 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to present a different scenario where both parents can produce multiple types of gametes, leading to recombinant types, but I think that's beyond standard adihybrid crosses.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the options are provided, I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the initial setup. The first bird is CC BB, homozygous, meaning all gametes are CB. Second is cc bb, all gametes are cb. So F1 is CcBb.\n\nNow, F2 is CcBb x CcBb.\n\nEach gene is segregating independently:\n\nFor C:\n- Possible gametes: C (prob 3/4), cc (1/4)\n\nFor B:\n- Possible gametes: B (3/4), bb (1/4)\n\nCombined, each trait is independent.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ (checkered red)\n2. C_bb (checkered brown)\n3. ccB_ (plain red)\n4. ccb (plain brown)\n\nTheir probabilities:\n\n1. C_B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C_bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. ccB_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. ccb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 16/16.\n\nNow, comparing to the options:\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 12 parts total, but our calculation shows 16 parts, so scaled down by a factor of 1/16, giving 9:3:3:1.\n\nNo option matches exactly, but option D is 1,3,9,3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers only one allele per gene, making the Punnett square different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and just count phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nBut that wouldn't align with the usual approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that each gene is acting independently, and the phenotypic ratios are calculated accordingly.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options provided.

Summing to 16, which fits our 9:3:3:1 but scaled differently.\n\nIf we multiply by 2, 18:6:6:0, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's an error in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but that gives checkered brown 9, plain red 1, which doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J: 2,6,3,1, summing to 12, but that's half of what I calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated.

    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves two birds that are crossed, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio in their offspring. The birds have specific genes involved here. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two parents:\n1. Parent 1: CCBB (checkered red)\n2. Parent 2: ccbb (plain brown)\n\nWe're looking at an APHYLOGENETIC cross between these two birds. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"adihybridcross,\" but then it mentions a homozgygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Hmm, maybe I got confused. No, wait\u2014APHLOGENETIC crosses usually involve three alleles, like AaBbCc, but here we have two birds with two pairs each. So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross? But let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the question specifies that it's an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. AdiHybrid crosses typically involve two different alleles from each parent, making it trihybrid or something else. Wait, no\u2014it might be a dihybrid cross because each parent has two traits.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC (homozygous dominant for color) BB (homozygous dominant for another trait). Wait, no\u2014the two genes are C and c for one trait, and B and b for another. So each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nSo Parent 1: CC (for color) BB (for another trait), so genotype CCBB.\nParent 2: cc (recessive for color) bb (recessive for the other trait), so genotype ccbb.\n\nNow, when they mate, the offspring will get one allele for each gene from each parent. So for the first gene (color), Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c. For the second gene (another trait), Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b.\n\nSo the F1 generation would be Cc for the color gene and Bb for the other trait. Wait, but the question asks about an F2 generation after selfing. Oh, right, so the cross is between F1 and F1 again, which makes the F2.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The question starts with P: CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which is the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross. Then it goes on to talk about gametes and F1 and F2 generations. Maybe the initial part is just explaining how to set up the cross, and the main focus is on the F2 generation.\n\nBut the actual question is asking about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, not the F1. Because the F1 themselves are all CcBb, and when you cross them with each other, you get F2.\n\nSo the F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Now, the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two genes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The dominant alleles (C and B) result in checkered red, while the recessive (c and b) give plain brown. So the phenotypes can be four types: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nTo find the ratio, I'll use a Punnett square for the F2 cross. Each gene is independent, so I can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the color gene (C/c):\n- Probability of C = 50% (since Cc is the heterozygote)\n- Probability of c = 50%\n\nFor the other trait (B/b):\n- Probability of B = 50%\n- Probability of b = 50%\n\nSince both genes are independent, the probability for any combination is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nNow, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (color) + B (other trait) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C (color) + b (other trait) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. c (color) + B (other trait) \u2192 Plain red\n4. c (color) + b (other trait) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNext, I need to calculate how many of each combination occur in the F2 generation.\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance, so for each gene, the number of each genotype is 25%, 50%, 25%. But since we're combining two independent genes, each outcome is 25%.\n\nHowever, the total number of offspring will be 16, as each parent produces 4 gametes, so 4x4=16.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square approach:\n\n|          | CB | cb |\n|----------|---|---|\n| CC       | CC | CC |\n| Cc       | Cc | Cc |\n\nBut wait, the correct way is:\n\nEach parent's gamete possibilities are CB and cb. So the Punnett square should be:\n\n        CB    cb\n   CB  CC BB  Cc BB\n   cb  Cc Bb  cc bb\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each parent is CcBb, so each gamete is C/B or c/b.\n\nSo the F1 cross is CcBb x CcBb, leading to F2.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would look like this:\n\n```\n        CB     cb\n      _____________\n      |CC|   Cc   |\nCB    |CC|   Cc   |\n      _____________\n      |Cc|   Cc   |\ncb    |Cc|   Cc   |\n      _____________\n      |cc|   cb   |\ncb    |cc|   cb   |\n      _____________\n```\n\nSo the resulting genotypes are:\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, let's count the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB): 3 cases\n2. Checkered Brown (CC bb, Cc Bb): 2 cases\n3. Plain Red (Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB): 3 cases\n4. Plain Brown (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb): 1 case\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+2+3+1=9, which seems off because the total should be 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the Punnett square:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (1)\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown (1)\n- Cc BB: Checkered Red (1)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown (1)\n- Cc bb: Plain Red (1)\n- cc BB: Plain Red (1)\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown (1)\n- cc bb: Plain Red (1)\n\nSo checking each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3\n- Plain Brown: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So the counts are 3, 2, 3, 1 for each phenotype respectively.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 3:2:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's not matching.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6. No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3. No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1. No.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. No.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2.\n\nWait, none of the options match exactly. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (1/16)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (1/16)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (1/16)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (1/16)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (1/16)\n6.

The initial problem states:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.

Plain Brown (case 8) \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9, which matches 16 - 7 = 9 non-red birds.\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:3:1 for Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to match this exact ratio.

Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question considers all possible phenotypes, including those with both traits present, but in reality, they don't.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the dominance differently. In dihybrid crosses with dominance, the phenotypic ratios change.\n\nThe formula for the phenotypic ratio when both traits are dominant is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, it depends on which alleles are dominant.\n\nHere, C is dominant for color, and B is dominant for another trait.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves two birds that are crossed, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio in their offspring. The birds have specific genes involved here. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two parents:\n1. Parent 1: CCBB (checkered red)\n2. Parent 2: ccbb (plain brown)\n\nWe're looking at an APHYLOGENETIC cross between these two birds. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"adihybridcross,\" but then it mentions a homozgygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Hmm, maybe I got confused. No, wait\u2014APHLOGENETIC crosses usually involve three alleles, like AaBbCc, but here we have two birds with two pairs each. So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross? But let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the question specifies that it's an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. AdiHybrid crosses typically involve two different alleles from each parent, making it trihybrid or something else. Wait, no\u2014it might be a dihybrid cross because each parent has two traits.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CC (homozygous dominant for color) BB (homozygous dominant for another trait). Wait, no\u2014the two genes are C and c for one trait, and B and b for another. So each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nSo Parent 1: CC (for color) BB (for another trait), so genotype CCBB.\nParent 2: cc (recessive for color) bb (recessive for the other trait), so genotype ccbb.\n\nNow, when they mate, the offspring will get one allele for each gene from each parent. So for the first gene (color), Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c. For the second gene (another trait), Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b.\n\nSo the F1 generation would be Cc for the color gene and Bb for the other trait. Wait, but the question asks about an F2 generation after selfing. Oh, right, so the cross is between F1 and F1 again, which makes the F2.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The question starts with P: CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which is the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross. Then it goes on to talk about gametes and F1 and F2 generations. Maybe the initial part is just explaining how to set up the cross, and the main focus is on the F2 generation.\n\nBut the actual question is asking about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, not the F1. Because the F1 themselves are all CcBb, and when you cross them with each other, you get F2.\n\nSo the F2 generation comes from crossing F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Now, the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two genes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The dominant alleles (C and B) result in checkered red, while the recessive (c and b) give plain brown. So the phenotypes can be four types: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nTo find the ratio, I'll use a Punnett square for the F2 cross. Each gene is independent, so I can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the color gene (C/c):\n- Probability of C = 50% (since Cc is the heterozygote)\n- Probability of c = 50%\n\nFor the other trait (B/b):\n- Probability of B = 50%\n- Probability of b = 50%\n\nSince both genes are independent, the probability for any combination is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nNow, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (color) + B (other trait) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C (color) + b (other trait) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. c (color) + B (other trait) \u2192 Plain red\n4. c (color) + b (other trait) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNext, I need to calculate how many of each combination occur in the F2 generation.\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance, so for each gene, the number of each genotype is 25%, 50%, 25%. But since we're combining two independent genes, each outcome is 25%.\n\nHowever, the total number of offspring will be 16, as each parent produces 4 gametes, so 4x4=16.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square approach:\n\n|          | CB | cb |\n|----------|---|---|\n| CC       | CC | CC |\n| Cc       | Cc | Cc |\n\nBut wait, the correct way is:\n\nEach parent's gamete possibilities are CB and cb. So the Punnett square should be:\n\n        CB    cb\n   CB  CC BB  Cc BB\n   cb  Cc Bb  cc bb\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each parent is CcBb, so each gamete is C/B or c/b.\n\nSo the F1 cross is CcBb x CcBb, leading to F2.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would look like this:\n\n```\n        CB     cb\n      _____________\n      |CC|   Cc   |\nCB    |CC|   Cc   |\n      _____________\n      |Cc|   Cc   |\ncb    |Cc|   Cc   |\n      _____________\n      |cc|   cb   |\ncb    |cc|   cb   |\n      _____________\n```\n\nSo the resulting genotypes are:\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, let's count the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB): 3 cases\n2. Checkered Brown (CC bb, Cc Bb): 2 cases\n3. Plain Red (Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB): 3 cases\n4. Plain Brown (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb): 1 case\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+2+3+1=9, which seems off because the total should be 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the Punnett square:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (1)\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown (1)\n- Cc BB: Checkered Red (1)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown (1)\n- Cc bb: Plain Red (1)\n- cc BB: Plain Red (1)\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown (1)\n- cc bb: Plain Red (1)\n\nSo checking each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3\n- Plain Brown: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So the counts are 3, 2, 3, 1 for each phenotype respectively.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 3:2:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's not matching.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6. No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3. No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1. No.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. No.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2.\n\nWait, none of the options match exactly. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (1/16)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (1/16)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (1/16)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (1/16)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (1/16)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (1/16)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (1/16)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (1/16)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (1/16)\n\nAdding up the checks:\n\nCheckered Red: Cases 1,4,5 \u2192 3/16\n\nCheckered Brown: Cases 2,6 \u2192 2/16\n\nPlain Red: Cases 3,7,9 \u2192 3/16\n\nPlain Brown: Case 8 \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:3:1 for the phenotypes.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the given options match my calculation.

Similarly, B is dominant for another trait, so any presence of B means the other trait is present, else plain.\n\nRed color is C (dominant), brown is c (recessive).\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered Red\n- If C is present, B is absent \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C is absent, B is present \u2192 Plain Red\n- If neither C nor B are present \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo in the F2, the counts per phenotype are:\n\nCheckered Red: 3 (from CC BB, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n\nCheckered Brown: 2 (CC Bb, Cc Bb)\n\nPlain Red: 3 (Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB)\n\nPlain Brown: 1 (cc bb)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match.

Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, reviewing the options again:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the answer to be option E, but I'm getting a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, in the F2, the number of Checkered Red is 3 (from CC BB, Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 3/16.\n\nCheckered Brown: 2 (CC Bb, Cc Bb) \u2192 2/16.\n\nPlain Red: 3 (CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB) \u2192 3/16.\n\nPlain Brown: 1 (cc bb) \u2192 1/16.\n\nSo the ratio is 3:2:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none have this. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question considers all possible phenotypes, including those with both traits present, but in reality, they don't.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the dominance differently. In dihybrid crosses with dominance, the phenotypic ratios change.\n\nThe formula for the phenotypic ratio when both traits are dominant is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, it depends on which alleles are dominant.\n\nHere, C is dominant for color, and B is dominant for another trait. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThe correct way is to calculate the percentage of each phenotype.\n\nCompute the probabilities:\n\nFor each bird, the chance of showing Checkered Red (both C and B present):\n\nProbability = (prob C) * (prob B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nCheckered Brown: (prob C) * (prob not B) + (prob not C) * (prob B) \u2192 0.5*0",

    "rollout": " Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two birds being crossed: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). I need to find the phenotypic ratio of their offspring, specifically in the F2 generation. There are several parts to this: identifying the possible gametes, creating a Punnett square, determining the genotypes and phenotypes, calculating the frequencies, and then comparing them to the given options.\n\nStarting with the alleles involved:\n\nFor the first parent (checkered red): CCBB means they have two dominant alleles for both genes. So, CC (for the checkered part) and BB (for red color).\n\nThe second parent (plain brown): ccbb has two recessive alleles for each gene. 'c' is for plain, and 'b' is for brown.\n\nSo, when these two parents mate, the F1 generation will be the result of crossing CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, actually, no\u2014the question says to consider an F1\u00d7F1 cross because the F2 comes from that. But let me focus on the initial F1\u00d7F1 cross.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the actual cross first. The problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So, the parents are CCBB and ccbb.\n\nWhen you cross CCBB (homozygous dominant) with ccbb (homozygous recessive), all the offspring will be CcBb. Because each parent contributes either C or c for the first gene and B or b for the second gene. Since CCBB is homozygous dominant, all its gametes will carry the dominant alleles. Similarly, ccbb is homozygous recessive, so all its gametes will carry the recessive alleles.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation from this cross will all be CcBb. Now, since we're looking at the F2 generation, which comes from F1\u00d7F1, but wait\u2014no, the F2 is actually from F1\u00d7F1 where F1 is CcBb. So each F1 bird can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb again. That gives us four possible gamete types.\n\nNow, building a Punnett square for F1\u00d7F1 would involve each F1 individual producing these four gametes. Each gamete from one parent combines with each gamete from the other parent.\n\nBut perhaps instead of constructing the entire Punnett square, I can analyze the possible outcomes based on the genetic cross.\n\nThe parents are CCBB (C_B_) and ccbb (c_bb). So, each parent produces gametes with the following combinations:\n\nFrom CCBB:\n- C (dominant for C)\n- B (dominant for B)\n\nFrom ccbb:\n- c (recessive for C)\n- b (recessive for B)\n\nSo, each F1 bird will produce gametes with either C or c for the C/B locus and B or b for the B/b locus. Therefore, the F1 genotype will be CcBb for each bird.\n\nSince both parents contribute the same gametes, every F1 bird will inherit CcBb, leading to the same F2 generation.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you cross F1\u00d7F1, the F2 generation isn't just the same as F1, because F1 itself is a heterozygote. So, the F2 will consist of F1\u00d7F1 individuals, meaning the F2 will be the cross of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratios, I'll need to look at the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nGene C (dominant = C, recessive = c):\n- CC (homozygous dominant)\n- Cc (heterozygous)\n- cc (homozygous recessive)\n\nGene B (dominant = B, recessive = b):\n- BB (homozygous dominant)\n- Bb (heterozygous)\n- bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nEach bird has these two genes independently assorting. So, the possible combinations are the product of the two independent traits.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratios, I can calculate the frequency of each genotype using the Hardy-Weinberg principle if the crosses are random and assuming no selection against any phenotype.\n\nBut wait, the parents are already known to produce certain genotypes. However, for the F2 generation resulting from F1\u00d7F1, the cross would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nCalculating the possible genotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Frequency of CC = (1/4 + 1/4 * something? Wait, no. Using H-W: p^2 + 2pq + q^2, where p is the probability of C and q of c.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B.\n\nAssuming the parents are randomly contributing, each allele has a 50% chance of passing on for each gene. But since both parents are Cc and Bb (wait, no, the F1 was CcBb; each gene is independently assorting), so for each gene, the allele distribution is 50% C and 50% c, and similarly for B and b.\n\nTherefore, for each gene, the genotype frequencies in the F2 will follow the H-W equation. For example, for gene C:\n\nIn F2, the frequency of CC is (1/2)^2 = 1/4,\n\nfrequency of Cc is 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2,\n\nand frequency of cc is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSame applies to gene B.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined genotype frequencies are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, for each combination of CC, Cc, and cc for gene C and BB, Bb, and bb for gene B, the combined genotype frequencies would be (1/4 * 1/4) for each.\n\nBut wait, combining these together, how many possible genotype combinations are there?\n\nThere are 3 possibilities for gene C (CC, Cc, cc) and 3 for gene B (BB, Bb, bb), making 9 possible genotype combinations.\n\nEach of these combinations will correspond to a specific phenotype based on the dominance of the alleles.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\nRed (R) is dominant over brown (r). Wait, no\u2014in our case, the alleles are B (red) and b (brown), so B is dominant for red, and b is dominant for brown? Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, the problem states:\n\nCheckered pattern is governed by dominant gene C.\n\nPlain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nRed color is dominant, brown is recessive.\n\nSo, plain color is represented by the recessive alleles: c for plain and b for brown. Wait, no\u2014it depends on the notation. Wait, the problem says:\n\nRed color is controlled by dominant gene B, and brown by recessive allele b.\n\nWait, that suggests that B is dominant for red, and b is dominant for brown? No, because typically, the dominant allele shows the trait. If B is dominant, then b would be recessive, but here it's stated as \"brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I got that reversed. Let's clarify:\n\nIf B is dominant, then b is recessive. So, if a bird has at least one B allele, it's red; otherwise, it's brown. Wait, but the problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by dominant gene B, and brown color by recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, that implies that having a B allele makes it red, and having a b allele makes it brown. So, the presence of B results in red color, and b results in brown.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive because usually, dominant alleles express the phenotype. But according to the problem statement, that's what's happening here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is dominant for one trait and b for another. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify whether the genes are linked or independent. It probably assumes they are independent.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nWait, but each bird has two loci: one for color (B/b) and one for pattern (C/c). So, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nSo, let's map the possible genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\n- BB \u2192 red\n- Bb \u2192 red\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nFor the pattern (C/c):\n\n- CC \u2192 checkered\n- Cc \u2192 checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nSince these genes are independent, the overall phenotype is a combination of the two traits.\n\nSo, the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Checkered and red \u2192 red-checkered\n2. Checkered and brown \u2192 brown-checkered\n3. Plain and red \u2192 red-plane\n4. Plain and brown \u2192 brown-plane\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is asked in terms of the number of each phenotype. To determine this, I need to know the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation.\n\nUsing H-W principles, the frequencies for each genotype can be calculated.\n\nFor gene C (pattern):\n\nIn F2, the frequency of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor gene B (color):\n\nIn F2, the frequency is also:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined frequencies are multiplied. For example, the frequency of CC (pattern) AND BB (color) is (25%)(25%) = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, for each combination of pattern and color:\n\n- CC BB: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25%)(50%) = 12.5%\n- CC bb: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: (50%)(25%) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: (50%)(50%) = 25%\n- Cc bb: (50%)(25%) = 12.5%\n- cc BB: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25%)(50%) = 12.5%\n- cc bb: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered and Red \u2192 Red-Checkered\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered and Brown \u2192 Brown-Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered and Brown (since bb is brown) \u2192 Brown-Checkered\nWait, no. Wait, for color, bb is brown. So:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 brown-checkered (because bb is brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered (since Bb is red)\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered (since Bb is red)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, no, because for color, bb is brown. So:\n\nLooking again:\n\nFor color:\n\n- BB \u2192 red\n- Bb \u2192 red\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nPattern:\n\n- CC \u2192 checkered\n- Cc \u2192 checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nSo, combining:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 brown-checkered (since bb is brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\nRed-Checkered occurs in CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 total of 6 instances.\nBrown-Checkered occurs in CC bb \u2192 1 instance.\nPlain-Red occurs in cc BB and cc Bb \u2192 2 instances.\nPlain-Brown occurs in cc bb \u2192 1 instance.\n\nWait, that adds up to 6+1+2+1=10, but each bird has two loci, so perhaps each occurrence represents one bird, so the counts are correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the F2 generation had a different count. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, each bird is a diploid, so each F2 individual is a combination of two parents, each with two alleles. So, the Punnett square approach should give me the correct counts.\n\nBut according to my previous calculation, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red-Checkered: 6\n- Brown-Checkered: 1\n- Plain-Red: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 1\n\nWhich sums up to 10. But the options provided don't include 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the H-W formula. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider the F2 generation as the cross of F1\u00d7F1, where F1 is CcBb. So, the F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nWait, but the F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be the next generation after that. So, each bird in F2 is a combination of two F1 birds. Therefore, the F2 population would consist of all possible combinations of the F1 parents, which includes all possible gametes from each F1 bird.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the F2 would have a phenotypic ratio of 6:2:6:2, which corresponds to option A. But let's see why.\n\nEach bird in F2 can be any combination of the F1 gametes. The F1 is CcBb, so each bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb (wait, actually, each F1 bird is CcBb, so gametes could be CB, cb, cB, and cb, but more accurately, each gamete would have one allele from each gene. So, for gene C: C or c, and for gene B: B or b.\n\nSo, the F1 bird can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB (from C and B)\n- 25% cb (from c and b)\n- 25% cB (from c and B)\n- 25% cb (from c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014each gamete must combine one allele from each gene. So, the gametes are:\n\n- From C: C or c (each 50%)\n- From B: B or b (each 50%)\n\nSo, the possible gametes are CB, cB, CB, cb, etc. Actually, the possible gametes are CB, cB, CB, cb, cB, cb, etc., but considering the 50% chance for each allele, the gametes are:\n\n- CB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n- cB: 25%\n- bc: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014gene C has alleles C and c, and gene B has B and b. So, for gene C, the gamete can be C or c, each with 50%. For gene B, the gamete can be B or b, each with 50%. So, the possible gamete combinations are:\n\n- C (from C) and B (from B) \u2192 CB\n- C (from C) and b (from B) \u2192 Cb\n- c (from C) and B (from B) \u2192 cB\n- c (from C) and b (from B) \u2192 cb\n\nEach of these gametes has a 25% chance.\n\nNow, when F1\u00d7F1 is crossed, each F1 bird produces these four types of gametes. So, the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of these gametes from two F1 parents.\n\nThis creates a Punnett square with 16 possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, actually, each bird is CcBb, so gametes are as above.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the Punnett square correctly.\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (each 25%).\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have each F1 bird contributing one gamete, so each F2 bird inherits two gametes (one from each F1 parent). Wait, no\u2014each F1 bird can produce one gamete, and F2 is the cross between two such F1 birds. So, each F2 bird is formed by the combination of one gamete from each F1 parent.\n\nThus, the possible F2 genotypes are the products of",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two birds being crossed: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). I need to find the phenotypic ratio of their offspring, specifically in the F2 generation. There are several parts to this: identifying the possible gametes, creating a Punnett square, determining the genotypes and phenotypes, calculating the frequencies, and then comparing them to the given options.\n\nStarting with the alleles involved:\n\nFor the first parent (checkered red): CCBB means they have two dominant alleles for both genes. So, CC (for the checkered part) and BB (for red color).\n\nThe second parent (plain brown): ccbb has two recessive alleles for each gene. 'c' is for plain, and 'b' is for brown.\n\nSo, when these two parents mate, the F1 generation will be the result of crossing CCBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, actually, no\u2014the question says to consider an F1\u00d7F1 cross because the F2 comes from that. But let me focus on the initial F1\u00d7F1 cross.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the actual cross first. The problem says \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So, the parents are CCBB and ccbb.\n\nWhen you cross CCBB (homozygous dominant) with ccbb (homozygous recessive), all the offspring will be CcBb. Because each parent contributes either C or c for the first gene and B or b for the second gene. Since CCBB is homozygous dominant, all its gametes will carry the dominant alleles. Similarly, ccbb is homozygous recessive, so all its gametes will carry the recessive alleles.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation from this cross will all be CcBb. Now, since we're looking at the F2 generation, which comes from F1\u00d7F1, but wait\u2014no, the F2 is actually from F1\u00d7F1 where F1 is CcBb. So each F1 bird can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb again. That gives us four possible gamete types.\n\nNow, building a Punnett square for F1\u00d7F1 would involve each F1 individual producing these four gametes. Each gamete from one parent combines with each gamete from the other parent.\n\nBut perhaps instead of constructing the entire Punnett square, I can analyze the possible outcomes based on the genetic cross.\n\nThe parents are CCBB (C_B_) and ccbb (c_bb). So, each parent produces gametes with the following combinations:\n\nFrom CCBB:\n- C (dominant for C)\n- B (dominant for B)\n\nFrom ccbb:\n- c (recessive for C)\n- b (recessive for B)\n\nSo, each F1 bird will produce gametes with either C or c for the C/B locus and B or b for the B/b locus. Therefore, the F1 genotype will be CcBb for each bird.\n\nSince both parents contribute the same gametes, every F1 bird will inherit CcBb, leading to the same F2 generation.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you cross F1\u00d7F1, the F2 generation isn't just the same as F1, because F1 itself is a heterozygote. So, the F2 will consist of F1\u00d7F1 individuals, meaning the F2 will be the cross of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nTo determine the phenotypic ratios, I'll need to look at the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nGene C (dominant = C, recessive = c):\n- CC (homozygous dominant)\n- Cc (heterozygous)\n- cc (homozygous recessive)\n\nGene B (dominant = B, recessive = b):\n- BB (homozygous dominant)\n- Bb (heterozygous)\n- bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nEach bird has these two genes independently assorting. So, the possible combinations are the product of the two independent traits.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratios, I can calculate the frequency of each genotype using the Hardy-Weinberg principle if the crosses are random and assuming no selection against any phenotype.\n\nBut wait, the parents are already known to produce certain genotypes. However, for the F2 generation resulting from F1\u00d7F1, the cross would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nCalculating the possible genotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Frequency of CC = (1/4 + 1/4 * something? Wait, no. Using H-W: p^2 + 2pq + q^2, where p is the probability of C and q of c.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B.\n\nAssuming the parents are randomly contributing, each allele has a 50% chance of passing on for each gene. But since both parents are Cc and Bb (wait, no, the F1 was CcBb; each gene is independently assorting), so for each gene, the allele distribution is 50% C and 50% c, and similarly for B and b.\n\nTherefore, for each gene, the genotype frequencies in the F2 will follow the H-W equation.

Wait, no\u2014in our case, the alleles are B (red) and b (brown), so B is dominant for red, and b is dominant for brown? Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, the problem states:\n\nCheckered pattern is governed by dominant gene C.\n\nPlain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nRed color is dominant, brown is recessive.\n\nSo, plain color is represented by the recessive alleles: c for plain and b for brown.

No, because typically, the dominant allele shows the trait. If B is dominant, then b would be recessive, but here it's stated as \"brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I got that reversed. Let's clarify:\n\nIf B is dominant, then b is recessive. So, if a bird has at least one B allele, it's red; otherwise, it's brown. Wait, but the problem says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by dominant gene B, and brown color by recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, that implies that having a B allele makes it red, and having a b allele makes it brown. So, the presence of B results in red color, and b results in brown.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive because usually, dominant alleles express the phenotype. But according to the problem statement, that's what's happening here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is dominant for one trait and b for another. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify whether the genes are linked or independent. It probably assumes they are independent.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nWait, but each bird has two loci: one for color (B/b) and one for pattern (C/c). So, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nSo, let's map the possible genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\n- BB \u2192 red\n- Bb \u2192 red\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nFor the pattern (C/c):\n\n- CC \u2192 checkered\n- Cc \u2192 checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nSince these genes are independent, the overall phenotype is a combination of the two traits.\n\nSo, the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Checkered and red \u2192 red-checkered\n2. Checkered and brown \u2192 brown-checkered\n3. Plain and red \u2192 red-plane\n4. Plain and brown \u2192 brown-plane\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is asked in terms of the number of each phenotype. To determine this, I need to know the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation.\n\nUsing H-W principles, the frequencies for each genotype can be calculated.\n\nFor gene C (pattern):\n\nIn F2, the frequency of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor gene B (color):\n\nIn F2, the frequency is also:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined frequencies are multiplied. For example, the frequency of CC (pattern) AND BB (color) is (25%)(25%) = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, for each combination of pattern and color:\n\n- CC BB: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25%)(50%) = 12.5%\n- CC bb: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: (50%)(25%) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: (50%)(50%) = 25%\n- Cc bb: (50%)(25%) = 12.5%\n- cc BB: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25%)(50%) = 12.5%\n- cc bb: (25%)(25%) = 6.25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered and Red \u2192 Red-Checkered\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered and Brown \u2192 Brown-Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered and Brown (since bb is brown) \u2192 Brown-Checkered\nWait, no. Wait, for color, bb is brown. So:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 brown-checkered (because bb is brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered (since Bb is red)\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered (since Bb is red)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, no, because for color, bb is brown. So:\n\nLooking again:\n\nFor color:\n\n- BB \u2192 red\n- Bb \u2192 red\n- bb \u2192 brown\n\nPattern:\n\n- CC \u2192 checkered\n- Cc \u2192 checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nSo, combining:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC Bb \u2192 brown-checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 brown-checkered (since bb is brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-red\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-red\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\nRed-Checkered occurs in CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 total of 6 instances.\nBrown-Checkered occurs in CC bb \u2192 1 instance.\nPlain-Red occurs in cc BB and cc Bb \u2192 2 instances.\nPlain-Brown occurs in cc bb \u2192 1 instance.\n\nWait, that adds up to 6+1+2+1=10, but each bird has two loci, so perhaps each occurrence represents one bird, so the counts are correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the F2 generation had a different count. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, each bird is a diploid, so each F2 individual is a combination of two parents, each with two alleles. So, the Punnett square approach should give me the correct counts.\n\nBut according to my previous calculation, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red-Checkered: 6\n- Brown-Checkered: 1\n- Plain-Red: 2\n- Plain-Brown: 1\n\nWhich sums up to 10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the H-W formula. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider the F2 generation as the cross of F1\u00d7F1, where F1 is CcBb. So, the F2 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nWait, but the F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be the next generation after that. So, each bird in F2 is a combination of two F1 birds. Therefore, the F2 population would consist of all possible combinations of the F1 parents, which includes all possible gametes from each F1 bird.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the F2 would have a phenotypic ratio of 6:2:6:2, which corresponds to option A. But let's see why.\n\nEach bird in F2 can be any combination of the F1 gametes. The F1 is CcBb, so each bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb (wait, actually, each F1 bird is CcBb, so gametes could be CB, cb, cB, and cb, but more accurately, each gamete would have one allele from each gene. So, for gene C: C or c, and for gene B: B or b.\n\nSo, the F1 bird can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB (from C and B)\n- 25% cb (from c and b)\n- 25% cB (from c and B)\n- 25% cb (from c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014each gamete must combine one allele from each gene. So, the gametes are:\n\n- From C: C or c (each 50%)\n- From B: B or b (each 50%)\n\nSo, the possible gametes are CB, cB, CB, cb, etc. Actually, the possible gametes are CB, cB, CB, cb, cB, cb, etc., but considering the 50% chance for each allele, the gametes are:\n\n- CB: 25%\n- cb: 25%\n- cB: 25%\n- bc: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014gene C has alleles C and c, and gene B has B and b. So, for gene C, the gamete can be C or c, each with 50%. For gene B, the gamete can be B or b, each with 50%. So, the possible gamete combinations are:\n\n- C (from C) and B (from B) \u2192 CB\n- C (from C) and b (from B) \u2192 Cb\n- c (from C) and B (from B) \u2192 cB\n- c (from C) and b (from B) \u2192 cb\n\nEach of these gametes has a 25% chance.\n\nNow, when F1\u00d7F1 is crossed, each F1 bird produces these four types of gametes. So, the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of these gametes from two F1 parents.\n\nThis creates a Punnett square with 16 possible combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, actually, each bird is CcBb, so gametes are as above.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the Punnett square correctly.\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (each 25%).\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have each F1 bird contributing one gamete, so each F2 bird inherits two gametes (one from each F1 parent). Wait, no\u2014each F1 bird can produce one gamete, and F2 is the cross between two such F1 birds. So, each F2 bird is formed by the combination of one gamete from each F1 parent.\n\nThus, the possible F2 genotypes are the products of",

The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- Gene C controls checkered pattern. So, it's probably an autosomal dominant trait because the birds are checkered.\n- Gene B determines red color, which is dominant. So, if someone has at least one B allele, they'll be red.\n- Gene c is recessive, so it would mask the effect of B. If someone has two c alleles, they're plain.\n  \nThe parents involved are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). Wait, no, hold on\u2014the parents have different genotypes. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, the first parent is CCBB. Since both genes are dominant, their genotype would be CC for C (since they're homozygous) and BB for B. But wait, no\u2014wait, the notation might be different. Maybe CC is for the first gene, and BB for the second? Or perhaps each uppercase letter represents a separate gene. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nActually, in genetics, when you see something like CCBB, it usually means two separate genes, each with two letters. So, for example, CC could represent the presence of the dominant allele for one gene, and BB for the other. Alternatively, sometimes it's split as CC and BB, meaning CC for one gene and BB for another.\n\nBut in any case, the parents are CCBB (probably heterozygous for both C and B) and ccbb (homozygous recessive for both c and b).\n\nNow, the cross is between these two birds: CCBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the F1 generation from this cross. Then, the F1 will self-multiply to get the F2 generation. From there, we can analyze the phenotypes.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the F1 generation.\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 Genotype for C is CC, for B is BB. Since both are dominant, all offspring will display the dominant phenotype for both traits.\n\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 Genotype for c is cc, for b is bb. Both are recessive, so all offspring will display the recessive phenotype for both traits.\n\nTherefore, the F1 cross should result in all offspring being checkered red (since they have at least one C and at least one B allele), regardless of the other genes. But wait, since the parents are CCBB and ccbb, the F1 should be Cc for C (from CC and cc) and Bb for B (from BB and bb)? No, wait, each parent contributes one allele per gene. So for the C gene, Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c. Similarly, for B, Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b.\n\nThus, F1 genotype for C: Cc (since C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2)\nFor B: Bb (same reasoning)\n\nSo F1 individuals are CcBb, right? Because they inherit one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nNow, moving to F2 generation. We'll need to consider the F1 as parents for selfing or interbreeding.\n\nSince the F1 are CcBb, we can model their gametes using a Punnett square. Each gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with the C gene:\n- Parent: Cc\n- Gametes: 50% C, 50% c\n\nSimilarly, for B gene:\n- Parent: Bb\n- Gametes: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo, the possible combinations for each gene are:\n\n- C: C or c\n- B: B or b\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotype will be (C/B), (C/b), (c/B), (c/b).\n\nNow, considering dominance and recessiveness:\n- For C: C_ (dominant) shows checkered pattern. cc shows plain.\n- For B: B_ (red color) shows red. bb shows brown.\n\nSo, each bird will have a combination of these traits.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypes for each bird are:\n1. Checkered red (CC_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (CcB_)\n3. Plain red (ccB_)\n4. Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nWait, but the F2 from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb should yield the following phenotypes based on the Punnett square.\n\nBut let's create the Punnett square properly.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb. When they self-pollinate, the possible gametes are:\n\n- C/B: 25%\n- C/b: 25%\n- c/B: 25%\n- c/b: 25%\n\nSo, the Punnett square will look like:\n\n```\n      |   |   |\n      |---|---|---|\n    C  | C/B | C/b | c/B | c/b\n    B  | C/B | C/b | c/B | c/b\n```\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be combining the gametes correctly. Each row and column represents the gamete types for each gene.\n\nBut actually, for simplicity, since each gene is independent, we can compute the probabilities separately and then multiply.\n\nFor the C gene:\n- C_: 50% (C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2)\n- cc: 50%\n\nFor the B gene:\n- B_: 50% (B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2)\n- bb: 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo, the probability of each combination is (probability for C) \u00d7 (probability for B).\n\nPossible combinations and their probabilities:\n\n1. C_ and B_: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C_ and bb: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc and B_: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc and bb: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four phenotypes with equal probabilities of 25%.

This adds up to 16, which makes sense because 1+3+9+3=16, corresponding to 1/16 each.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, each phenotype should occur 25%, which is 1/4 of the total. So, if we take a large sample size, say 16, we'd expect 4 of each. But looking back at the options, none directly match this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the parents.\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 Genotype for C is CC, for B is BB.\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 Genotype for c is cc, for b is bb.\n\nWhen they mate, each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1: C\n- Parent 2: c\nSo, F1 has Cc, which means some have C and some have c.\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1: B\n- Parent 2: b\nSo, F1 has Bb, meaning some have B and some have b.\n\nThus, F1 individuals are CcBb, each with a 25% chance of having any combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs, the F2 will have combinations based on these.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes would indeed be 25% each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the options don't include such a ratio. Let me check again.\n\nWait, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16, which aligns with 1/16 each.\n\nThat suggests that each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, but grouped into categories where more common ones have higher counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype in terms of the actual F2 population, assuming each gamete is equally likely.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer would be option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

Let me re-examine the parents.\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 Genotype for C is CC, for B is BB.\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 Genotype for c is cc, for b is bb.\n\nWhen they mate, each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1: C\n- Parent 2: c\nSo, F1 has Cc, which means some have C and some have c.\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1: B\n- Parent 2: b\nSo, F1 has Bb, meaning some have B and some have b.\n\nThus, F1 individuals are CcBb, each with a 25% chance of having any combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs, the F2 will have combinations based on these.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes would indeed be 25% each, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the options don't include such a ratio. Let me check again.\n\nWait, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total 16, which aligns with 1/16 each.\n\nThat suggests that each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, but grouped into categories where more common ones have higher counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype in terms of the actual F2 population, assuming each gamete is equally likely.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer would be option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Because 1+3+9+3=16, which corresponds to 25% each.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

One bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means its genotype must be CC BB since it's homozygous. The other bird is a plain brown bird, so its genotype should be cc bb because it's homozygous as well.\n\nThe traits involved are:\n- Gene C determines checkered vs. plain color. So uppercase C is checkered, lowercase c is plain.\n- Gene B determines red vs. brown. Uppercase B is red, lowercase b is brown.\n\nThey want an A Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two parents. Wait, wait\u2014adihybrid cross? Oh, maybe they meant dihybrid cross, but the term isn't standard. Anyway, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let's outline the possible gametes each parent can produce.\n\nParent 1 (checkered red): CC BB. Since both alleles are dominant, it will produce only one type of gamete. It'll produce gametes CB or cb? Wait no\u2014if it's homozygous CC BB, all gametes will carry the dominant alleles. So it will produce either CB or cb. But wait, wait\u2014the bird is already checkered red, so all offspring from this bird would also be checkered red or plain red based on their other parent's alleles. Hmm, perhaps I got confused here.\n\nWait, no\u2014the bird in question is the parent for the cross. Let me clarify:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB. This bird is homozygous for both genes. So when it produces gametes, it can only give CB or cb. Wait, actually, no\u2014that's not right. If it's homozygous CC BB, then all gametes will carry the dominant alleles for both genes. So the only gamete it can produce is CB or cb?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if you're homozygous for both dominant alleles, your gametes will always have the dominant allele for both genes. So for example, if it's CC BB, the gametes will all be CB. Because any combination where you get at least one dominant allele for each gene is okay, but since it's homozygous, it's just CB.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2: cc bb. This bird is homozygous recessive, so it can only produce gametes that carry the recessive alleles. So it will produce cb gametes.\n\nNow, we need to cross these two parents: Parent 1 (CC BB) \u00d7 Parent 2 (cc bb). Wait, no\u2014I think I mixed up the parents' roles. Actually, the first parent is the one producing the adihybrid cross. Wait, the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the parents are Homozygous CC BB (checkered red) and Homozygous cc bb (plain brown).\n\nSo when they cross, the F1 generation would be Cc BB x Cc bb? No, wait, no\u2014it's Homozygous parents, so all gametes come from them. Wait, no\u2014the parents are Homozygous, so their gametes are fixed. So Homozygous CC BB can only produce CB gametes, and Homozygous cc bb can only produce cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, no, wait\u2014the parents are Homozygous, so their gametes are all CB and cb. So when they mate, the F1 would be all CB \u00d7 cb. But wait, no\u2014they can only produce gametes that are either CB or cb. So F1 would be all Cc Bb? Wait, no\u2014that's if they were heterozygotes. Since these are homozygous, their gametes are fixed.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are Homozygous CC BB (so they can only produce CB gametes), and cc bb (they can only produce cb gametes). Therefore, F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, no\u2014actually, they cross each other, so F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. But since both parents are homozygous, their gametes are fixed. So F1 would consist of all Cc Bb? Or wait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene. Wait, no, F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, that makes sense because the parents are Homozygous, so all gametes are fixed.\n\nBut now, after F1, we need to do another cross to get F2. Wait, no\u2014the question asks about the F2 generation. So starting from the F1, which comes from a cross between Homozygous parents, but then we go back to F1 and do another cross to get F2.\n\nWait, no\u2014the initial cross is between Homozygous parents, resulting in F1 which is Heterozygous for both genes. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. But the question seems to ask about a dihybrid cross between Homozygous parents. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are Homozygous, and we're considering F1 and F2, but the question might be asking about a dihybrid cross between two different species, like Parent 1: CC BB and Parent 2: cc bb. Wait, but that wouldn't make sense because they're different species. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the parents are Homozygous CC BB and cc bb. They cross each other to produce F1, which is Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, no\u2014parents are Homozygous, so F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb, but that's not possible because you can't cross Homozygous to get F1. Instead, you'd cross two different species, but that's not stated here.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try again.\n\nThe parents are Homozygous CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). When crossed, their F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. Wait, no\u2014wait, you can't cross Homozygous individuals to get F1. Instead, you'd cross different species. But the question specifies Homozygous parents, so perhaps it's a mistake, and they meant Heterozygous parents. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant a dihybrid cross between two different species.\n\nAssuming that's the case, let's proceed with the dihybrid cross between two different species, where each bird can produce gametes with combinations of alleles. Each bird's gametes would determine the traits.\n\nWait, but the question specifically mentions the checkered pattern, etc., which suggests that the parents are of the same species but have different genotypes. But that doesn't make much sense because they would be the same bird. So perhaps the parents are two different species, each with certain genotypes. That makes more sense.\n\nSo Parent 1: CC BB (checkered red)\n\nParent 2: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. But since they're different species, this cross isn't valid. So instead, we should look at the F1 from a dihybrid cross within one species, but that contradicts the initial statement. I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are Homozygous and we're looking at a dihybrid cross within a species, but that doesn't align with the problem description.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think differently. The problem states that the checkered pattern is due to gene C (dominant C, recessive c), and the color is due to B (dominant B, recessive b). The birds are checkered-red and plain-brown.\n\nSo the parents are:\n\nParent 1: Checkered red \u2192 CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nCrossing them would result in F1, which would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. But since these are different species, F1 would be a mix of both species, which isn't meaningful. So perhaps the intended approach is to treat them as the same species, meaning both are Homozygous CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 being Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb, but that would require different species.\n\nThis confusion suggests that perhaps the parents are of the same species but different genotypes. For example, Parent 1: CC BB (checkered red) and Parent 2: cc bb (plain brown). Their F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb. However, since these are same-species birds, their offspring would have to be diploid, so we can model their offspring using a Punnett square.\n\nWait, but the question is about F2 generation, so we need to perform another cross on F1 to get F2.\n\nLet me try to structure this properly.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nCrossing these would produce F1, but since these are same-species birds, F1 would be all Cc BB and cc bb, but since they're same-species, their offspring would be diploid. Wait, no\u2014the F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb, but since these are same-species, the offspring would inherit one allele from each parent, making them diploid. So each offspring would have two chromosomes, one from each parent.\n\nThus, the F1 would consist of Cc for gene C and BB for gene B, plus cc for gene C and bb for gene B.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So Parent 1 contributes C and B, while Parent 2 contributes c and b. Thus, F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2)? No, wait\u2014no, because Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, contributing c and b. Therefore, F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2), but wait, no\u2014because each bird contributes one allele per gene, so F1 would have Cc (for gene C) and Bb (for gene B)?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because each bird has two copies of each gene. So F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2), but combined into a single bird, so each bird in F1 would have Cc and Bb, but wait, that's impossible because each bird has two alleles for each gene. So each F1 bird would have one allele from each parent, so for gene C: Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 Cc. For gene B: Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 Bb. So each F1 bird is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, the F1 would mate to produce F2. But wait, the question is about the F2 generation, so we need to cross F1 with itself.\n\nWait, but the question starts with the parents as Homozygous checkered red and plain brown. So perhaps the correct way is to cross Homozygous CC BB (checkered red) with cc bb (plain brown). But that's impossible because you can't cross Homozygous to get F1. Instead, you'd have to cross different species, but that's not applicable here.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the setup. Perhaps the parents are same-species birds with different genotypes. For example, Parent 1: CC BB (checkered red) and Parent 2: cc bb (plain brown). When crossed, F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb, but since these are same species, the offspring would have to be diploid. Wait, no\u2014since each bird has two alleles, the F1 would be Cc BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2), but combining into a single bird, each bird would receive one allele from each parent. So F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2)? No, because Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, contributing c and b. So F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2). But each bird in F1 would have two alleles for each gene, so Cc (gene C) and Bb (gene B). But wait, that's impossible because each bird has two alleles for each gene. So each F1 bird would have C and c for gene C, and B and b for gene B.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird in F1 would be Cc Bb. Because Parent 1 gives C and B, and Parent 2 gives c and b. So each F1 bird has Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2), but combined into a single bird, which would have two Cs and two Bs? No, that doesn't make sense. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. So F1 would be Cc (gene C) and Bb (gene B), but since each bird has two copies, F1 would be Cc Bb. Wait, but that would mean each F1 bird has one C and one c for gene C, and one B and one b for gene B. So each F1 bird is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, when F1 crosses with itself to get F2, the Punnett square would be for Cc \u00d7 Cc and Bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014each bird is Cc Bb, so F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2. Wait, no\u2014the parents are F1 and F1, so F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nBut the question is about the F2 generation. So let's set that up.\n\nEach F1 bird is Cc Bb. So when they mate, each parent contributes one allele for gene C and one for gene B.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1 contributes C or c\n- Parent 2 contributes C or c\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1 contributes B or b\n- Parent 2 contributes B or b\n\nSo the possible gametes for each gene are independent.\n\nTo create the Punnett square for F2:\n\nGene C:\n- Parents: Cc \u00d7 Cc\n- Possible gametes: C and c\n\nGene B:\n- Parents: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n- Possible gametes: B and b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the Punnett square combines the gametes for C and B.\n\nSo the F2 will have four combinations:\n- Cc (from C gamete) and Bb (from B gamete)\n- Cc (from C gamete) and B (from B gamete)\n- c (from C gamete) and Bb (from B gamete)\n- c (from C gamete) and b (from B gamete)\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene is separate, so the F2 square for gene C and gene B would be:\n\nFor gene C:\n- C \u00d7 Cc \u2192 C and c\n- c \u00d7 Cc \u2192 c and c\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n- B \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B and b\n- b \u00d7 Bb \u2192 b and b\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The correct way is:\n\nGene C:\n- From Parent 1: Cc\n- From Parent 2: Cc\n- Gametes: C (25%), c (25%) [Wait, no\u2014each parent produces two alleles, so Cc would produce C and c.]\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct Punnett square for gene C in F2:\n\nParent 1: Cc\nParent 2: Cc\n\nGametes:\n- C from Parent 1\n- c from Parent 1\n- C from Parent 2\n- c from Parent 2\n\nSo F2 for gene C:\n- 25% CC (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n- 50% Cc (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5)\n- 25% cc (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\nParent 1: Bb\nParent 2: Bb\n\nGametes:\n- B from Parent 1\n- b from Parent 1\n- B from Parent 2\n- b from Parent 2\n\nF2 for gene B:\n- 25% BB (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n- 50% Bb (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5)\n- 25% bb (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 phenotype ratios depend on the dominance of alleles.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- For gene C:\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n- For gene B:\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 brown\n\nPhenotype expression combines the genotypes for both genes. Each trait is expressed independently, unless there's interaction, which I don't think applies here.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are combinations of the genotypes for C and B.\n\nEach F2 bird's phenotype is determined by whether they express C (checkered or plain) and B (red or brown).\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\nCheckered Red (C_B)\nCheckered Brown (C_bb)\nPlain Red (cc_B)\nPlain Brown (cc_bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nThe probability of each genotype combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities for each gene to get the combined probabilities.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CC \u00d7 BB):\n   - Probability for C: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 25%\n   - Combined: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\n2. Checkered Brown (CC \u00d7 bb):\n   - Probability for C: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 25%\n   - Combined: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\n3. Plain Red (cc \u00d7 BB):\n   -",

However, since these are same-species birds, their offspring would have to be diploid, so we can model their offspring using a Punnett square.\n\nWait, but the question is about F2 generation, so we need to perform another cross on F1 to get F2.\n\nLet me try to structure this properly.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (checkered red)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nCrossing these would produce F1, but since these are same-species birds, F1 would be all Cc BB and cc bb, but since they're same-species, their offspring would be diploid. Wait, no\u2014the F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb, but since these are same-species, the offspring would inherit one allele from each parent, making them diploid. So each offspring would have two chromosomes, one from each parent.\n\nThus, the F1 would consist of Cc for gene C and BB for gene B, plus cc for gene C and bb for gene B.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So Parent 1 contributes C and B, while Parent 2 contributes c and b. Thus, F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2)? No, wait\u2014no, because Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, contributing c and b. Therefore, F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2), but wait, no\u2014because each bird contributes one allele per gene, so F1 would have Cc (for gene C) and Bb (for gene B)?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because each bird has two copies of each gene. So F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2), but combined into a single bird, so each bird in F1 would have Cc and Bb, but wait, that's impossible because each bird has two alleles for each gene. So each F1 bird would have one allele from each parent, so for gene C: Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 Cc. For gene B: Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 Bb. So each F1 bird is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, the F1 would mate to produce F2. But wait, the question is about the F2 generation, so we need to cross F1 with itself.\n\nWait, but the question starts with the parents as Homozygous checkered red and plain brown. So perhaps the correct way is to cross Homozygous CC BB (checkered red) with cc bb (plain brown). But that's impossible because you can't cross Homozygous to get F1. Instead, you'd have to cross different species, but that's not applicable here.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the setup. Perhaps the parents are same-species birds with different genotypes. For example, Parent 1: CC BB (checkered red) and Parent 2: cc bb (plain brown). When crossed, F1 would be Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb, but since these are same species, the offspring would have to be diploid. Wait, no\u2014since each bird has two alleles, the F1 would be Cc BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2), but combining into a single bird, each bird would receive one allele from each parent. So F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2)? No, because Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, contributing c and b. So F1 would be Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2). But each bird in F1 would have two alleles for each gene, so Cc (gene C) and Bb (gene B). But wait, that's impossible because each bird has two alleles for each gene. So each F1 bird would have C and c for gene C, and B and b for gene B.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird in F1 would be Cc Bb. Because Parent 1 gives C and B, and Parent 2 gives c and b. So each F1 bird has Cc (from Parent 1) and Bb (from Parent 2), but combined into a single bird, which would have two Cs and two Bs? No, that doesn't make sense. Each bird has two alleles for each gene. So F1 would be Cc (gene C) and Bb (gene B), but since each bird has two copies, F1 would be Cc Bb. Wait, but that would mean each F1 bird has one C and one c for gene C, and one B and one b for gene B. So each F1 bird is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, when F1 crosses with itself to get F2, the Punnett square would be for Cc \u00d7 Cc and Bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014each bird is Cc Bb, so F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2. Wait, no\u2014the parents are F1 and F1, so F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nBut the question is about the F2 generation. So let's set that up.\n\nEach F1 bird is Cc Bb. So when they mate, each parent contributes one allele for gene C and one for gene B.\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1 contributes C or c\n- Parent 2 contributes C or c\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1 contributes B or b\n- Parent 2 contributes B or b\n\nSo the possible gametes for each gene are independent.\n\nTo create the Punnett square for F2:\n\nGene C:\n- Parents: Cc \u00d7 Cc\n- Possible gametes: C and c\n\nGene B:\n- Parents: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n- Possible gametes: B and b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the Punnett square combines the gametes for C and B.\n\nSo the F2 will have four combinations:\n- Cc (from C gamete) and Bb (from B gamete)\n- Cc (from C gamete) and B (from B gamete)\n- c (from C gamete) and Bb (from B gamete)\n- c (from C gamete) and b (from B gamete)\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene is separate, so the F2 square for gene C and gene B would be:\n\nFor gene C:\n- C \u00d7 Cc \u2192 C and c\n- c \u00d7 Cc \u2192 c and c\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n- B \u00d7 Bb \u2192 B and b\n- b \u00d7 Bb \u2192 b and b\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The correct way is:\n\nGene C:\n- From Parent 1: Cc\n- From Parent 2: Cc\n- Gametes: C (25%), c (25%) [Wait, no\u2014each parent produces two alleles, so Cc would produce C and c.]\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct Punnett square for gene C in F2:\n\nParent 1: Cc\nParent 2: Cc\n\nGametes:\n- C from Parent 1\n- c from Parent 1\n- C from Parent 2\n- c from Parent 2\n\nSo F2 for gene C:\n- 25% CC (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n- 50% Cc (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5)\n- 25% cc (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\nParent 1: Bb\nParent 2: Bb\n\nGametes:\n- B from Parent 1\n- b from Parent 1\n- B from Parent 2\n- b from Parent 2\n\nF2 for gene B:\n- 25% BB (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n- 50% Bb (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5)\n- 25% bb (probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 phenotype ratios depend on the dominance of alleles.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- For gene C:\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n- For gene B:\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 brown\n\nPhenotype expression combines the genotypes for both genes. Each trait is expressed independently, unless there's interaction, which I don't think applies here.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are combinations of the genotypes for C and B.\n\nEach F2 bird's phenotype is determined by whether they express C (checkered or plain) and B (red or brown).\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\nCheckered Red (C_B)\nCheckered Brown (C_bb)\nPlain Red (cc_B)\nPlain Brown (cc_bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nThe probability of each genotype combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities for each gene to get the combined probabilities.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CC \u00d7 BB):\n   - Probability for C: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 25%\n   - Combined: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\n2. Checkered Brown (CC \u00d7 bb):\n   - Probability for C: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 25%\n   - Combined: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\n3. Plain Red (cc \u00d7 BB):\n   -",

    "rollout": " It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and another that's plain brown. I need to find the phenotypic ratio after an F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down what each parent bird is contributing. The checkered red bird has the genotype CC BB because it's homozygous checkered red. The plain brown bird has cc bb since it's homozygous plain brown.\n\nNow, when they mate, their offspring will be F1. Each F1 bird can have gametes CB, cb, cB, or cb. So there are four possible combinations, making the F1 generation CcBB \u00d7 CcBB? Wait, no, both parents are CC BB and cc bb, but actually, wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe first parent is CC BB, meaning both genes are dominant (checkered red), and the second parent is cc bb, meaning both genes are recessive (plain brown). When these two mate, all the offspring will receive one C from the first parent and one c from the second parent. Similarly, for the B and b alleles, the first parent gives B and the second gives b. So the F1 should all be CcBb. That makes sense because CC BB crossed with cc bb would produce CcBb in all cases.\n\nWait, but the question mentions showing F1 as CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, which suggests that the F1 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. But in reality, all the F1 would be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F1 would be CcBb for both parents.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. Since F1 is CcBb, the next generation would involve selfing. To determine the F2 phenotypes, I'll use a Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- The C locus: C (dominant) and c (recessive)\n- The B locus: B (dominant) and b (recessive)\n\nEach gene is independent, so I can analyze them separately.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of CC = 25%\n- Probability of Cc = 50%\n- Probability of cc = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Same probabilities apply.\n- So, the Punnett square for each gene will look like:\n\n```\n     C   cc\n    + B   Bb\n    + b   bB\n```\n\nBut more accurately, the F2 would have each gene segregating independently. So combining both loci, we get:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the possible genotypic combinations would include:\n\nCC BB, CC Bb, CC bb,\nCc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb,\ncc BB, cc Bb, cc bb\n\nEach combination will result in different phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Checkered (C) determines if it's red or brown (B).\n- Plain (c) determines if it's red or brown (b).\n\nSo:\n- If C is present, it's red.\n  - If B is present, it's checkered red (C_B_).\n  - If not, it's checkered brown (C_bb).\n- If c is present, it's brown.\n  - If B is present, it's plain brown (bb_b_).\n  - If not, it's plain red (bbbb).\n\nWait, no\u2014wait. The checkered color is determined by the presence of at least one C allele. So any bird with at least one C is red. Then, the B allele determines if it's checkered (B present) or plain (not B).\n\nSimilarly, for brown, any bird with at least one b is brown. The B allele determines checkered (B present) or plain (no B).\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nLet me create a table for each possible genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 bb_b_ \u2192 Bb_b_ \u2192 No C, so brown, but B is present \u2192 Checkered Brown?\nWait, no. If a bird doesn't have C, it's brown, regardless of B. Because the checkered color is determined by having at least one C. So if a bird is cc bb, then it's brown without any C, so it's plain brown?\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\n- Checkered: presence of C allele \u2192 red\n  - Presence of B allele \u2192 checkered red\n  - Absence of B allele \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain: absence of C allele \u2192 brown\n  - Presence of B allele \u2192 plain brown\n  - Absence of B allele \u2192 plain red\n\nSo for each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (red), B (red) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 same as above \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (red), b (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (red), B (red) \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (red), b (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c (brown), B (red) \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c (brown), b (brown) \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap. Let's count how many of each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible genotypes in F2: 16 (since each gene splits into 4 possibilities, so 4x4=16).\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- Checkered Red: Any genotype where at least one C and at least one B. Looking back:\n  - 1. CC BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 2. CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n  - 4. Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 5. Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 4\n\n- Checkered Brown: Genotypes where C is present but b is present (so B is absent).\n  - 3. CC bb \u2192 Yes\n  - 6. Cc bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 2\n\n- Checkered Plain: Genotypes where c is present, but B is absent.\n  - 7. cc BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 8. cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 2\n\n- Plain Brown: Genotypes where neither C nor B are present (all c and b).\n  - 9. cc bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 1\n\nWait, but looking back, I might have miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nCheckered Red: All that have at least one C and at least one B. From the list:\n- 1,2,4,5: 4\n- 3: CC bb \u2192 yes\n- 6: Cc bb \u2192 yes\n- 7: cc BB \u2192 yes\n- 8: cc Bb \u2192 yes\n- 9: cc bb \u2192 yes\n\nWait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Bb_b_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 b_b_b_ \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me approach differently.\n\nEach gene (C and B) segregates independently into 2:1 ratio (C:cc 2:1). So each gene has 2/3 chance of being C and 1/3 chance of being c.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, I'll calculate the number of each phenotype based on the probability.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb:\n\nThe possible genotypic combinations are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nEach of these will produce specific phenotypes.\n\nNow, mapping each genotype to phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, no. Let's make sure:\n\nCheckered Red requires at least one C and at least one B.\n\nCheckered Brown requires at least one C but no B.\n\nPlain Red requires no C but at least one B.\n\nPlain Brown requires no C and no B.\n\nLooking back at the list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Yes\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n3. CC bb \u2192 No (only B)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n6. Cc bb \u2192 No (only B)\n7. cc BB \u2192 No (only B)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 No (only B)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Yes\n\nWait, no. For example, cc BB would mean both alleles for B are present, but no C. So it's Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, cc Bb would be Checkered Brown.\n\nOnly cc bb would be plain.\n\nSo now, counting:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 3,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n- Plain Brown: None, since all require at least one C, which isn't present here.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (because B is present, but no C)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 3,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Plain: Only case 9 \u2192 1\n- Plain Brown: None \u2192 0\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Checkered Plain : Plain Brown = 4:4:1:0\n\nWait, but none of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options provided.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.2,6,2,6\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\nK.4,4,1,0\n\nFrom our calculation, J says Checkered Red 2, Checkered Brown 6, Checkered Plain 3, Plain Brown 1. That's different from what I calculated. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the dominance rules:\n\n- Checkered (C): dominant over plain (c)\n- Checkered color further divided by B (dominant over b)\n\nSo, a bird with at least one C is red, and within those, if it has a B, it's checkered red; else, it's plain red.\n\nA bird with no C is brown, and within those, if it has a B, it's checkered brown; else, it's plain brown.\n\nSo, checking the genotypes again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c_bb \u2192 Brown, but has B? No, because B is recessive. Wait, no: in cc BB, B is present (as it's dominant), but since c is recessive, it's brown. But since B is present, it's Checkered Brown.\n\nWait, but according to the hierarchy, checkered comes before plain. So, even if a bird has B, it's still red, just less vividly.\n\nSimilarly, if a bird is cc, it's brown regardless of B.\n\nSo, going back to the counts:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Red\n3. Checkered Brown\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Red\n6. Checkered Brown\n7. Brown (from cc BB)\n8. Brown (from cc Bb)\n9. Red (from cc bb)\n\nSo, Checkered Red: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nCheckered Brown: 3,6 \u2192 2\nBrown (but not checkered): 7,8 \u2192 2\nPlain Brown: 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4+2+2+1=9, which doesn't make sense because the total should be 16.\n\nWait, no, because each genotype leads to one phenotype. So:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Red\n3. Checkered Brown\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Red\n6. Checkered Brown\n7. Brown (from cc BB)\n8. Brown (from cc Bb)\n9. Red (from cc bb)\n\nSo, Checkered Red: 4\nCheckered Brown: 2\nBrown: 7,8 \u2192 2 (since cc BB and cc Bb are both brown, but not checkered)\nPlain Brown: 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but 4 + 2 + 2 +1 = 9, which is less than 16. This suggests I'm missing some genotypes.\n\nAh, no. Wait, no: Wait, in the F2, there are 16 possible genotypes, each leading to one phenotype. So my initial breakdown was incorrect.\n\nLet me correctly count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Any genotype where at least one C and at least one B.\n  - 1. CC BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 2. CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n  - 4. Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 5. Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 4\n\n- Checkered Brown: Any genotype where C is present but B is absent.\n  - 3. CC bb \u2192 Yes\n  - 6. Cc bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 2\n\n- Checkered Plain: Any genotype where c is present but B is absent.\n  - 7. cc BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 8. cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 2\n\n- Plain Brown: Any genotype where neither C nor B are present.\n  - 9. cc bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 1\n\nAdding up: 4 + 2 + 2 +1 = 9, but there are 16 genotypes. Where am I missing 7?\n\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nGenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, but according to my previous breakdown, I had:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown: 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Checkered Plain: 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown:9 \u21921\n\nThat totals 9, but there are 16 genotypes. So, I must be making a mistake.\n\nAh! Wait a minute. The initial analysis assumes that the F2 is produced by a selfing of CcBb, but in reality, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So when they mate, they produce CcBb gametes equally, right? So when you selfmate CcBb, you get CcBb x CcBb, resulting in 9 distinct genotypic combinations, each with equal probability.\n\nSo, the 16 genotypic combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n6.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and another that's plain brown. I need to find the phenotypic ratio after an F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down what each parent bird is contributing. The checkered red bird has the genotype CC BB because it's homozygous checkered red. The plain brown bird has cc bb since it's homozygous plain brown.\n\nNow, when they mate, their offspring will be F1. Each F1 bird can have gametes CB, cb, cB, or cb. So there are four possible combinations, making the F1 generation CcBB \u00d7 CcBB? Wait, no, both parents are CC BB and cc bb, but actually, wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe first parent is CC BB, meaning both genes are dominant (checkered red), and the second parent is cc bb, meaning both genes are recessive (plain brown). When these two mate, all the offspring will receive one C from the first parent and one c from the second parent. Similarly, for the B and b alleles, the first parent gives B and the second gives b. So the F1 should all be CcBb. That makes sense because CC BB crossed with cc bb would produce CcBb in all cases.\n\nWait, but the question mentions showing F1 as CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, which suggests that the F1 would be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. But in reality, all the F1 would be CcBb because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F1 would be CcBb for both parents.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. Since F1 is CcBb, the next generation would involve selfing. To determine the F2 phenotypes, I'll use a Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- The C locus: C (dominant) and c (recessive)\n- The B locus: B (dominant) and b (recessive)\n\nEach gene is independent, so I can analyze them separately.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of CC = 25%\n- Probability of Cc = 50%\n- Probability of cc = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Same probabilities apply.\n- So, the Punnett square for each gene will look like:\n\n```\n     C   cc\n    + B   Bb\n    + b   bB\n```\n\nBut more accurately, the F2 would have each gene segregating independently. So combining both loci, we get:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the possible genotypic combinations would include:\n\nCC BB, CC Bb, CC bb,\nCc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb,\ncc BB, cc Bb, cc bb\n\nEach combination will result in different phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Checkered (C) determines if it's red or brown (B).\n- Plain (c) determines if it's red or brown (b).\n\nSo:\n- If C is present, it's red.\n  - If B is present, it's checkered red (C_B_).\n  - If not, it's checkered brown (C_bb).\n- If c is present, it's brown.\n  - If B is present, it's plain brown (bb_b_).\n  - If not, it's plain red (bbbb).\n\nWait, no\u2014wait. The checkered color is determined by the presence of at least one C allele. So any bird with at least one C is red. Then, the B allele determines if it's checkered (B present) or plain (not B).\n\nSimilarly, for brown, any bird with at least one b is brown. The B allele determines checkered (B present) or plain (no B).\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nLet me create a table for each possible genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 bb_b_ \u2192 Bb_b_ \u2192 No C, so brown, but B is present \u2192 Checkered Brown?\nWait, no. If a bird doesn't have C, it's brown, regardless of B. Because the checkered color is determined by having at least one C. So if a bird is cc bb, then it's brown without any C, so it's plain brown?\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\n- Checkered: presence of C allele \u2192 red\n  - Presence of B allele \u2192 checkered red\n  - Absence of B allele \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain: absence of C allele \u2192 brown\n  - Presence of B allele \u2192 plain brown\n  - Absence of B allele \u2192 plain red\n\nSo for each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (red), B (red) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 same as above \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (red), b (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (red), B (red) \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (red), b (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c (brown), B (red) \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c (brown), b (brown) \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap. Let's count how many of each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible genotypes in F2: 16 (since each gene splits into 4 possibilities, so 4x4=16).\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- Checkered Red: Any genotype where at least one C and at least one B. Looking back:\n  - 1. CC BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 2. CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n  - 4. Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 5. Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 4\n\n- Checkered Brown: Genotypes where C is present but b is present (so B is absent).\n  - 3. CC bb \u2192 Yes\n  - 6. Cc bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 2\n\n- Checkered Plain: Genotypes where c is present, but B is absent.\n  - 7. cc BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 8. cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 2\n\n- Plain Brown: Genotypes where neither C nor B are present (all c and b).\n  - 9. cc bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 1\n\nWait, but looking back, I might have miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nCheckered Red: All that have at least one C and at least one B. From the list:\n- 1,2,4,5: 4\n- 3: CC bb \u2192 yes\n- 6: Cc bb \u2192 yes\n- 7: cc BB \u2192 yes\n- 8: cc Bb \u2192 yes\n- 9: cc bb \u2192 yes\n\nWait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Bb_b_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 b_b_b_ \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me approach differently.\n\nEach gene (C and B) segregates independently into 2:1 ratio (C:cc 2:1). So each gene has 2/3 chance of being C and 1/3 chance of being c.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, I'll calculate the number of each phenotype based on the probability.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb:\n\nThe possible genotypic combinations are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nEach of these will produce specific phenotypes.\n\nNow, mapping each genotype to phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, no. Let's make sure:\n\nCheckered Red requires at least one C and at least one B.\n\nCheckered Brown requires at least one C but no B.\n\nPlain Red requires no C but at least one B.\n\nPlain Brown requires no C and no B.\n\nLooking back at the list:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Yes\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n3. CC bb \u2192 No (only B)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n6. Cc bb \u2192 No (only B)\n7. cc BB \u2192 No (only B)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 No (only B)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Yes\n\nWait, no. For example, cc BB would mean both alleles for B are present, but no C. So it's Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, cc Bb would be Checkered Brown.\n\nOnly cc bb would be plain.\n\nSo now, counting:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 3,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n- Plain Brown: None, since all require at least one C, which isn't present here.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (because B is present, but no C)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 3,6,7,8 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Plain: Only case 9 \u2192 1\n- Plain Brown: None \u2192 0\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Checkered Plain : Plain Brown = 4:4:1:0\n\nWait, but none of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options provided.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.2,6,2,6\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\nK.4,4,1,0\n\nFrom our calculation, J says Checkered Red 2, Checkered Brown 6, Checkered Plain 3, Plain Brown 1. That's different from what I calculated. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the dominance rules:\n\n- Checkered (C): dominant over plain (c)\n- Checkered color further divided by B (dominant over b)\n\nSo, a bird with at least one C is red, and within those, if it has a B, it's checkered red; else, it's plain red.\n\nA bird with no C is brown, and within those, if it has a B, it's checkered brown; else, it's plain brown.\n\nSo, checking the genotypes again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c_bb \u2192 Brown, but has B? No, because B is recessive. Wait, no: in cc BB, B is present (as it's dominant), but since c is recessive, it's brown. But since B is present, it's Checkered Brown.\n\nWait, but according to the hierarchy, checkered comes before plain. So, even if a bird has B, it's still red, just less vividly.\n\nSimilarly, if a bird is cc, it's brown regardless of B.\n\nSo, going back to the counts:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Red\n3. Checkered Brown\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Red\n6. Checkered Brown\n7. Brown (from cc BB)\n8. Brown (from cc Bb)\n9. Red (from cc bb)\n\nSo, Checkered Red: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nCheckered Brown: 3,6 \u2192 2\nBrown (but not checkered): 7,8 \u2192 2\nPlain Brown: 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4+2+2+1=9, which doesn't make sense because the total should be 16.\n\nWait, no, because each genotype leads to one phenotype. So:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Red\n3. Checkered Brown\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Red\n6. Checkered Brown\n7. Brown (from cc BB)\n8. Brown (from cc Bb)\n9. Red (from cc bb)\n\nSo, Checkered Red: 4\nCheckered Brown: 2\nBrown: 7,8 \u2192 2 (since cc BB and cc Bb are both brown, but not checkered)\nPlain Brown: 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but 4 + 2 + 2 +1 = 9, which is less than 16. This suggests I'm missing some genotypes.\n\nAh, no. Wait, no: Wait, in the F2, there are 16 possible genotypes, each leading to one phenotype. So my initial breakdown was incorrect.\n\nLet me correctly count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Any genotype where at least one C and at least one B.\n  - 1. CC BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 2. CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n  - 4. Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 5. Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 4\n\n- Checkered Brown: Any genotype where C is present but B is absent.\n  - 3. CC bb \u2192 Yes\n  - 6. Cc bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 2\n\n- Checkered Plain: Any genotype where c is present but B is absent.\n  - 7. cc BB \u2192 Yes\n  - 8. cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 2\n\n- Plain Brown: Any genotype where neither C nor B are present.\n  - 9. cc bb \u2192 Yes\n  Total: 1\n\nAdding up: 4 + 2 + 2 +1 = 9, but there are 16 genotypes. Where am I missing 7?\n\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nGenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, but according to my previous breakdown, I had:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown: 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Checkered Plain: 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown:9 \u21921\n\nThat totals 9, but there are 16 genotypes. So, I must be making a mistake.\n\nAh! Wait a minute. The initial analysis assumes that the F2 is produced by a selfing of CcBb, but in reality, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So when they mate, they produce CcBb gametes equally, right? So when you selfmate CcBb, you get CcBb x CcBb, resulting in 9 distinct genotypic combinations, each with equal probability.\n\nSo, the 16 genotypic combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown:3,6,7,8 \u21924\n- Checkered Plain:9 \u21921\n- Plain Brown: none \u21920\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:4:1:0, which matches option J: Checkered Red 2, Checkered Brown 6, Checkered Plain 3, Plain Brown 1.

    "rollout": " Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question involves a checkered pattern in pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Then there are two traits related to color: red is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by the recessive allele b.\n\nWe have an adihybridcross between a homozygous checkered red bird (so genotype CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to create a Punnett square for the F1 generation and then analyze the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio.\n\nFirst, let's break down the parents:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nSince these are both dihybrids, their offspring will be F1. So, we'll make a Punnett square for CC BB x cc bb.\n\nEach parent can produce gametes as follows:\n- From CC BB: All gametes will be CB because both alleles are dominant.\n- From cc bb: All gametes will be cb because one allele is recessive and the other is dominant.\n\nSo, all F1 individuals will receive one CB gamete from each parent. Therefore, the F1 genotype will be Cc Bb.\n\nNow, looking at the phenotypes based on the genes involved:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant C \u2192 Checkered Pattern (Red or Brown)\n- Gene c: Recessive c \u2192 Plain Color\n- Gene B: Dominant B \u2192 Red Color\n- Gene b: Recessive b \u2192 Brown Color\n\nSo, combining these, the F1 should be:\n\n- If both C and B are present, they'll be Checkered Red.\n- If C is present but not B, they'll be Checkered Plain.\n- If c is present regardless of B, they'll be Plain Brown.\n- If c is present and B is not, they'll be Plain Plain? Wait, no, wait. No, if c is present, it's Plain, regardless of B. Because B controls red, which is dominant over plain.\n\nWait, hold on. The dominance hierarchy is important here. For the color, B is dominant, so any presence of B means red, else brown. Similarly, for the pattern, C is dominant, so any presence of C means checkered, else plain.\n\nBut since both parents contribute one allele each, the F1 will always get one C from Parent 1 and one c from Parent 2. So, C is dominant, so the pattern will always be Checkered. But for the color, each F1 will get either B or b. Since B is dominant, all F1s will be Checkered Red because they have at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, all F1 will be Checkered Red.\n\nMoving to the F2 generation. Since F1 are all Cc BB (wait, no, F1 would actually be Cc Bb, right?) Wait, no, correction: Each F1 individual is Cc (from Cc BB) and Bb (from cc bb), but when crossed, the F2 will have combinations of these.\n\nLet me correct that. The F1 from CC BB x cc bb is Cc Bb. Now, crossing Cc Bb x Cc Bb.\n\nFor the pattern (C and c):\n\n- Each gene is independently inherited, so the possible combinations for each gene are CC, Cc, cc.\n\nSimilarly, for color (B and b):\n\n- Each gene is independently inherited, so the possible combinations for each gene are BB, Bb, bb.\n\nSo, the F2 will have:\n\nPattern: Each gene has 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nColor: Each gene has 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nBut since the patterns and colors are independent, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities.\n\nHowever, the question asks specifically about the phenotypic ratio considering both pattern and color together, perhaps grouped into categories like Checkered Red, etc., and their subcategories.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that the F1 is Cc Bb, when crossed with another Cc Bb, each gene's inheritance is independent.\n\nFor the pattern (C and c):\n\nProbability of each genotype:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor color (B and b):\nProbability of each genotype:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotype depends on both the pattern and the color.\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n\n1.

That doesn't add up to 25%. Alternatively, H: 5,3,2,6 adds up to 16, which isn't matching. Option K: 12,2,2,0 sums to 16 again. Wait, none of these seem to sum to 25%. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. It says \"phenotypic ratio\", which could mean the count rather than percentages. So, let's consider the actual counts instead of proportions.\n\nAssuming the F2 generation has (number of each genotype):\n\nFor each gene, each outcome has 25% chance.\n\nBut since it's a dihybrid cross, the total number of offspring will be 16 (assuming 4x4 grid). However, since each bird is represented once, the actual numbers depend on how many birds are produced.\n\nBut without knowing the exact number, perhaps we're just looking for the ratio among the four phenotypes, ignoring absolute numbers. Or maybe the actual counts are different.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypes based on their combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nIf we assume that each bird is equally likely to be any of the four phenotypes, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But the options suggest otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the combined probability is multiplicative.\n\nFor example, Checkered Red (CC BB): (25% for CC) * (25% for BB) = 6.25%.\n\nBut since each bird is represented once, the actual count might be 1 per bird, leading to 4 birds in total, but the ratio would still be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options don't include equal ratios. Wait, looking back, option J: 2,6,3,1. Sum is 12. That suggests more Checkered Red than others. Option H: 5,3,2,6 sums to 16.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 sums to 16.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 sums to 16.\n\nWait, none of these add up to 25. This suggests I might have misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the same phenotype category, not across all.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on both traits, considering the dominance hierarchies.\n\nWait, for example, if a bird is Checkered Red (CC BB), it would express the dominant B and dominant C. Similarly, Checkered Brown (CC bb) would also be expressed as brown, despite being plain.\n\nBut the question mentions \"checkered pattern\" controlled by C and \"red color\" controlled by B. So, the presence of C leads to Checkered Pattern, and presence of B leads to Red Color. Otherwise, Plain.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, for each bird, its phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Both traits dominant: Checkered Red (C and B present)\n2. Checkered Red with missing B: Still Checkered Red\n3. Checkered Red with missing C: Plain Red\n4. Checkered Red with neither B nor C: Plain Red\n5. Checkered Brown with B: Checkered Brown\n6. Checkered Brown with no C: Plain Brown\n7. Checkered Brown with neither B nor C: Plain Brown\n8. Plain Red with B: Plain Red\n9. Plain Red with no C: Plain Red\n10. Plain Brown with B: Plain Brown\n11. Plain Brown with no C: Plain Brown\n12. Plain Brown with neither B nor C: Plain Brown\n\nThis way, each bird falls into one of these categories.\n\nNow, to find the number of birds in each category, we can use the Punnett square approach.\n\nThe F1 from Cc BB \u00d7 cc bb is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen crossed with another Cc Bb:\n\nEach gene (C and B) segregates independently.\n\nFor the pattern (C and c):\n\nProbability of CC: 25%\nProbability of Cc: 50%\nProbability of cc: 25%\n\nFor the color (B and b):\n\nProbability of BB: 25%\nProbability of Bb: 50%\nProbability of bb: 25%\n\nNow, combining these:\n\nCheckered Red (CC BB): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nCheckered Brown (CC bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPlain Red (cc BB): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPlain Brown (cc bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nBut since each bird is represented once, the actual counts would be:\n\nNumber of Checkered Red: 6.25% of total birds\nNumber of Checkered Brown: 6.25%\nNumber of Plain Red: 6.25%\nNumber of Plain Brown: 6.25%\n\nBut the question provides counts rather than percentages, so assuming a large enough population where the ratios hold approximately.\n\nBut none of the answer choices provide exactly 6.25% for each phenotype. The closest is option J: 2,6,3,1. Which sums to 12. This suggests a ratio of 2:6:3:1, but that's inconsistent with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. It says \"phenotypic ratio,\" which could refer to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to each other. Let's think differently.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypic ratios are based on the combinations of dominant and recessive traits for both color and pattern.\n\nEach bird has a 25% chance of having each specific combination:\n\n- CC (pattern) and BB (color): Checkered Red\n- CC (pattern) and bb (color): Checkered Brown\n- cc (pattern) and BB (color): Plain Red\n- cc (pattern) and bb (color): Plain Brown\n\nSo, each of these four combinations exists, making a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the answer options don't have this. Instead, some options combine multiple phenotypes into categories.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the ratio within each phenotype class, meaning how many of each type of bird there are compared to another within the same phenotype.\n\nFor example, how many Checkered Red birds there are compared to Checkered Brown birds.\n\nBut according to our previous calculation, each phenotype has 25% representation, so the ratio between any two phenotypes would be 1:1.\n\nBut none of the answer options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to the others, grouping similar ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to ignore the dominance and just count the possible combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not among the options. Thus, perhaps the intended answer is based on the fact that the F2 generation will have 9 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, and 1 Plain Brown, totaling 16 birds. But this doesn't fit the dominance hierarchy either.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. The dominance hierarchy affects the actual phenotypes observed, so the counts shouldn't be 9,3,3,1 because of dominance.\n\nPerhaps the question is simplifying and treating each possible combination as a separate phenotype, even though dominance determines the final appearance.\n\nIn that case, each of the four phenotypes would occur 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut again, the answer options don't include this. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something fundamental.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: It asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided do not seem to align with the 25% distribution unless further simplification is done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying the ratio based on the actual number of birds in each phenotype class, not accounting for dominance. In that case, each phenotype would have 25% representation, which again doesn't align with the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, and thus the phenotypic ratio reflects the frequency of each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both traits.\n\nThus, the F2 generation would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, but since the answer options don't include this, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the others, such as the number of Checkered Red compared to Plain Red, etc.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to pick the answer that most closely matches the expected Mendelian ratio, adjusted for dominance.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected F2 phenotypic ratio, considering both traits, would be 9:3:3:1. But this doesn't account for dominance, so each phenotype group would have fewer birds.\n\nWait, no, the 9:3:3:1 refers to the raw counts before considering dominance. When dominance is considered, the phenotypic ratio changes.\n\nActually, in a dihybrid cross where each trait is independently controlled, the phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, but this assumes that both traits are fully expressed, i.e., each bird shows the expression of both traits. However, in reality, due to dominance, certain combinations may not appear.\n\nBut in our case, since both traits are expressed fully, the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but the question specifies that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the red color by B, and vice versa for plain. So, each trait is expressed fully when at least one dominant allele is present.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes remain four: Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown, with equal representation in the F2 generation.\n\nBut since the answer options don't include 1:1:1:1, perhaps the intended answer is based on the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait, which would indeed be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of phenotypes in terms of the presence of dominant alleles for both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, assuming equal distribution, which would lead to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest match to the expected Mendelian ratio after dominance considerations is the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to option K: 12, 2, 2, 0. Wait, no, option K is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, while the correct ratio should",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully.\n\nThe question involves a checkered pattern in pigeons controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Then there are two traits related to color: red is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by the recessive allele b.\n\nWe have an adihybridcross between a homozygous checkered red bird (so genotype CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to create a Punnett square for the F1 generation and then analyze the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio.\n\nFirst, let's break down the parents:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nSince these are both dihybrids, their offspring will be F1. So, we'll make a Punnett square for CC BB x cc bb.\n\nEach parent can produce gametes as follows:\n- From CC BB: All gametes will be CB because both alleles are dominant.\n- From cc bb: All gametes will be cb because one allele is recessive and the other is dominant.\n\nSo, all F1 individuals will receive one CB gamete from each parent. Therefore, the F1 genotype will be Cc Bb.\n\nNow, looking at the phenotypes based on the genes involved:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant C \u2192 Checkered Pattern (Red or Brown)\n- Gene c: Recessive c \u2192 Plain Color\n- Gene B: Dominant B \u2192 Red Color\n- Gene b: Recessive b \u2192 Brown Color\n\nSo, combining these, the F1 should be:\n\n- If both C and B are present, they'll be Checkered Red.\n- If C is present but not B, they'll be Checkered Plain.\n- If c is present regardless of B, they'll be Plain Brown.\n- If c is present and B is not, they'll be Plain Plain? Wait, no, wait. No, if c is present, it's Plain, regardless of B. Because B controls red, which is dominant over plain.\n\nWait, hold on. The dominance hierarchy is important here. For the color, B is dominant, so any presence of B means red, else brown. Similarly, for the pattern, C is dominant, so any presence of C means checkered, else plain.\n\nBut since both parents contribute one allele each, the F1 will always get one C from Parent 1 and one c from Parent 2. So, C is dominant, so the pattern will always be Checkered. But for the color, each F1 will get either B or b. Since B is dominant, all F1s will be Checkered Red because they have at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, all F1 will be Checkered Red.\n\nMoving to the F2 generation. Since F1 are all Cc BB (wait, no, F1 would actually be Cc Bb, right?) Wait, no, correction: Each F1 individual is Cc (from Cc BB) and Bb (from cc bb), but when crossed, the F2 will have combinations of these.\n\nLet me correct that. The F1 from CC BB x cc bb is Cc Bb. Now, crossing Cc Bb x Cc Bb.\n\nFor the pattern (C and c):\n\n- Each gene is independently inherited, so the possible combinations for each gene are CC, Cc, cc.\n\nSimilarly, for color (B and b):\n\n- Each gene is independently inherited, so the possible combinations for each gene are BB, Bb, bb.\n\nSo, the F2 will have:\n\nPattern: Each gene has 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nColor: Each gene has 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nBut since the patterns and colors are independent, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities.\n\nHowever, the question asks specifically about the phenotypic ratio considering both pattern and color together, perhaps grouped into categories like Checkered Red, etc., and their subcategories.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that the F1 is Cc Bb, when crossed with another Cc Bb, each gene's inheritance is independent.\n\nFor the pattern (C and c):\n\nProbability of each genotype:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor color (B and b):\nProbability of each genotype:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotype depends on both the pattern and the color.\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red: Requires CC (pattern) and BB (color).\n2. Checkered Brown: Requires CC (pattern) and bb (color).\n3. Plain Red: Requires cc (pattern) and BB (color).\n4. Plain Brown: Requires cc (pattern) and bb (color).\n\nSo, calculating the proportion for each phenotype:\n\nTotal probability = (probability of each pattern) * (probability of each color).\n\nCheckered Red (CC BB): 25% pattern * 25% color = 6.25% (or 1/16)\nCheckered Brown (CC bb): 25% pattern * 25% color = 6.25% (1/16)\nPlain Red (cc BB): 25% pattern * 25% color = 6.25% (1/16)\nPlain Brown (cc bb): 25% pattern * 25% color = 6.25% (1/16)\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 6.25 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 25%, which makes sense.\n\nBut the options given don't seem to match exactly.

In that case, each phenotype would have 25% representation, which again doesn't align with the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, and thus the phenotypic ratio reflects the frequency of each combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both traits.\n\nThus, the F2 generation would have a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, but since the answer options don't include this, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the others, such as the number of Checkered Red compared to Plain Red, etc.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to pick the answer that most closely matches the expected Mendelian ratio, adjusted for dominance.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected F2 phenotypic ratio, considering both traits, would be 9:3:3:1. But this doesn't account for dominance, so each phenotype group would have fewer birds.\n\nWait, no, the 9:3:3:1 refers to the raw counts before considering dominance. When dominance is considered, the phenotypic ratio changes.\n\nActually, in a dihybrid cross where each trait is independently controlled, the phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, but this assumes that both traits are fully expressed, i.e., each bird shows the expression of both traits. However, in reality, due to dominance, certain combinations may not appear.\n\nBut in our case, since both traits are expressed fully, the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but the question specifies that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the red color by B, and vice versa for plain. So, each trait is expressed fully when at least one dominant allele is present.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes remain four: Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown, with equal representation in the F2 generation.\n\nBut since the answer options don't include 1:1:1:1, perhaps the intended answer is based on the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait, which would indeed be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of phenotypes in terms of the presence of dominant alleles for both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, assuming equal distribution, which would lead to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this is speculative.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest match to the expected Mendelian ratio after dominance considerations is the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to option K: 12, 2, 2, 0. Wait, no, option K is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, while the correct ratio should",

One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are dominant for the pigmentation traits. So their genotype would be CC (since C is the dominant for color). The other parent is a plain brown bird, meaning they're homozygous for the other trait. Their genotype would be bb because b is the recessive allele for color, and since it's brown, it must be homozygous recessive. \n\nWait, but we also have two different traits: one for color (C and B) and another for shape or something else? Oh, no, wait, maybe not. Wait, the user mentioned that the checkered pattern is controlled by gene C, where C is dominant and c is recessive. Plain color is determined by c. Then red is controlled by B, and brown by b. Hmm, perhaps there are four genes involved here: C (color), B (red), b (brown), and another gene for shape or another aspect?\n\nBut wait, looking back at the problem statement, it seems like each bird has two loci. The first bird is CC BB, and the second is cc bb. But the question says the cross is between CCBB and ccbb. Wait, that can't be right because CCBB would mean two separate loci\u2014so let me clarify:\n\nEach bird is diploid and has two loci. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red. So the alleles are CC for the pigmentation gene (C is dominant for color, c recessive). And for the shape gene, if it's red, then B is dominant for red, and b is recessive for brown. Since it's checkered, perhaps both are dominant? Or maybe each locus is independent. Wait, but the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and red by B, while plain color is c, and brown is b. So each bird has two loci: one determining pigment color (C and c), and another determining shape (B and b).\n\nSo, Parent 1: CC BB. That means for the pigment gene, both alleles are C (dominant), so the phenotype is checkered. For the shape gene, both alleles are B (dominant), so it's red. So overall, it's a checkered red bird.\n\nParent 2: cc bb. For the pigment gene, both alleles are c (recessive), so plain color. For the shape gene, both alleles are b (recessive), so brown. So overall, a plain brown bird.\n\nNow, the cross is between these two birds: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nTo find the F1 generation, we need to consider all possible gametes from each parent.\n\nFor Parent 1 (CC BB):\n\n- Since both alleles are dominant, they'll produce gametes: CB and CB (but actually, each allele is present once, so the gamete will be CB regardless of dominance).\n\nFor Parent 2 (cc bb):\n\n- Similarly, each allele is recessive, so the gametes will be cb regardless of dominance.\n\nThus, the F1 cross will result in gametes: CB and cb.\n\nThe F1 genotype combinations when crossed would be CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nSo, the F1 generation is CcBb.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. Since F1 is CcBb, selfing would give us the F2.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would involve the F1 genotypes. Each parent contributes either Cc or Bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so when selfed, the F2 will have combinations of CC, Cc, etc., but considering the two loci separately.\n\nLet me break down the F2 calculation. Each locus is independent, so we can calculate the proportion for each locus separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C and c):\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), the parents are Cc and Cc. When selfed, the probability of C/C is 25%, C/c is 50%, and c/c is 25%. So for pigment, the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered, 50% red, 25% plain.\n\nSimilarly, for the shape gene (B and b):\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), the parents are Bb and Bb. When selfed, the probability of B/B is 25%, B/b is 50%, and b/b is 25%. So the phenotypic ratio is 25% red, 50% brown, 25% plain.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, we multiply the probabilities for each combination.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nCheckered (pigment) \u00d7 Red (shape) = (25% \u00d7 25%) = 6.25%\n\nCheckered \u00d7 Brown = 6.25%\n\nPlain (pigment) \u00d7 Red = (75% \u00d7 25%) = 18.75%\n\nCheckered \u00d7 Brown = same as above \u2192 18.75%\n\nPlain \u00d7 Red = (75% \u00d7 75%) = 56.25%\n\nCheckered \u00d7 Brown = 56.25%\n\nPlain \u00d7 Brown = (75% \u00d7 50%) = 37.5%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, for each combination:\n\n- Pigment Checkered \u00d7 Shape Red: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n- Pigment Checkered \u00d7 Shape Brown: 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%\n- Pigment Plain \u00d7 Shape Red: 75% \u00d7 25% = 18.75%\n- Pigment Plain \u00d7 Shape Brown: 75% \u00d7 50% = 37.5%\n- Pigment Checkered \u00d7 Shape Red: same as above \u2192 6.25%\n- Pigment Checkered \u00d7 Shape Brown: same as above \u2192 12.5%\n- Pigment Plain \u00d7 Shape Red: same as above \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment Plain \u00d7 Shape Brown: same as above \u2192 37.5%\n\nAdding up all these gives 100%.\n\nNow, converting these percentages into actual counts based on the initial cross. The F1 from CCBB \u00d7 ccbb is all CcBb, so all individuals are CcBb. Therefore, the total number of offspring will be 100%, and each category will have its respective percentage.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which might be scaled down. Alternatively, if the total number of eggs is 16, option D fits that.\n\nAlternatively, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16 as well. Wait, but my calculation gave 6.25% checkered red, which is roughly 1 in 16. So perhaps the answer is D or G depending on scaling.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the F2 generation, not the F1. Wait, no, the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, no, the cross is between CCBB (which is checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So the F1 is CcBb. Then the F2 is the next generation after F1 selfing.\n\nTherefore, I think I made a mistake earlier. I was calculating the F2 for the F1 cross, but the question is about the F2 generated by the original cross. So the original parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). The F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the result of F1 selfing.\n\nSo the correct approach is to look at F2 from F1 (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb).\n\nCalculating the F2:\n\nFor pigment gene (C and c):\n\nProbability of C/C: 25%, C/c: 50%, c/c:25%.\n\nFor shape gene (B and b):\n\nSame as pigment, 25% R/R, 50% R/B, 25% B/B.\n\nCombining both, the F2 will have 25% \u00d725% = 6.25% for checkered red, 25%\u00d750% =12.5% checkered brown, 50%\u00d725% =12.5% plain red, 50%\u00d750% =25% plain brown.\n\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 +12.5 +25 = 56%. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014it should add up to 100%.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct way is:\n\nEach combination is (pigment %) \u00d7 (shape %).\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered (pigment) \u00d7 Red (shape): 25% \u00d725% =6.25%\n\nCheckered \u00d7 Brown:25%\u00d750% =12.5%\n\nPlain \u00d7 Red:75%\u00d725% =18.75%\n\nPlain \u00d7 Brown:75%\u00d750% =37.5%\n\nSumming these gives 6.25 +12.5 +18.75 +37.5 = 75%. Wait, that's less than 100%. Did I miss something?\n\nAh, no\u2014I missed the case where both genes are dominant and recessive. Wait, no\u2014that's already covered.\n\nWait, no, the correct breakdown is:\n\nPigment | Shape\n\n25%     25% \u2192 6.25% checkered red\n\n25%     50% \u219212.5% checkered brown\n\n75%     25% \u219218.75% plain red\n\n75%     50% \u219237.5% plain brown\n\nThat adds up to 6.25 +12.5 +18.75 +37.5 = 75%. Wait, still missing 25%. Maybe I'm missing some cases. No, wait\u2014each combination is accounted for. Wait, maybe I added wrong.\n\nWait, 6.25 +12.5 is 18.75, plus 18.75 is 37.5, plus 37.5 is 75. That's only 75%, but it should be 100%. I must have missed some categories.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot the case where both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014wait, for pigment, 25% is dominant, 75% is recessive. For shape, 25% is dominant, 75% recessive. So when both are recessive, it's plain red. Which is 75% \u00d725% =18.75%. Wait, no\u2014if both are recessive, it's plain red, which is 75% \u00d725% =18.75%. Similarly, checkered brown is 25%\u00d750% =12.5%.\n\nWait, now adding all together: 6.25 +12.5 +18.75 +18.75 = 56.25%. Still missing 43.75%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct breakdown should include all four possibilities, including the case where both are recessive. Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the scenario where both genes are recessive. Wait, yes! Because each gene's recessive can occur independently. So, when combining the probabilities, each combination is considered.\n\nWait, let's redo the calculations properly.\n\nPigment (C/c):\n\n- Dominant (C): 25%\n\n- Recessive (c):75%\n\nShape (B/b):\n\n- Dominant (B):25%\n\n- Recessive (b):75%\n\nNow, the four combinations:\n\n1. Pigment Dominant (C) \u00d7 Shape Dominant (B) \u2192 (25% \u00d725%) =6.25% checkered red\n\n2. Pigment Dominant (C) \u00d7 Shape Recessive (b) \u219225%\u00d775% =18.75% checkered brown\n\n3. Pigment Recessive (c) \u00d7 Shape Dominant (B) \u219275%\u00d725% =18.75% plain red\n\n4. Pigment Recessive (c) \u00d7 Shape Recessive (b) \u219275%\u00d775% =56.25% plain brown\n\nAdding these:6.25 +18.75 +18.75 +56.25 =100%. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown =\n\n6.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 56.25\n\nSimplify by multiplying each by 16/16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n6.25 \u00d716 =100\n\n18.75 \u00d716 =300\n\n18.75 \u00d716 =300\n\n56.25 \u00d716 =900\n\nWait, that's overkill. Alternatively, express the ratio without decimals:\n\n6.25 :18.75 :18.75 :56.25\n\nDivide each by 6.25:\n\n1 :3 :3 :9\n\nBecause 6.25 \u00f76.25=1, 18.75\u00f76.25=3, same for the third, and 56.25\u00f76.25=9.\n\nSo the ratio becomes 1 :3 :3 :9.\n\nWhich matches option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Yes, exactly our ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

So overall, a plain brown bird.\n\nNow, the cross is between these two birds: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nTo find the F1 generation, we need to consider all possible gametes from each parent.\n\nFor Parent 1 (CC BB):\n\n- Since both alleles are dominant, they'll produce gametes: CB and CB (but actually, each allele is present once, so the gamete will be CB regardless of dominance).\n\nFor Parent 2 (cc bb):\n\n- Similarly, each allele is recessive, so the gametes will be cb regardless of dominance.\n\nThus, the F1 cross will result in gametes: CB and cb.\n\nThe F1 genotype combinations when crossed would be CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nSo, the F1 generation is CcBb.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation.

Each locus is independent, so we can calculate the proportion for each locus separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C and c):\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), the parents are Cc and Cc. When selfed, the probability of C/C is 25%, C/c is 50%, and c/c is 25%. So for pigment, the phenotypic ratio is 25% checkered, 50% red, 25% plain.\n\nSimilarly, for the shape gene (B and b):\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), the parents are Bb and Bb.

That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which might be scaled down. Alternatively, if the total number of eggs is 16, option D fits that.\n\nAlternatively, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16 as well.

That's only 75%, but it should be 100%. I must have missed some categories.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot the case where both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014wait, for pigment, 25% is dominant, 75% is recessive. For shape, 25% is dominant, 75% recessive. So when both are recessive, it's plain red. Which is 75% \u00d725% =18.75%. Wait, no\u2014if both are recessive, it's plain red, which is 75% \u00d725% =18.75%. Similarly, checkered brown is 25%\u00d750% =12.5%.\n\nWait, now adding all together: 6.25 +12.5 +18.75 +18.75 = 56.25%. Still missing 43.75%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct breakdown should include all four possibilities, including the case where both are recessive. Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the scenario where both genes are recessive. Wait, yes! Because each gene's recessive can occur independently. So, when combining the probabilities, each combination is considered.\n\nWait, let's redo the calculations properly.\n\nPigment (C/c):\n\n- Dominant (C): 25%\n\n- Recessive (c):75%\n\nShape (B/b):\n\n- Dominant (B):25%\n\n- Recessive (b):75%\n\nNow, the four combinations:\n\n1. Pigment Dominant (C) \u00d7 Shape Dominant (B) \u2192 (25% \u00d725%) =6.25% checkered red\n\n2. Pigment Dominant (C) \u00d7 Shape Recessive (b) \u219225%\u00d775% =18.75% checkered brown\n\n3. Pigment Recessive (c) \u00d7 Shape Dominant (B) \u219275%\u00d725% =18.75% plain red\n\n4. Pigment Recessive (c) \u00d7 Shape Recessive (b) \u219275%\u00d775% =56.25% plain brown\n\nAdding these:6.25 +18.75 +18.75 +56.25 =100%. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown =\n\n6.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 56.25\n\nSimplify by multiplying each by 16/16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n6.25 \u00d716 =100\n\n18.75 \u00d716 =300\n\n18.75 \u00d716 =300\n\n56.25 \u00d716 =900\n\nWait, that's overkill. Alternatively, express the ratio without decimals:\n\n6.25 :18.75 :18.75 :56.25\n\nDivide each by 6.25:\n\n1 :3 :3 :9\n\nBecause 6.25 \u00f76.25=1, 18.75\u00f76.25=3, same for the third, and 56.25\u00f76.25=9.\n\nSo the ratio becomes 1 :3 :3 :9.\n\nWhich matches option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Yes, exactly our ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and another that's plain brown. The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation based on their genetic traits.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given. There are two genes involved here: one determining color (B for brown, b for blue, but wait, no\u2014wait, actually, looking back, it says red is B, blue is b? Wait, no\u2014the problem states: red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by a recessive allele b. So, maybe I got that reversed. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n- Checkered pattern: dominant gene C.\n- Plain color: recessive c.\n- Red color: dominant B.\n- Brown color: recessive b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for color: one from each parent. The parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So, the first bird is homozygous for both C (for color) and B (for red), while the second is homozygous for c (for color) and b (for brown).\n\nWhen they have offspring, each bird contributes one allele for each gene. Since the first parent is CCBB, all its gametes will be CB. The second parent is ccbb, which will produce cb gametes. So, the F1 generation should be CcBb because each parent gives one allele for each gene: C from the first parent and c from the second, B from the first, and b from the second.\n\nNow, the next step is to look at the F1 cross, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. To find the F2 generation, we need to consider the selfing of F1. Each F1 individual can produce four types of gametes based on Mendel's laws: CB, Cb, cB, and cb.\n\nThe Punnett square would then show all possible combinations when these gametes combine. However, since we're dealing with two genes, the cross might get a bit complex, but we can approach it by considering each gene separately before combining them.\n\nLet me tackle each gene individually first. For the color gene (B/b):\n\nIn the F1 (CcBb), the proportion of each genotype is as follows:\n- Homozygous dominant (C_B_): 25%\n- Heterozygous (C_b or c_B): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (c_bb): 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the shape gene (B/b):\nIn the F1, the same proportions apply.\n\nBut wait, actually, the F1 is CcBb, so for each gene:\n- For the color gene (B/b): the heterozygotes (C_B and c_b) occur at 50% each, and the homozygotes at 25% each.\n- Same applies to the shape gene (B/b): 50% heterozygotes and 25% homozygotes.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination of these probabilities will give us the F2 phenotypic ratios.\n\nFor the phenotype ratios, we'll consider all possible combinations of the two genes.\n\nEach gene has three possible outcomes: BB, Bb, bb (for the first gene), and similarly for the second gene.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider all possible combinations of the two genes and count how many result in each phenotype.\n\nThe phenotypes depend on the combination of B and b alleles for each gene:\n\n- If both B and b are present (either dominant or recessive), the bird could be red or brown depending on the other gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nActually, the presence of B determines red (dominant) and b determines blue (recessive?), but in our case, the problem states that red is B and brown is b. Wait, no\u2014that seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern: dominant gene C.\n- Plain color: recessive allele c.\n- Red color: dominant gene B.\n- Brown color: recessive allele b.\n\nSo, if an animal has at least one B allele, it will be red, regardless of the other gene. If it doesn't have any B alleles, it will be blue. Similarly for the other gene: if it has at least one b allele, it will be brown; otherwise, it will be blue as well?\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem says brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b, meaning brown is only expressed when the bird has no B alleles. But also, the presence of a b allele means the bird is brown regardless of other factors.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me outline the possible phenotypes based on the presence of B and b:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (so BB or Bb), it will be red.\n- If it has at least one b allele (bb), it will be brown.\n\nBecause the presence of either B or b affects the phenotype. So, the color phenotype depends solely on whether there's at least one dominant (B) or recessive (b) allele.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red (any genotype where at least one B)\n   - BB\n   - Bb\n   - B_B_\n   - etc., but more accurately, any bird with at least one B will be red.\n\n2. Brown (only when the bird has no B alleles, i.e., bb)\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have different proportions based on these rules.\n\nTo find the exact ratio, we can use a Punnett square for each gene and then combine the results.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, we can compute the probabilities for each gene and then multiply them to get the combined probabilities.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each genotype for each gene in the F2 generation.\n\nStarting with the color gene (B/b):\n\nIn the F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at equal frequency (25%).\n\nWhen F1 selfs (self-pollinates), each gamete combines with another randomly selected gamete from the same F1 population.\n\nThe Punnett square for the color gene would look like this:\n\n          | CB | Cb | cB | cb\n        -----------------\n      CB     | C_C_C | C_C_c | C_c_B | C_c_cb\n      Cb     | C_C_C | C_C_c | C_c_B | C_c_cb\n      cB     | C_c_B | C_c_b | cc_B_B | cc_b_b\n      cb     | C_c_B | C_c_b | cc_B_B | cc_b_b\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list all possible combinations without creating a table. Alternatively, think of the possible genotypes and their probabilities.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probability of a particular genotype in F2 is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the color gene (B/b):\n\nProbability of BB = (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\nProbability of Bb = (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/2) = 1/2\nProbability of bb = (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nSame goes for the shape gene (B/b). So, each gene has the same distribution in F2.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the combination of B and b alleles across both genes.\n\nPhenotype possibilities:\n\n1. Both genes contribute B: Bird is red (since at least one B).\n   This includes all cases except when bb is present.\n\n2. At least one gene has b: Bird is brown.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will consist of:\n\n- Red birds: All except those that are homozygous recessive (bb for both genes)\n- Brown birds: Those that are homozygous recessive (bb for both genes)\n\nWait, no\u2014if any gene is b, it's brown. So, the only time a bird is not brown is when both genes are B (i.e., BB or Bb or B_B_), making it red.\n\nThus, the ratio of red to brown in F2 is the complement of the probability of being bb for both genes.\n\nCalculating this:\n\nProbability of being red = 1 - Probability of being bb in both genes\n= 1 - (probability of bb for color gene) * (probability of bb for shape gene)\n= 1 - (1/4 * 1/4)\n= 1 - 1/16\n= 15/16\n\nProbability of being brown = Probability of being bb in both genes\n= 1/16\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't asking for the probability ratio directly; it's asking for the actual phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation.\n\nHowever, since the question provides specific options, perhaps I can instead calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation assuming a large enough population.\n\nAssuming each F1 produces four F2 offspring (if selfing once), but perhaps it's easier to consider the entire F2 generation.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that in F2, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, similar to a dihybrid cross. But adjusted based on dominance.\n\nWait, but the dominance matters here. In this case, the presence of B allows the bird to express red, whereas the presence of b allows it to express brown.\n\nSo, for each bird, if it has at least one B, it's red; else, it's brown.\n\nThis complicates things because it changes the traditional 9:3:3:1 ratio into something else.\n\nInstead, we can calculate the number of red and brown birds based on the possible genotypes.\n\nTotal F2 population: Let's assume 16 individuals for simplicity (each gene has four possibilities, so 4x4=16).\n\nNumber of red birds: All except those who are homozygous recessive in both genes (bb BB, etc.)\n\nNumber of brown birds: Only those who are homozygous recessive in both genes.\n\nSo, calculating:\n\nRed birds:\n\nAll genotypes except bb for both genes.\n\nGenotypes that make them red:\n\n- BB (always red)\n- Bb (red)\n- B_B_ (red)\n- CcB_ (red?)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, in this context, C is irrelevant because the color trait is determined by B and b. The problem doesn't mention C affecting color; it's just a separate gene. So, only B and b matter for color.\n\nWait, the problem says that the color is determined by B and b. So, the presence of B makes it red, and presence of b makes it brown. Therefore, the presence of either B or b in a genotype will result in red or brown, respectively.\n\nSo, in terms of color, red is when there's at least one B, brown when there's none.\n\nThus, the number of red birds is the total minus the number of homozygous recessive (bb) in both genes.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of red and brown birds in the F2.\n\nAssume a class of 16 individuals:\n\n- Number of red birds: Total - number of bb in both genes\n- Number of brown birds: number of bb in both genes\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nProbability of being bb in color gene: 1/4\nProbability of being bb in shape gene: 1/4\nSo, probability of being bb in both genes: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nThus,\n\nNumber of red birds = 16 - (number of individuals with bb in both genes)\nNumber of brown birds = number of individuals with bb in both genes\n\nBut wait, in reality, the number of individuals with bb in both genes is 1/16 of the population, which is 1 in 16. But when considering multiple generations, the actual number depends on the previous generations' breeding patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the F2 generation's actual counts.\n\nIn a typical dihybrid cross (assuming both genes are segregating independently), the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 9:3:3:1 ratio for each possible combination of the two genes.\n\nBut in this case, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird is red or brown, which is determined by having at least one B or at least one b, respectively.\n\nSo, the 9:3:3:1 ratio would translate into:\n\n- 9 cases where the bird is red (all except bb)\n- 3 cases where the bird is red due to B (but not bb)\n- 3 cases where the bird is brown (bb)\n- 1 case where the bird is brown (bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the 9:3:3:1 refers to the four phenotypic categories. But in this case, some of these categories overlap because having at least one B leads to red, and at least one b leads to brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach bird can be classified as:\n\n- Red: If they have at least one B (i.e., not bb for color)\n- Brown: If they have at least one b (i.e., bb for color)\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have:\n\n- Red birds: All except those with bb in both genes\n- Brown birds: Those with bb in both genes\n\nSo, the number of red birds plus the number of brown birds equals the total number of F2 individuals.\n\nFrom the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the breakdown is:\n\n- 9:3:3:1 \u2192 9 parts red (including those with B and bb), 3 parts red due to B, 3 parts brown due to b, and 1 part brown (bb).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that in the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the parts correspond to:\n\n- 9: All red (including those with B and bb)\n- 3: Red due to B (but not bb)\n- 3: Brown due to b (but not bb)\n- 1: Brown (bb)\n\nBut since red includes those with B (whether bb or not), and brown includes those with b (whether bb or not), the 9:3:3:1 corresponds to:\n\n- 9: All red (regardless of bb)\n- 3: Red due to B (without bb)\n- 3: Brown due to b (without bb)\n- 1: Brown (bb)\n\nThus, the total red is 9 + 3 = 12, and brown is 3 + 1 = 4. Wait, that can't be right because 12 + 4 = 16, which matches the total.\n\nBut according to the options provided, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match my current calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Maybe in this case, the presence of B overrides the presence of b, so the order of dominance matters. Or perhaps the reverse.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by B\n- Brown color is controlled by b\n\nWhich implies that B is dominant over b, so having at least one B makes the bird red, and having at least one b makes it brown. Thus, a bird could be red even if it's brown (if it's homozygous for b), but wait\u2014that can't happen because if it's red, it must have at least one B, so it cannot have bb in color.\n\nWait, no, because having at least one B makes it red, and having at least one b makes it brown. So, a bird can be:\n\n- Red: has at least one B (could have bb, but still red)\n- Brown: has at least one b (could have bb, but still brown)\n\nWait, but if a bird has both B and b alleles, it's still red because B is dominant.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because B is dominant, any bird with at least one B will display red, regardless of the other gene.\n\nSimilarly, any bird with at least one b will display brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of B and b, with B taking precedence over b.\n\nSo, the F2 generation's phenotypes are:\n\n- Red birds: Any bird with at least one B allele (so including bb in color)\n- Brown birds: Any bird with at least one b allele (so including bb in shape)\n\nThus, the 9:3:3:1 ratio needs to be applied to these phenotypes.\n\nIn the 9:3:3:1 ratio:\n\n- 9 parts: Red (including those with B and bb)\n- 3 parts: Red (excluding bb)\n- 3 parts: Brown (excluding bb)\n- 1 part: Brown (excluded)\n\nBut wait, the presence of B overrides the presence of b. So, in terms of phenotype:\n\n- All birds with at least one B are red, regardless of the other gene.\n- All birds with at least one b are brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nThus, the phenotype ratio is determined by:\n\n- The number of birds with at least one B\n- The number of birds with at least one b\n\nSince B is dominant, any bird with B is red, and any bird with b is brown. So, the presence of B takes precedence.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation's phenotypes are determined by whether they have at least one B or at least one b. The rest are determined accordingly.\n\nSo, in the 9:3:3:1 ratio:\n\n- 9: All birds with at least one B (red)\n- 3: Birds with at least one B but without bb (red)\n- 3: Birds with at least one b but without bb (brown)\n- 1: Birds with bb (both), thus brown\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct.\n\nBut according to the problem, the answer options don't include this breakdown. Instead, they provide various ratios, such as A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the dominance differently.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement:\n\n- Red color is controlled by B\n- Brown color is controlled by b\n\nPerhaps the problem is implying that B is dominant over b, so having at least one B makes the bird red, and having at least one b makes it brown. So, the presence of B overrides the presence of b.\n\nIn that case, the 9:3:3:1 ratio would translate to:\n\n- 9: All red (including those with B and bb)\n- 3: Red (without bb)\n- 3: Brown (without bb)\n- 1: Brown (without bb)\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the presence of",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and another that's plain brown. The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation based on their genetic traits.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given. There are two genes involved here: one determining color (B for brown, b for blue, but wait, no\u2014wait, actually, looking back, it says red is B, blue is b? Wait, no\u2014the problem states: red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by a recessive allele b. So, maybe I got that reversed. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n- Checkered pattern: dominant gene C.\n- Plain color: recessive c.\n- Red color: dominant B.\n- Brown color: recessive b.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for color: one from each parent. The parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So, the first bird is homozygous for both C (for color) and B (for red), while the second is homozygous for c (for color) and b (for brown).\n\nWhen they have offspring, each bird contributes one allele for each gene. Since the first parent is CCBB, all its gametes will be CB. The second parent is ccbb, which will produce cb gametes. So, the F1 generation should be CcBb because each parent gives one allele for each gene: C from the first parent and c from the second, B from the first, and b from the second.\n\nNow, the next step is to look at the F1 cross, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. To find the F2 generation, we need to consider the selfing of F1. Each F1 individual can produce four types of gametes based on Mendel's laws: CB, Cb, cB, and cb.\n\nThe Punnett square would then show all possible combinations when these gametes combine. However, since we're dealing with two genes, the cross might get a bit complex, but we can approach it by considering each gene separately before combining them.\n\nLet me tackle each gene individually first. For the color gene (B/b):\n\nIn the F1 (CcBb), the proportion of each genotype is as follows:\n- Homozygous dominant (C_B_): 25%\n- Heterozygous (C_b or c_B): 50%\n- Homozygous recessive (c_bb): 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the shape gene (B/b):\nIn the F1, the same proportions apply.\n\nBut wait, actually, the F1 is CcBb, so for each gene:\n- For the color gene (B/b): the heterozygotes (C_B and c_b) occur at 50% each, and the homozygotes at 25% each.\n- Same applies to the shape gene (B/b): 50% heterozygotes and 25% homozygotes.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination of these probabilities will give us the F2 phenotypic ratios.\n\nFor the phenotype ratios, we'll consider all possible combinations of the two genes.\n\nEach gene has three possible outcomes: BB, Bb, bb (for the first gene), and similarly for the second gene.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider all possible combinations of the two genes and count how many result in each phenotype.\n\nThe phenotypes depend on the combination of B and b alleles for each gene:\n\n- If both B and b are present (either dominant or recessive), the bird could be red or brown depending on the other gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nActually, the presence of B determines red (dominant) and b determines blue (recessive?), but in our case, the problem states that red is B and brown is b. Wait, no\u2014that seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered pattern: dominant gene C.\n- Plain color: recessive allele c.\n- Red color: dominant gene B.\n- Brown color: recessive allele b.\n\nSo, if an animal has at least one B allele, it will be red, regardless of the other gene. If it doesn't have any B alleles, it will be blue. Similarly for the other gene: if it has at least one b allele, it will be brown; otherwise, it will be blue as well?\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem says brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b, meaning brown is only expressed when the bird has no B alleles. But also, the presence of a b allele means the bird is brown regardless of other factors.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me outline the possible phenotypes based on the presence of B and b:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (so BB or Bb), it will be red.\n- If it has at least one b allele (bb), it will be brown.\n\nBecause the presence of either B or b affects the phenotype. So, the color phenotype depends solely on whether there's at least one dominant (B) or recessive (b) allele.\n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red (any genotype where at least one B)\n   - BB\n   - Bb\n   - B_B_\n   - etc., but more accurately, any bird with at least one B will be red.\n\n2. Brown (only when the bird has no B alleles, i.e., bb)\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have different proportions based on these rules.\n\nTo find the exact ratio, we can use a Punnett square for each gene and then combine the results.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, we can compute the probabilities for each gene and then multiply them to get the combined probabilities.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each genotype for each gene in the F2 generation.\n\nStarting with the color gene (B/b):\n\nIn the F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at equal frequency (25%).\n\nWhen F1 selfs (self-pollinates), each gamete combines with another randomly selected gamete from the same F1 population.\n\nThe Punnett square for the color gene would look like this:\n\n          | CB | Cb | cB | cb\n        -----------------\n      CB     | C_C_C | C_C_c | C_c_B | C_c_cb\n      Cb     | C_C_C | C_C_c | C_c_B | C_c_cb\n      cB     | C_c_B | C_c_b | cc_B_B | cc_b_b\n      cb     | C_c_B | C_c_b | cc_B_B | cc_b_b\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list all possible combinations without creating a table. Alternatively, think of the possible genotypes and their probabilities.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probability of a particular genotype in F2 is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the color gene (B/b):\n\nProbability of BB = (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\nProbability of Bb = (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/2) = 1/2\nProbability of bb = (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nSame goes for the shape gene (B/b). So, each gene has the same distribution in F2.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the combination of B and b alleles across both genes.\n\nPhenotype possibilities:\n\n1. Both genes contribute B: Bird is red (since at least one B).\n   This includes all cases except when bb is present.\n\n2. At least one gene has b: Bird is brown.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will consist of:\n\n- Red birds: All except those that are homozygous recessive (bb for both genes)\n- Brown birds: Those that are homozygous recessive (bb for both genes)\n\nWait, no\u2014if any gene is b, it's brown. So, the only time a bird is not brown is when both genes are B (i.e., BB or Bb or B_B_), making it red.\n\nThus, the ratio of red to brown in F2 is the complement of the probability of being bb for both genes.\n\nCalculating this:\n\nProbability of being red = 1 - Probability of being bb in both genes\n= 1 - (probability of bb for color gene) * (probability of bb for shape gene)\n= 1 - (1/4 * 1/4)\n= 1 - 1/16\n= 15/16\n\nProbability of being brown = Probability of being bb in both genes\n= 1/16\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't asking for the probability ratio directly; it's asking for the actual phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation.\n\nHowever, since the question provides specific options, perhaps I can instead calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation assuming a large enough population.\n\nAssuming each F1 produces four F2 offspring (if selfing once), but perhaps it's easier to consider the entire F2 generation.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that in F2, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, similar to a dihybrid cross. But adjusted based on dominance.\n\nWait, but the dominance matters here. In this case, the presence of B allows the bird to express red, whereas the presence of b allows it to express brown.\n\nSo, for each bird, if it has at least one B, it's red; else, it's brown.\n\nThis complicates things because it changes the traditional 9:3:3:1 ratio into something else.\n\nInstead, we can calculate the number of red and brown birds based on the possible genotypes.\n\nTotal F2 population: Let's assume 16 individuals for simplicity (each gene has four possibilities, so 4x4=16).\n\nNumber of red birds: All except those who are homozygous recessive in both genes (bb BB, etc.)\n\nNumber of brown birds: Only those who are homozygous recessive in both genes.\n\nSo, calculating:\n\nRed birds:\n\nAll genotypes except bb for both genes.\n\nGenotypes that make them red:\n\n- BB (always red)\n- Bb (red)\n- B_B_ (red)\n- CcB_ (red?)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, in this context, C is irrelevant because the color trait is determined by B and b. The problem doesn't mention C affecting color; it's just a separate gene. So, only B and b matter for color.\n\nWait, the problem says that the color is determined by B and b. So, the presence of B makes it red, and presence of b makes it brown. Therefore, the presence of either B or b in a genotype will result in red or brown, respectively.\n\nSo, in terms of color, red is when there's at least one B, brown when there's none.\n\nThus, the number of red birds is the total minus the number of homozygous recessive (bb) in both genes.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of red and brown birds in the F2.\n\nAssume a class of 16 individuals:\n\n- Number of red birds: Total - number of bb in both genes\n- Number of brown birds: number of bb in both genes\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nProbability of being bb in color gene: 1/4\nProbability of being bb in shape gene: 1/4\nSo, probability of being bb in both genes: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nThus,\n\nNumber of red birds = 16 - (number of individuals with bb in both genes)\nNumber of brown birds = number of individuals with bb in both genes\n\nBut wait, in reality, the number of individuals with bb in both genes is 1/16 of the population, which is 1 in 16. But when considering multiple generations, the actual number depends on the previous generations' breeding patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the F2 generation's actual counts.\n\nIn a typical dihybrid cross (assuming both genes are segregating independently), the F2 generation would have:\n\n- 9:3:3:1 ratio for each possible combination of the two genes.\n\nBut in this case, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird is red or brown, which is determined by having at least one B or at least one b, respectively.\n\nSo, the 9:3:3:1 ratio would translate into:\n\n- 9 cases where the bird is red (all except bb)\n- 3 cases where the bird is red due to B (but not bb)\n- 3 cases where the bird is brown (bb)\n- 1 case where the bird is brown (bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the 9:3:3:1 refers to the four phenotypic categories. But in this case, some of these categories overlap because having at least one B leads to red, and at least one b leads to brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach bird can be classified as:\n\n- Red: If they have at least one B (i.e., not bb for color)\n- Brown: If they have at least one b (i.e., bb for color)\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have:\n\n- Red birds: All except those with bb in both genes\n- Brown birds: Those with bb in both genes\n\nSo, the number of red birds plus the number of brown birds equals the total number of F2 individuals.\n\nFrom the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the breakdown is:\n\n- 9:3:3:1 \u2192 9 parts red (including those with B and bb), 3 parts red due to B, 3 parts brown due to b, and 1 part brown (bb).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that in the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the parts correspond to:\n\n- 9: All red (including those with B and bb)\n- 3: Red due to B (but not bb)\n- 3: Brown due to b (but not bb)\n- 1: Brown (bb)\n\nBut since red includes those with B (whether bb or not), and brown includes those with b (whether bb or not), the 9:3:3:1 corresponds to:\n\n- 9: All red (regardless of bb)\n- 3: Red due to B (without bb)\n- 3: Brown due to b (without bb)\n- 1: Brown (bb)\n\nThus, the total red is 9 + 3 = 12, and brown is 3 + 1 = 4. Wait, that can't be right because 12 + 4 = 16, which matches the total.\n\nBut according to the options provided, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match my current calculation. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Maybe in this case, the presence of B overrides the presence of b, so the order of dominance matters. Or perhaps the reverse.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by B\n- Brown color is controlled by b\n\nWhich implies that B is dominant over b, so having at least one B makes the bird red, and having at least one b makes it brown. Thus, a bird could be red even if it's brown (if it's homozygous for b), but wait\u2014that can't happen because if it's red, it must have at least one B, so it cannot have bb in color.\n\nWait, no, because having at least one B makes it red, and having at least one b makes it brown. So, a bird can be:\n\n- Red: has at least one B (could have bb, but still red)\n- Brown: has at least one b (could have bb, but still brown)\n\nWait, but if a bird has both B and b alleles, it's still red because B is dominant.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because B is dominant, any bird with at least one B will display red, regardless of the other gene.\n\nSimilarly, any bird with at least one b will display brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of B and b, with B taking precedence over b.\n\nSo, the F2 generation's phenotypes are:\n\n- Red birds: Any bird with at least one B allele (so including bb in color)\n- Brown birds: Any bird with at least one b allele (so including bb in shape)\n\nThus, the 9:3:3:1 ratio needs to be applied to these phenotypes.\n\nIn the 9:3:3:1 ratio:\n\n- 9 parts: Red (including those with B and bb)\n- 3 parts: Red (excluding bb)\n- 3 parts: Brown (excluding bb)\n- 1 part: Brown (excluded)\n\nBut wait, the presence of B overrides the presence of b. So, in terms of phenotype:\n\n- All birds with at least one B are red, regardless of the other gene.\n- All birds with at least one b are brown, regardless of the other gene.\n\nThus, the phenotype ratio is determined by:\n\n- The number of birds with at least one B\n- The number of birds with at least one b\n\nSince B is dominant, any bird with B is red, and any bird with b is brown. So, the presence of B takes precedence.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation's phenotypes are determined by whether they have at least one B or at least one b. The rest are determined accordingly.\n\nSo, in the 9:3:3:1 ratio:\n\n- 9: All birds with at least one B (red)\n- 3: Birds with at least one B but without bb (red)\n- 3: Birds with at least one b but without bb (brown)\n- 1: Birds with bb (both), thus brown\n\nWait, but that doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct.\n\nBut according to the problem, the answer options don't include this breakdown. Instead, they provide various ratios, such as A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the dominance differently.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement:\n\n- Red color is controlled by B\n- Brown color is controlled by b\n\nPerhaps the problem is implying that B is dominant over b, so having at least one B makes the bird red, and having at least one b makes it brown. So, the presence of B overrides the presence of b.\n\nIn that case, the 9:3:3:1 ratio would translate to:\n\n- 9: All red (including those with B and bb)\n- 3: Red (without bb)\n- 3: Brown (without bb)\n- 1: Brown (without bb)\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the presence of",

We need to create a Punnett square for their F2 generation and determine the phenotypic ratio based on the given options.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information:\n\n- Gene C controls checkered and plain colors. C is dominant, c is recessive.\n- Gene B determines red or brown. B is dominant, b is recessive.\n- So, the checkered pattern is from the C locus, and the color is from the B locus.\n\nThe parents are:\n\n1. Homozygous checkered red: CC BB (so both C and B are present).\n2. Plain brown: cc bb (both c and b are recessive).\n\nSo when they breed, we're looking at an F1 generation first, but since the question is about the F2 generation after another cross, maybe I should think about that. Wait, no\u2014the initial setup says \"adahybridcross\", which might be a typo and refers to F1 generation. But the user provided gametes and a Punnett square, so perhaps they want us to use the F1 results to create an F2 cross? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, actually, the problem asks for the F2 generation. So maybe the initial cross was between F1 and F1, but perhaps the question is about a dihybrid cross between two F1s. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the question specifically mentions the F2 generation without any prior crosses except for the starting point.\n\nLet me clarify the steps needed:\n\n1. Determine the possible offspring from the parents (which would give F1).\n2. Then, consider the cross of these F1s to get F2.\n\nBut wait, the question starts with a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be the combination of each parent's alleles.\n\nFor the F1 generation, each parent contributes one allele for C and one for B. Since the first parent is CC (for C) and BB (for B), all its gametes will be CB. Similarly, the second parent is cc (for C) and bb (for B), so all gametes will be cb.\n\nSo the F1 would be all CcBb. Now, if we cross F1 x F1, we'll get F2. The F2 can be determined using a Punnett square with four F1 individuals.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb. When crossed, the possible gametes are:\n\n- For C (dominant): C or c\n- For B (dominant): B or b\n\nSo the gametes would be:\n\n- C B\n- C b\n- c B\n- c b\n\nNow, creating the Punnett square:\n\n```\n          C    c\n        +----+----+\n        C | CC | Cc |\n        b | Cb | cc |\n        B | CB | Cb |\n        b | BC | Bb |\n```\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all combinations:\n\n- F1 x F1 = F2\n\nEach F1 has genotype CcBb. So when crossed, the possible offspring genotypes are combinations where each gene is independently inherited from either parent.\n\nFor each gene, the possible alleles are C/c and B/b.\n\nSo for C:\n- Parent 1 contributes C\n- Parent 2 contributes c\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Parent 1 contributes B\n- Parent 2 contributes b\n\nThus, the possible gametes for each gene are:\n\n- C_B_, C_bb, c_B_, c_bb\n\nWait, more accurately, each gamete combines one allele from each gene.\n\nSo for C:\n- From parent 1: C\n- From parent 2: c\n\nSo gametes for C are C and c.\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n- From parent 1: B\n- From parent 2: b\n\nGametes for B are B and b.\n\nTherefore, each F1 can produce gametes that combine C and B alleles.\n\nNow, when you cross two F1 individuals, each contributing one gamete, the possible combinations are:\n\n- C (from first F1) + B (from second F1) \u2192 C_B_\n- C + b \u2192 C_b_\n- c + B \u2192 c_B_\n- c + b \u2192 c_b_\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- C_C_B_B (all C and B)\n- C_C_bb (C and b)\n- c_c_B_B (c and B)\n- c_c_bb (c and b)\n\nNow, considering dominance:\n\n- For C: C_ (at least one C) is dominant over c_.\n- For B: B_ (at least one B) is dominant over b_.\n\nSo phenotypes depend on whether both C and B are present, or just one.\n\nLooking at the phenotypes:\n\n- If both C and B are present: Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant, so the color is red).\n- If only C is present: Checkered brown (since B is recessive, so color is brown).\n- If only B is present: Plain red (since C is recessive, so color is plain).\n- If neither C nor B is present: Plain brown? Wait, no\u2014if neither is present, then both genes are recessive. So both C and B are absent, meaning both are recessive. So the color would be plain.\n\nWait, but in the F2, how many of each phenotype?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- All C_C_B_B: Checkered red (because C and B are present)\n- All C_C_bb: Checkered brown\n- All c_c_B_B: Plain red\n- All c_c_bb: Plain brown\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\nFor C:\n\n- Probability of having at least one C: 1/2 (either C or c from F1)\n- Same for B: 1/2\n\nSo:\n\n- Both C and B present: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Only C: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Only B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain red\n- Neither C nor B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that adds up to 1. So the proportions would be 25% each for each phenotype.\n\nWait, but the F2 generation is typically 1:1:1:1, so each phenotype would occur equally likely.\n\nBut let me confirm by calculating the actual counts.\n\nAssuming each F1 produces 4 gametes equally, the Punnett square would result in equal distribution among the four genotypes.\n\nHowever, considering dominance, the number of each phenotype depends on the combination of alleles.\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 can produce gametes with either C or c and B or b. So when crossed, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- C_C_B_B\n- C_C_bb\n- c_c_B_B\n- c_c_bb\n\nEach of these occurs in a certain proportion.\n\nGiven that each parent is heterozygous (CcBb), the F1 would produce gametes in the ratio 1:1 for each gene.\n\nWhen crossed, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% C_C_B_B (Checkered red)\n- 25% C_C_bb (Checkered brown)\n- 25% c_c_B_B (Plain red)\n- 25% c_c_bb (Plain brown)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you cross two heterozygotes, the F2 has 25% for each genotype, but considering dominance, some may express differently.\n\nWait, no\u2014that applies to the underlying traits. So in terms of phenotypes, each of these four genotypes would lead to different phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo in F2:\n\n- 25% Checkered red (C_B_)\n- 25% Checkered brown (C_bb)\n- 25% Plain red (c_B_)\n- 25% Plain brown (c_bb)\n\nBecause:\n\n- For Checkered red, both C and B must be present (C_B_)\n- For Checkered brown, only C is present (C_bb)\n- For Plain red, only B is present (c_B_)\n- For Plain brown, neither C nor B is present (c_bb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, with each phenotype occurring equally often.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H don't seem to match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents.\n\nWait, the problem states the parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 x F1 gives F2. Each F1 is CcBb, so when crossed, the F2 genotypes are as I calculated before.\n\nBut according to standard Mendelian ratios, F2 would have 25% each for the four genotypes, leading to four phenotypes each at 25%.\n\nHowever, the options provided suggest different ratios. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1. That totals 12, which is double what I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the numbers. Let me try another approach.\n\nIf we consider that the F1 is CcBb, then when crossed with itself, the possible gametes are C B, C b, c B, c b, each with 25% chance.\n\nSo F2 would consist of all combinations of these gametes.\n\nEach F2 individual has a genotype determined by the combination of gametes from each parent.\n\nSo for example, a genotype like C B would come from a C gamete and a B gamete.\n\nBut when considering dominance, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant.\n\nSo for each genotype in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: C B (both dominant)\n- Checkered brown: C b (only C dominant)\n- Plain red: c B (only B recessive)\n- Plain brown: c b (none dominant)\n\nNow, the proportion of each phenotype is based on the probability of each gamete combination.\n\nEach parent contributes gametes in the ratio 1:1 for each allele.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- C C : (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C c : (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c C : same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c c : (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain red\n- c C : same as above \u2192 Plain brown\n- c c : same as above \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Instead, the correct way is to recognize that in F2, each gene is independently assorting, so the probabilities multiply.\n\nThus:\n\n- For C:\n  - Dominant (C_) = 3/4\n  - Recessive (cc) = 1/4\n- For B:\n  - Dominant (B_) = 3/4\n  - Recessive (bb) = 1/4\n\nBut the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both genes:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Only C dominant: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Only B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- Neither dominant: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding these up:\n\n9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nWhich corresponds to 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, Checkered brown 4, Plain red 4, Plain brown 4. That's 16 total, which isn't correct because it sums to 16, but our calculation shows 16 parts where 9 +3 +3 +1=16.\n\nWait, my previous analysis seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if each F2 individual has a genotype determined by the combination of the gametes from each parent, then the probabilities are as follows:\n\nEach parent contributes either C or c for each gene, and B or b for each gene.\n\nSo for each gene, there's a 50% chance of C or c, and 50% chance of B or b.\n\nThus, for the C gene:\n\n- Dominant (C_) = 3/4\n- Recessive (cc) = 1/4\n\nSame for the B gene.\n\nBut the phenotypes are combinations of both genes:\n\n- Both dominant: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Only C dominant: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Only B dominant: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- Neither dominant: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut none of the options directly state this. Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about F1 instead of F2. Because the initial description was about a checkered pattern and a color, implying F1.\n\nBut the user mentioned \"adahybridcross\" and \"F2 generation,\" which might mean F1 is already crossed.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. It says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the F1 would be Cc for the C locus and cc for the B locus, making it CcBc.\n\nWait, hold on. The parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So their F1 would be CC BB crossed with cc bb.\n\nWhen you cross CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) with cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes), all offspring would be CcBb (heterozygous for both genes).\n\nSo F1 genotypes: all CcBb.\n\nThen, to find F2, we cross F1 x F1.\n\nAs previously, F2 genotypes would be C_C_B_B (25%), C_C_bb (25%), c_c_B_B (25%), c_c_bb (25%).\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered red (dominant for both C and B)\n- C_bb: Checkered brown\n- c_B_: Plain red\n- c_bb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, leading to 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense because 12+2+2+0=16, but our expected sum is also 16, but 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So CCBB is homozygous dominant for both genes, while ccbb is homozygous recessive.\n\nCrossing them would give F1 as CcBc (since each parent contributes C and B for the dominant alleles and c and c for the recessive ones).\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each parent is CCBB and ccbb.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 genotype for C: CC, for B: BB\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 genotype for C: cc, for B: bb\n\nF1 would inherit CC from the first parent and cc from the second, so for C: Cc (since C from the first and c from the second). Similarly, for B: B from the first and b from the second, so Bb.\n\nWait, but the parents are CCBB and ccbb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can contribute C or c for the first gene, and B or b for the second.\n\nSo F1 genotypes: all CcBb.\n\nThen F2 would be crossed as F1 x F1.\n\nThus, F2 would have:\n\n- C_C_B_B (25%)\n- C_C_bb (25%)\n- c_c_B_B (25%)\n- c_c_bb (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nSumming to 100%, with each phenotype occurring once.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown bird (ccbb). We need to create a Punnett square for their F2 generation and determine the phenotypic ratio based on the given options.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information:\n\n- Gene C controls checkered and plain colors. C is dominant, c is recessive.\n- Gene B determines red or brown. B is dominant, b is recessive.\n- So, the checkered pattern is from the C locus, and the color is from the B locus.\n\nThe parents are:\n\n1. Homozygous checkered red: CC BB (so both C and B are present).\n2. Plain brown: cc bb (both c and b are recessive).\n\nSo when they breed, we're looking at an F1 generation first, but since the question is about the F2 generation after another cross, maybe I should think about that. Wait, no\u2014the initial setup says \"adahybridcross\", which might be a typo and refers to F1 generation. But the user provided gametes and a Punnett square, so perhaps they want us to use the F1 results to create an F2 cross? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, actually, the problem asks for the F2 generation. So maybe the initial cross was between F1 and F1, but perhaps the question is about a dihybrid cross between two F1s. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the question specifically mentions the F2 generation without any prior crosses except for the starting point.\n\nLet me clarify the steps needed:\n\n1. Determine the possible offspring from the parents (which would give F1).\n2. Then, consider the cross of these F1s to get F2.\n\nBut wait, the question starts with a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be the combination of each parent's alleles.\n\nFor the F1 generation, each parent contributes one allele for C and one for B. Since the first parent is CC (for C) and BB (for B), all its gametes will be CB. Similarly, the second parent is cc (for C) and bb (for B), so all gametes will be cb.\n\nSo the F1 would be all CcBb. Now, if we cross F1 x F1, we'll get F2. The F2 can be determined using a Punnett square with four F1 individuals.\n\nEach F1 individual is CcBb. When crossed, the possible gametes are:\n\n- For C (dominant): C or c\n- For B (dominant): B or b\n\nSo the gametes would be:\n\n- C B\n- C b\n- c B\n- c b\n\nNow, creating the Punnett square:\n\n```\n          C    c\n        +----+----+\n        C | CC | Cc |\n        b | Cb | cc |\n        B | CB | Cb |\n        b | BC | Bb |\n```\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all combinations:\n\n- F1 x F1 = F2\n\nEach F1 has genotype CcBb. So when crossed, the possible offspring genotypes are combinations where each gene is independently inherited from either parent.\n\nFor each gene, the possible alleles are C/c and B/b.\n\nSo for C:\n- Parent 1 contributes C\n- Parent 2 contributes c\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Parent 1 contributes B\n- Parent 2 contributes b\n\nThus, the possible gametes for each gene are:\n\n- C_B_, C_bb, c_B_, c_bb\n\nWait, more accurately, each gamete combines one allele from each gene.\n\nSo for C:\n- From parent 1: C\n- From parent 2: c\n\nSo gametes for C are C and c.\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n- From parent 1: B\n- From parent 2: b\n\nGametes for B are B and b.\n\nTherefore, each F1 can produce gametes that combine C and B alleles.\n\nNow, when you cross two F1 individuals, each contributing one gamete, the possible combinations are:\n\n- C (from first F1) + B (from second F1) \u2192 C_B_\n- C + b \u2192 C_b_\n- c + B \u2192 c_B_\n- c + b \u2192 c_b_\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- C_C_B_B (all C and B)\n- C_C_bb (C and b)\n- c_c_B_B (c and B)\n- c_c_bb (c and b)\n\nNow, considering dominance:\n\n- For C: C_ (at least one C) is dominant over c_.\n- For B: B_ (at least one B) is dominant over b_.\n\nSo phenotypes depend on whether both C and B are present, or just one.\n\nLooking at the phenotypes:\n\n- If both C and B are present: Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant, so the color is red).\n- If only C is present: Checkered brown (since B is recessive, so color is brown).\n- If only B is present: Plain red (since C is recessive, so color is plain).\n- If neither C nor B is present: Plain brown? Wait, no\u2014if neither is present, then both genes are recessive. So both C and B are absent, meaning both are recessive. So the color would be plain.\n\nWait, but in the F2, how many of each phenotype?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- All C_C_B_B: Checkered red (because C and B are present)\n- All C_C_bb: Checkered brown\n- All c_c_B_B: Plain red\n- All c_c_bb: Plain brown\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\nFor C:\n\n- Probability of having at least one C: 1/2 (either C or c from F1)\n- Same for B: 1/2\n\nSo:\n\n- Both C and B present: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Only C: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Only B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain red\n- Neither C nor B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that adds up to 1. So the proportions would be 25% each for each phenotype.\n\nWait, but the F2 generation is typically 1:1:1:1, so each phenotype would occur equally likely.\n\nBut let me confirm by calculating the actual counts.\n\nAssuming each F1 produces 4 gametes equally, the Punnett square would result in equal distribution among the four genotypes.\n\nHowever, considering dominance, the number of each phenotype depends on the combination of alleles.\n\nWait, no\u2014each F1 can produce gametes with either C or c and B or b. So when crossed, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- C_C_B_B\n- C_C_bb\n- c_c_B_B\n- c_c_bb\n\nEach of these occurs in a certain proportion.\n\nGiven that each parent is heterozygous (CcBb), the F1 would produce gametes in the ratio 1:1 for each gene.\n\nWhen crossed, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% C_C_B_B (Checkered red)\n- 25% C_C_bb (Checkered brown)\n- 25% c_c_B_B (Plain red)\n- 25% c_c_bb (Plain brown)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you cross two heterozygotes, the F2 has 25% for each genotype, but considering dominance, some may express differently.\n\nWait, no\u2014that applies to the underlying traits. So in terms of phenotypes, each of these four genotypes would lead to different phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo in F2:\n\n- 25% Checkered red (C_B_)\n- 25% Checkered brown (C_bb)\n- 25% Plain red (c_B_)\n- 25% Plain brown (c_bb)\n\nBecause:\n\n- For Checkered red, both C and B must be present (C_B_)\n- For Checkered brown, only C is present (C_bb)\n- For Plain red, only B is present (c_B_)\n- For Plain brown, neither C nor B is present (c_bb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, with each phenotype occurring equally often.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H don't seem to match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents.\n\nWait, the problem states the parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 x F1 gives F2. Each F1 is CcBb, so when crossed, the F2 genotypes are as I calculated before.\n\nBut according to standard Mendelian ratios, F2 would have 25% each for the four genotypes, leading to four phenotypes each at 25%.\n\nHowever, the options provided suggest different ratios. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1. That totals 12, which is double what I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the numbers. Let me try another approach.\n\nIf we consider that the F1 is CcBb, then when crossed with itself, the possible gametes are C B, C b, c B, c b, each with 25% chance.\n\nSo F2 would consist of all combinations of these gametes.\n\nEach F2 individual has a genotype determined by the combination of gametes from each parent.\n\nSo for example, a genotype like C B would come from a C gamete and a B gamete.\n\nBut when considering dominance, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant.\n\nSo for each genotype in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: C B (both dominant)\n- Checkered brown: C b (only C dominant)\n- Plain red: c B (only B recessive)\n- Plain brown: c b (none dominant)\n\nNow, the proportion of each phenotype is based on the probability of each gamete combination.\n\nEach parent contributes gametes in the ratio 1:1 for each allele.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- C C : (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C c : (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c C : same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c c : (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain red\n- c C : same as above \u2192 Plain brown\n- c c : same as above \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Instead, the correct way is to recognize that in F2, each gene is independently assorting, so the probabilities multiply.\n\nThus:\n\n- For C:\n  - Dominant (C_) = 3/4\n  - Recessive (cc) = 1/4\n- For B:\n  - Dominant (B_) = 3/4\n  - Recessive (bb) = 1/4\n\nBut the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both genes:\n\n- Both C and B dominant: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Only C dominant: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Only B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- Neither dominant: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding these up:\n\n9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nWhich corresponds to 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, Checkered brown 4, Plain red 4, Plain brown 4. That's 16 total, which isn't correct because it sums to 16, but our calculation shows 16 parts where 9 +3 +3 +1=16.\n\nWait, my previous analysis seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if each F2 individual has a genotype determined by the combination of the gametes from each parent, then the probabilities are as follows:\n\nEach parent contributes either C or c for each gene, and B or b for each gene.\n\nSo for each gene, there's a 50% chance of C or c, and 50% chance of B or b.\n\nThus, for the C gene:\n\n- Dominant (C_) = 3/4\n- Recessive (cc) = 1/4\n\nSame for the B gene.\n\nBut the phenotypes are combinations of both genes:\n\n- Both dominant: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- Only C dominant: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Only B dominant: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- Neither dominant: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut none of the options directly state this. Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about F1 instead of F2. Because the initial description was about a checkered pattern and a color, implying F1.\n\nBut the user mentioned \"adahybridcross\" and \"F2 generation,\" which might mean F1 is already crossed.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. It says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the F1 would be Cc for the C locus and cc for the B locus, making it CcBc.\n\nWait, hold on. The parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So their F1 would be CC BB crossed with cc bb.\n\nWhen you cross CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) with cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes), all offspring would be CcBb (heterozygous for both genes).\n\nSo F1 genotypes: all CcBb.\n\nThen, to find F2, we cross F1 x F1.\n\nAs previously, F2 genotypes would be C_C_B_B (25%), C_C_bb (25%), c_c_B_B (25%), c_c_bb (25%).\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered red (dominant for both C and B)\n- C_bb: Checkered brown\n- c_B_: Plain red\n- c_bb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25% each, leading to 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which doesn't make sense because 12+2+2+0=16, but our expected sum is also 16, but 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So CCBB is homozygous dominant for both genes, while ccbb is homozygous recessive.\n\nCrossing them would give F1 as CcBc (since each parent contributes C and B for the dominant alleles and c and c for the recessive ones).\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each parent is CCBB and ccbb.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 genotype for C: CC, for B: BB\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 genotype for C: cc, for B: bb\n\nF1 would inherit CC from the first parent and cc from the second, so for C: Cc (since C from the first and c from the second). Similarly, for B: B from the first and b from the second, so Bb.\n\nWait, but the parents are CCBB and ccbb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can contribute C or c for the first gene, and B or b for the second.\n\nSo F1 genotypes: all CcBb.\n\nThen F2 would be crossed as F1 x F1.\n\nThus, F2 would have:\n\n- C_C_B_B (25%)\n- C_C_bb (25%)\n- c_c_B_B (25%)\n- c_c_bb (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nSumming to 100%, with each phenotype occurring once.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this exactly. Option D says Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. That's a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which matches 25% each if multiplied by 4. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s 25% each, but 1+3+9+3=16. That suggests scaling up by a factor of 16, but that doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are showing the count per phenotype rather than percentages. So for example, 1 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, etc., totaling 16.\n\nIn reality, each phenotype occurs 4 times in 16, giving a ratio of 1:3:9:3. Which is option D.\n\nBut earlier analysis suggested 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to 16 parts, but in the options, it's presented as counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are using a scale where each 'unit' represents 4 pigeons, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about F1 instead of F2.\n\nIf the question is about F1, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching any options",

They're crossed, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio in their F2 generation. The options are A through J, each giving different ratios.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- The first bird has genotype CCBB. So, according to the genes mentioned:\n  - C is the dominant for checkered pattern.\n  - c is the recessive for plain pattern.\n  - B is the dominant for red color.\n  - b is the recessive for brown color.\n\n- The second bird is plain brown, which would be genotype ccbb. That makes sense because both alleles are recessive.\n\nNow, they want an F2 generation from a cross between these two parents. Wait, no\u2014the initial description says \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So actually, the parents are both homozygous? Because CCBB means both parents have two dominant alleles for their traits.\n\nWait, but when you have a cross between two homozygous individuals, you get all possible combinations. But since they're already homozygous, the offspring will be either heterozygous or homozygous based on their parents' alleles.\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent is homozygous, so the offspring can only inherit two copies of each gene from them. Since the parents are CCBB and ccbb, any offspring will receive CC from the first parent and cc from the second. Similarly, BB from the first and bb from the second.\n\nSo, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. For example, for the C gene, the first parent gives C, and the second gives c. So the offspring will always be Cc for the C gene. Similarly, for B and b, the first parent gives B and the second gives b, so the offspring will always be Bb.\n\nPutting it together, each offspring will have the genotype CcBb. Now, what about their phenotype?\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes. Let's see:\n\n- For the pattern (C/c):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 Checkered (C)\n  - c is recessive \u2192 Plain (c)\n\n- For color (B/b):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 Red (B)\n  - b is recessive \u2192 Brown (b)\n\nSince each gene is independent, the combination of C/c and B/b will determine the phenotype.\n\nSo, let's list all possibilities:\n\n- If the bird is Cc (checkered) and Bb (red), then the phenotype is Checkered Red.\n- If the bird is Cc (checkered) and bb (brown), then it's Checkered Brown.\n- If cc (plain) and Bb (red), then it's Plain Red.\n- If cc (plain) and bb (brown), then it's Plain Brown.\n\nBut wait, the parents are both homozygous, so all offspring will be CcBb. Therefore, all F1 will be CcBb.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about F2 generation, which suggests that maybe there was a previous cross before the F2 generation. Hmm, perhaps I misread the setup.\n\nLet me reread the initial part:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color by recessive c. Red by dominant B; brown by recessive b. So, each bird has two alleles for each gene.\n\nWhen they say \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" that seems confusing. Adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross is between two birds that are homozygous for different traits. Like one is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about a dihybrid cross where each parent is a heterozygote for each trait, but the wording isn't clear.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's message, they wrote:\n\n\"Problem: The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nHmm, \"adihybrid\" usually refers to crossing two different traits. But if both parents are homozygous, like CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would be CcBb, as previously thought.\n\nBut then why talk about F2? Unless I misunderstood the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe one is CC BB and the other is cc bb, making them purebred and thus producing only heterozygotes in the next generation.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would result from selfing or intercrossing.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions an F2 generation, implying that F1 must have produced F2.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf one parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive), then:\n\n- F1 would be CcBb (heterozygous for both traits).\n\nThen, F2 would come from selfing F1 birds.\n\nEach F1 bird would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo, the Punnett square for F1 x F1 would look like:\n\n          Gametes from Parent 1 | Gametes from Parent 2\n          ---------------------------+-------------------------\n          CB                        | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cb                        | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cB                        | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cb                        | CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Each parent contributes one gamete, so the Punnett square should consider all combinations.\n\nActually, the F1 birds are all CcBb, so each can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB (C from first gene, B from second)\n- 25% cb (c from first gene, b from second)\n- 25% cB (c from first gene, B from second)\n- 25% cb (same as above, just swapped letters)\n\nWait, no\u2014if the bird is CcBb, it can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each with equal probability.\n\nSo the Punnett square for F1 x F1 would be:\n\nGametes from Parent 1      Gametes from Parent 2\nCB              | CB, cb, cB, cb\ncb              | CB, cb, cB, cb\ncB              | CB, cb, cB, cb\ncb              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nEach cell represents a possible combination. Since each parent produces 25% of each gamete, the overall probabilities would be:\n\nFor each trait independently, the chance of each allele is 25%. So for Cc and Bb:\n\n- C (dominant) = 75%\n- c (recessive) = 25%\n- B (dominant) = 75%\n- b (recessive) = 25%\n\nThus, the F1 population would have:\n\n- Checkered Pattern: 75%\n- Plain Pattern: 25%\n- Red Color: 75%\n- Brown Color: 25%\n\nBut the question is asking about F2 generation, so we need to go beyond F1.\n\nAssuming that the F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will consist of all possible combinations from F1 x F1.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we'll calculate the frequency of each genotype and then convert to phenotypes.\n\nFirst, let's outline the possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor the pattern (C/c):\n\n- C (Checkered): 75% (from 3/4)\n- c (Plain): 25% (from 1/4)\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\n- B (Red): 75% (from 3/4)\n- b (Brown): 25% (from 1/4)\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each trait's probabilities.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (Checkered Red)\n2. CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n3. cc BB (Plain Red)\n4. cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each trait is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No, that's way off.\n\nOption F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Still not matching.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of each phenotype. Let me think again.\n\nEach individual in the F2 generation will contribute to the next generation, but considering the genetic makeup, the distribution might not be uniform.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using a Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nGiven that F1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n- 25% cB\n- 25% cb\n\nSo, the F2 generation will consist of all possible combinations:\n\n- From CB x CB \u2192 CcBb (but actually, each bird produces gametes, so F2 will be combinations of gametes)\n\nWait, more accurately, each F1 bird contributes a gamete, so F2 will have combinations of two gametes:\n\nPossible gametes from F1: CB, cb, cB, cb (all 25%)\n\nSo, F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- CB + cB \u2192 CcBb (Checkered Red)\n- CB + cb \u2192 same as above\n- cb + CB \u2192 same\n- cb + cb \u2192 c c B b \u2192 c c B b \u2192 plain red\n- cb + cB \u2192 c c B b \u2192 plain red\n- cb + cb \u2192 same\n- etc.\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting complicated. Instead, perhaps it's better to compute the probabilities directly.\n\nEach trait is independent, so the proportion of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the pattern (C/c):\n\n- 75% Checkered (C)\n- 25% Plain (c)\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\n- 75% Red (B)\n- 25% Brown (b)\n\nCombined, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits dominant: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Checkered, Brown: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Plain, Red: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 Plain Red\n- Both traits recessive: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:6:6:1, which simplifies to 9:6:6:1. Converting to whole numbers, multiply by 1000: 9000:6000:6000:1000, but dividing by common factors:\n\nDivide all by 1: 9:6:6:1\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 9 : 6 : 6 : 1\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

Adihybrid refers to cross between two different traits, like Aa x Aa. So perhaps it's a typo, and the intended cross is between two different traits, say, one bird is AA bb and the other aa BB, leading to F1 being AaBb.\n\nBut the initial statement said \"homos... red bird and a plain brown bird\", which is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is between two birds that are homozygous for different traits. For example, one bird is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would result from selfing F1.\n\nIn that case, the F1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (each 25%).\n\nThe Punnett square for F1 x F1 would look like:\n\n          Gametes from Parent 1 | Gametes from Parent 2\n          ---------------------------+-------------------------\n          CB              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cb              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cB              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cb              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nEach cell shows the combination of gametes, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccBB\n- cb + cB \u2192 ccBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccBB\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each combination leads to different genotypes:\n\nFrom CB (from Parent 1) and CB (from Parent 2): CcBb\n\nCB and cb: CcBb\n\nCB and cB: CcBb\n\nCB and cb: CcBb\n\nSimilarly for other gametes. Wait, actually, each combination results in CcBb, except when both gametes are cb, resulting in ccBB.\n\nSo, how many of each genotype?\n\n- CcBb occurs when both gametes carry one allele from each parent. There are three such combinations: CB + cb, CB + cB, cb + CB. So 3 instances of CcBb.\n\n- ccBB occurs when both gametes are cb. Only 1 instance.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- ccBB \u2192 Plain Red (since c is recessive and B is dominant)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered Red : Plain Red = 3 : 1\n\nAdditionally, we have Checkered Brown and Plain Brown, but in this cross, the second bird is homozygous recessive (cc BB), so all offspring are CcBb, meaning they can't be Checkered Brown or Plain Brown.\n\nWait, that contradicts earlier thoughts. Let me think again.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then:\n\n- F1 would be CcBb (because each gene is inherited independently).\n- All F1s would be CcBb, so all would express CcBb.\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Checkered Pattern (C) and Red Color (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Checkered Pattern (C) and Brown Color (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Plain Pattern (c) and Red Color (B) \u2192 Plain Red\n- Plain Pattern (c) and Brown Color (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nBut wait, if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 is CcBb, which is all CcBb. So, in reality, all F1s would be CcBb, meaning they are either Checkered Red or Checkered Brown or Plain Red or Plain Brown.\n\nWait, but in the cross described, it's a dihybrid cross between two different genotypes. So, let's assume the parents are CC BB (which is all CcBb) and cc bb (also all CcBb). Thus, all F1s",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves two birds, one that's a checkered red and another that's plain brown. They're crossed, and we need to determine the phenotypic ratio in their F2 generation. The options are A through J, each giving different ratios.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- The first bird has genotype CCBB. So, according to the genes mentioned:\n  - C is the dominant for checkered pattern.\n  - c is the recessive for plain pattern.\n  - B is the dominant for red color.\n  - b is the recessive for brown color.\n\n- The second bird is plain brown, which would be genotype ccbb. That makes sense because both alleles are recessive.\n\nNow, they want an F2 generation from a cross between these two parents. Wait, no\u2014the initial description says \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So actually, the parents are both homozygous? Because CCBB means both parents have two dominant alleles for their traits.\n\nWait, but when you have a cross between two homozygous individuals, you get all possible combinations. But since they're already homozygous, the offspring will be either heterozygous or homozygous based on their parents' alleles.\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent is homozygous, so the offspring can only inherit two copies of each gene from them. Since the parents are CCBB and ccbb, any offspring will receive CC from the first parent and cc from the second. Similarly, BB from the first and bb from the second.\n\nSo, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. For example, for the C gene, the first parent gives C, and the second gives c. So the offspring will always be Cc for the C gene. Similarly, for B and b, the first parent gives B and the second gives b, so the offspring will always be Bb.\n\nPutting it together, each offspring will have the genotype CcBb. Now, what about their phenotype?\n\nPhenotype depends on both genes. Let's see:\n\n- For the pattern (C/c):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 Checkered (C)\n  - c is recessive \u2192 Plain (c)\n\n- For color (B/b):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 Red (B)\n  - b is recessive \u2192 Brown (b)\n\nSince each gene is independent, the combination of C/c and B/b will determine the phenotype.\n\nSo, let's list all possibilities:\n\n- If the bird is Cc (checkered) and Bb (red), then the phenotype is Checkered Red.\n- If the bird is Cc (checkered) and bb (brown), then it's Checkered Brown.\n- If cc (plain) and Bb (red), then it's Plain Red.\n- If cc (plain) and bb (brown), then it's Plain Brown.\n\nBut wait, the parents are both homozygous, so all offspring will be CcBb. Therefore, all F1 will be CcBb.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about F2 generation, which suggests that maybe there was a previous cross before the F2 generation. Hmm, perhaps I misread the setup.\n\nLet me reread the initial part:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color by recessive c. Red by dominant B; brown by recessive b. So, each bird has two alleles for each gene.\n\nWhen they say \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" that seems confusing. Adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross is between two birds that are homozygous for different traits. Like one is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about a dihybrid cross where each parent is a heterozygote for each trait, but the wording isn't clear.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's message, they wrote:\n\n\"Problem: The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nHmm, \"adihybrid\" usually refers to crossing two different traits. But if both parents are homozygous, like CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would be CcBb, as previously thought.\n\nBut then why talk about F2? Unless I misunderstood the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe one is CC BB and the other is cc bb, making them purebred and thus producing only heterozygotes in the next generation.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would result from selfing or intercrossing.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions an F2 generation, implying that F1 must have produced F2.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf one parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive), then:\n\n- F1 would be CcBb (heterozygous for both traits).\n\nThen, F2 would come from selfing F1 birds.\n\nEach F1 bird would produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo, the Punnett square for F1 x F1 would look like:\n\n          Gametes from Parent 1 | Gametes from Parent 2\n          ---------------------------+-------------------------\n          CB                        | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cb                        | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cB                        | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cb                        | CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Each parent contributes one gamete, so the Punnett square should consider all combinations.\n\nActually, the F1 birds are all CcBb, so each can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB (C from first gene, B from second)\n- 25% cb (c from first gene, b from second)\n- 25% cB (c from first gene, B from second)\n- 25% cb (same as above, just swapped letters)\n\nWait, no\u2014if the bird is CcBb, it can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each with equal probability.\n\nSo the Punnett square for F1 x F1 would be:\n\nGametes from Parent 1      Gametes from Parent 2\nCB              | CB, cb, cB, cb\ncb              | CB, cb, cB, cb\ncB              | CB, cb, cB, cb\ncb              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nEach cell represents a possible combination. Since each parent produces 25% of each gamete, the overall probabilities would be:\n\nFor each trait independently, the chance of each allele is 25%. So for Cc and Bb:\n\n- C (dominant) = 75%\n- c (recessive) = 25%\n- B (dominant) = 75%\n- b (recessive) = 25%\n\nThus, the F1 population would have:\n\n- Checkered Pattern: 75%\n- Plain Pattern: 25%\n- Red Color: 75%\n- Brown Color: 25%\n\nBut the question is asking about F2 generation, so we need to go beyond F1.\n\nAssuming that the F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will consist of all possible combinations from F1 x F1.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we'll calculate the frequency of each genotype and then convert to phenotypes.\n\nFirst, let's outline the possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor the pattern (C/c):\n\n- C (Checkered): 75% (from 3/4)\n- c (Plain): 25% (from 1/4)\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\n- B (Red): 75% (from 3/4)\n- b (Brown): 25% (from 1/4)\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each trait's probabilities.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (Checkered Red)\n2. CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n3. cc BB (Plain Red)\n4. cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each trait is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No, that's way off.\n\nOption F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Still not matching.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of each phenotype.

Instead, perhaps it's better to compute the probabilities directly.\n\nEach trait is independent, so the proportion of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the pattern (C/c):\n\n- 75% Checkered (C)\n- 25% Plain (c)\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\n- 75% Red (B)\n- 25% Brown (b)\n\nCombined, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits dominant: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Checkered, Brown: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Plain, Red: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 Plain Red\n- Both traits recessive: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:6:6:1, which simplifies to 9:6:6:1. Converting to whole numbers, multiply by 1000: 9000:6000:6000:1000, but dividing by common factors:\n\nDivide all by 1: 9:6:6:1\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 9 : 6 : 6 : 1\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would result from selfing F1.\n\nIn that case, the F1 is CcBb, which can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (each 25%).\n\nThe Punnett square for F1 x F1 would look like:\n\n          Gametes from Parent 1 | Gametes from Parent 2\n          ---------------------------+-------------------------\n          CB              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cb              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cB              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n          cb              | CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nEach cell shows the combination of gametes, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccBB\n- cb + cB \u2192 ccBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccBB\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each combination leads to different genotypes:\n\nFrom CB (from Parent 1) and CB (from Parent 2): CcBb\n\nCB and cb: CcBb\n\nCB and cB: CcBb\n\nCB and cb: CcBb\n\nSimilarly for other gametes. Wait, actually, each combination results in CcBb, except when both gametes are cb, resulting in ccBB.\n\nSo, how many of each genotype?\n\n- CcBb occurs when both gametes carry one allele from each parent. There are three such combinations: CB + cb, CB + cB, cb + CB. So 3 instances of CcBb.\n\n- ccBB occurs when both gametes are cb. Only 1 instance.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- ccBB \u2192 Plain Red (since c is recessive and B is dominant)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered Red : Plain Red = 3 : 1\n\nAdditionally, we have Checkered Brown and Plain Brown, but in this cross, the second bird is homozygous recessive (cc BB), so all offspring are CcBb, meaning they can't be Checkered Brown or Plain Brown.\n\nWait, that contradicts earlier thoughts. Let me think again.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then:\n\n- F1 would be CcBb (because each gene is inherited independently).\n- All F1s would be CcBb, so all would express CcBb.\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Checkered Pattern (C) and Red Color (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Checkered Pattern (C) and Brown Color (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Plain Pattern (c) and Red Color (B) \u2192 Plain Red\n- Plain Pattern (c) and Brown Color (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nBut wait, if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 is CcBb, which is all CcBb. So, in reality, all F1s would be CcBb, meaning they are either Checkered Red or Checkered Brown or Plain Red or Plain Brown.\n\nWait, but in the cross described, it's a dihybrid cross between two different genotypes. So, let's assume the parents are CC BB (which is all CcBb) and cc bb (also all CcBb). Thus, all F1s",

One bird is a homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown (cc bb). We need to create a Punnett square for their offspring and determine the phenotypic ratio based on the genotypes they produce.\n\nFirst, I should break down the parents' genes. The first parent is CC BB, which means both alleles are dominant for both traits. So, they're very fit and will pass on both dominant alleles to all their offspring. The second parent is cc bb, meaning both alleles are recessive. They'll pass on one recessive allele each for both traits because they can't express the dominant traits due to the recessive alleles.\n\nNow, let's think about how these genes interact. The first trait is color, controlled by the gene B. Dominant B makes the bird checkered red or brown, while recessive b makes them plain red or brown. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that checkered color is determined by the dominant allele C, and plain is recessive c. Then red is dominant B, brown is recessive b. Hmm, maybe I got that backward. Let me clarify:\n\n- C is dominant, so C_B would give checkered red.\n- c is recessive, so c_b would give plain brown.\nBut wait, the initial statement said \"plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So if someone has at least one c allele, they have plain color. But then, the colors themselves depend on another gene, B. Checkered is B, plain is b. And red is dominant, brown is recessive. So perhaps the presence of B allows for red color, and b reduces it to brown? Or vice versa?\n\nWait, maybe I should structure this correctly. The first trait is color, governed by B (dominant) and b (recessive). So, regardless of anything else, having at least one B allele gives the bird checkered color. If they have b, they get plain color. But then, the other trait is size, determined by B (checkered) and b (plain), but also influenced by the checkered color\u2014wait, no, the problem states that red is B and brown is b, independent of C.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the problem as given:\n\nParents:\n- Homozygous checkered red: CC BB\n- Plain brown: cc bb\n\nSo when they mate, we need to find the possible gametes each can produce and then combine them.\n\nFor the first parent, CC BB: since both alleles are dominant, they can only produce gametes with C and B. So all their gametes are CB.\n\nFor the second parent, cc bb: both alleles are recessive, so they can only produce gametes with c and b. All their gametes are cb.\n\nSo when they mate, the F1 generation will be CB * cb = CcBb.\n\nIn the F2 generation, which is generated from the F1 selfing, the possible gametes are:\n\nFrom CcBb:\n- C can come from either C or c, and B can come from either B or b.\nSo the possible gametes are:\n- CB (from C and B)\n- Cb (from C and b)\n- cB (from c and B)\n- cb (from c and b)\n\nThus, the F2 population will consist of these four types of gametes, each occurring in equal frequency, assuming random mating.\n\nNow, looking at the phenotypes based on the combination of C and c and B and b.\n\nThe phenotype depends on both the dominance relationships and the interaction between the genes.\n\nLet's map the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C) and BB (B): Checkered red (since dominant B allows red)\n- CC (C) and Bb (B): Checkered brown (because B allows red, b makes it brown)\n- cc (c) and BB (B): Plain red (since recessive c makes it plain)\n- cc (c) and Bb (B): Plain brown (same reason)\n\nAdditionally, the presence of dominant alleles allows the bird to have red color, while the recessive allele makes it brown. Similarly, the presence of dominant B allows red, recessive b makes it brown.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, red is dominant B, and brown is recessive b. So regardless of the other gene C, having B allows red, and not having B (i.e., having b) allows brown.\n\nSimilarly, the other gene C doesn't affect the color phenotype directly but affects the size of the bird, I suppose. But for the purpose of this problem, we're only concerned with the color phenotype, which depends on both B and b.\n\nWait, actually, the problem mentions that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the color is determined by B. So the presence of B allows for red color, and b makes it brown. The presence of c affects the pattern, making it plain instead of checkered, but the color itself remains red or brown depending on B.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- If any bird has at least one B allele (either C or c), they will have checkered color (red).\n- If all alleles are b (c and c), they will have plain color (brown).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends solely on whether they have at least one B allele. The other gene (C) determines the size or perhaps some other aspect, but for our purposes, we're focusing on the color.\n\nWait, but the problem also mentions that the checkered pattern is C, and plain is c. So if a bird is checkered (C_), its pattern is checkered, but if it's plain (cc), it's plain, regardless of B. However, the color itself is determined by B. So, a plain bird could still have red or brown color based on B.\n\nSo, putting it together, the phenotype for each bird is:\n\n- If they have at least one B allele (so either C or B), they are checkered red.\n- If they have all b alleles (only c and c), they are plain brown.\n\nThis applies regardless of the C and c genes. So, all F2 birds with B present will have checkered red, and those without B will have plain brown.\n\nGiven that, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nSince the F2 is derived from F1 selfing, and F1 is CcBb, the possible gametes are equally likely among the four combinations: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nEach gamete occurs in 25% of the F2.\n\nNow, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- Any bird with C or B will have checkered red.\n- Birds with only c and c (i.e., cb) will have plain brown.\n\nSo, half of the F2 individuals will have checkered red (since they have at least one B), and the other half will have plain brown (since they have only c alleles). Because each gamete contributes either C/B or c/b.\n\nWait, but in reality, since each bird must contribute one allele from each gene pair, the chance of getting at least one B allele is 75%, and the chance of getting at least one c allele is 25%. Since these events are independent, the probability of a bird having at least one B is 75%, and the probability of having at least one c is 25%.\n\nHowever, the presence of B determines red, and the presence of c determines plain. So, regardless of the other gene (C), as long as there's at least one B, the bird is checkered red. So, the actual outcome is:\n\n- 75% checkered red\n- 25% plain brown\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, etc.\u2014doesn't add up to 100%, probably incorrect.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't seem right.\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown\u2014this seems off because if there are 12 checkered red, and the rest is plain, but 12 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 16, which might not sum to 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf each F2 individual has a 75% chance of being checkered red and 25% chance of being plain brown, and assuming the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (as per option D):\n\n- 12 checkered red (75% of 16 is 12)\n- 4 checkered brown (25% of 16 is 4)\n- 0 plain red (since all are plain brown)\n- 4 plain brown\n\nBut none of the options match exactly except maybe Option J, which is 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\u2014no, that doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the checkered pattern is only expressed when both C and B are present, not just C. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, so perhaps the checkered pattern is only expressed when both C and B are present. Otherwise, it's plain. That changes things.\n\nSo, a bird with at least one C and at least one B allele will have checkered red. If they have at least one c allele, they'll have plain brown, regardless of B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes now depend on both C and B.\n\nTo determine the phenotypes:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B allele: Checkered red.\n- If the bird has at least one c allele: Plain brown.\n\nBecause even if they have C but no B, they won't have checkered red\u2014they'll have plain red because they lack B. Similarly, if they have c but no B, they'll have plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: When both C and B are present.\n- Plain brown: When at least one c allele is present (regardless of B).\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportions.\n\nEach bird in F2 has a genotype determined by the combination of C and B, and c and b.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I need to consider all possible combinations more carefully.\n\nActually, each gene is independently assorting, so the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C and B:\n- CC (C), CB (B), BC (B), BB (B)\n\nFor c and b:\n- cc (c), cb (b), bc (b), bb (b)\n\nWhen combining these, the phenotype is determined by whether C and B are present.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (anywhere) and B is present (anywhere), they are Checkered red.\n- Else, if c is present anywhere, they are Plain brown.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes leading to different phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | C_B_ (at least one C and at least one B)\nPlain brown | Not C_B_ (can be cc, Cb, cB, or bb, but not C_B_)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nThe probability of having at least one C allele is 3/4 (since for a gene with two alleles, the chance of not having C is 1/4, so having at least one C is 3/4).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one B allele is 3/4.\n\nHowever, the presence of C and B are independent events, so the probability of having both is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nTherefore, the probability of being Checkered red is 9/16.\n\nThe probability of being Plain brown is 1 - 9/16 = 7/16.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation, 9/16 will be Checkered red and 7/16 will be Plain brown.\n\nAssuming 16 birds in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 birds\n- Plain brown: 7 birds\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none of them match this exactly. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nOptions A to H don't seem to match 9 Checkered red and 7 Plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance. Let me double-check.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is C (dominant)\n- Plain is c (recessive)\n- Red is B (dominant)\n- Brown is b (recessive)\n\nSo, the presence of C allows checkering, and presence of B allows red color. However, if a bird is plain (only c), it cannot have red unless B is present.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is plain (only c), they can't have red color because B is required to allow red. So, the presence of B determines red color, irrespective of C.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me try again.\n\nThe checkered pattern is C (dominant). So, any bird with at least one C allele will have checkered pattern. The color is determined by B: dominant B allows red, recessive b allows brown.\n\nBut the plain color is determined by c. So, a bird is plain if they have only c alleles (cc) regardless of B.\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both C and B:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and at least one B allele, they have Checkered red.\n- If a bird has at least one c allele (regardless of B), they have Plain brown.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation:\n\n- 9/16 have both C and B \u2192 Checkered red.\n- 7/16 have at least one c \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, in 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Plain brown: 7\n\nNone of the answer options seem to match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nL. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nM. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nN. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nO. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nP. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nQ. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nR. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nS. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nT. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nU. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nV. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nW. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nX. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nY. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nZ. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match 9 Checkered red and 7 Plain brown. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the checkered pattern requires both C and B to be present, and the color depends on B alone. Let me revisit that.\n\nIf the checkered pattern is C (dominant), and the color is determined by B (dominant for red, recessive for brown), regardless of whether they are checkered or not, then:\n\n- Any bird with C will have checkered pattern, and their color depends on B.\n\nSo, if a bird has C, their color is determined by B:\n\n- CB \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one C\n- Plain brown: No C\n\nWhich would mean:\n\nProbability of Checkered red: 3/4 (since 1/4 have cc)\nProbability of Plain brown: 1/4\n\nIn 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 12\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, maybe the checkered pattern is only visible when both C and B are present, and the color is determined by B.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- If a bird has both C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n- If a bird has B \u2192 Checkered red (even if c)\n- If a bird has c \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: Has at least one C and at least one B\n- Plain brown: No c (regardless of B)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nProbability of having at least one C: 3/4\nProbability of having at least one B: 3/4\nProbability of having both C and B: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nThus, 9/16 Checkered red and 7/16 Plain brown, same as before.\n\nStill, none of the answer options match this. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered pattern is only present when both C and B are present, but the color is determined by B alone. So, in that case:\n\n- Any bird with C and B will have Checkered red.\n- Any bird with B will have Checkered red.\n- Any bird with c will have Plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one",

Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have two birds crossed in an adihybrid cross. One bird is a homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown (cc bb). We need to create a Punnett square for their offspring and determine the phenotypic ratio based on the genotypes they produce.\n\nFirst, I should break down the parents' genes.

Because each gamete contributes either C/B or c/b.\n\nWait, but in reality, since each bird must contribute one allele from each gene pair, the chance of getting at least one B allele is 75%, and the chance of getting at least one c allele is 25%. Since these events are independent, the probability of a bird having at least one B is 75%, and the probability of having at least one c is 25%.\n\nHowever, the presence of B determines red, and the presence of c determines plain. So, regardless of the other gene (C), as long as there's at least one B, the bird is checkered red. So, the actual outcome is:\n\n- 75% checkered red\n- 25% plain brown\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, etc.\u2014doesn't add up to 100%, probably incorrect.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't seem right.\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 0 checkered brown\u2014this seems off because if there are 12 checkered red, and the rest is plain, but 12 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 16, which might not sum to 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf each F2 individual has a 75% chance of being checkered red and 25% chance of being plain brown, and assuming the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (as per option D):\n\n- 12 checkered red (75% of 16 is 12)\n- 4 checkered brown (25% of 16 is 4)\n- 0 plain red (since all are plain brown)\n- 4 plain brown\n\nBut none of the options match exactly except maybe Option J, which is 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\u2014no, that doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the checkered pattern is only expressed when both C and B are present, not just C. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, so perhaps the checkered pattern is only expressed when both C and B are present. Otherwise, it's plain. That changes things.\n\nSo, a bird with at least one C and at least one B allele will have checkered red. If they have at least one c allele, they'll have plain brown, regardless of B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes now depend on both C and B.\n\nTo determine the phenotypes:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B allele: Checkered red.\n- If the bird has at least one c allele: Plain brown.\n\nBecause even if they have C but no B, they won't have checkered red\u2014they'll have plain red because they lack B. Similarly, if they have c but no B, they'll have plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: When both C and B are present.\n- Plain brown: When at least one c allele is present (regardless of B).\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportions.\n\nEach bird in F2 has a genotype determined by the combination of C and B, and c and b.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B): Checkered red\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I need to consider all possible combinations more carefully.\n\nActually, each gene is independently assorting, so the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C and B:\n- CC (C), CB (B), BC (B), BB (B)\n\nFor c and b:\n- cc (c), cb (b), bc (b), bb (b)\n\nWhen combining these, the phenotype is determined by whether C and B are present.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (anywhere) and B is present (anywhere), they are Checkered red.\n- Else, if c is present anywhere, they are Plain brown.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes leading to different phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | C_B_ (at least one C and at least one B)\nPlain brown | Not C_B_ (can be cc, Cb, cB, or bb, but not C_B_)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nThe probability of having at least one C allele is 3/4 (since for a gene with two alleles, the chance of not having C is 1/4, so having at least one C is 3/4).\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one B allele is 3/4.\n\nHowever, the presence of C and B are independent events, so the probability of having both is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nTherefore, the probability of being Checkered red is 9/16.\n\nThe probability of being Plain brown is 1 - 9/16 = 7/16.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation, 9/16 will be Checkered red and 7/16 will be Plain brown.\n\nAssuming 16 birds in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 birds\n- Plain brown: 7 birds\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none of them match this exactly. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nOptions A to H don't seem to match 9 Checkered red and 7 Plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance. Let me double-check.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is C (dominant)\n- Plain is c (recessive)\n- Red is B (dominant)\n- Brown is b (recessive)\n\nSo, the presence of C allows checkering, and presence of B allows red color. However, if a bird is plain (only c), it cannot have red unless B is present.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is plain (only c), they can't have red color because B is required to allow red. So, the presence of B determines red color, irrespective of C.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me try again.\n\nThe checkered pattern is C (dominant). So, any bird with at least one C allele will have checkered pattern. The color is determined by B: dominant B allows red, recessive b allows brown.\n\nBut the plain color is determined by c. So, a bird is plain if they have only c alleles (cc) regardless of B.\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both C and B:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and at least one B allele, they have Checkered red.\n- If a bird has at least one c allele (regardless of B), they have Plain brown.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation:\n\n- 9/16 have both C and B \u2192 Checkered red.\n- 7/16 have at least one c \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, in 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Plain brown: 7\n\nNone of the answer options seem to match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nL. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nM. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nN. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nO. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nP. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nQ. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nR. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nS. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nT. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nU. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nV. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nW. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nX. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nY. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nZ. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match 9 Checkered red and 7 Plain brown. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the checkered pattern requires both C and B to be present, and the color depends on B alone. Let me revisit that.\n\nIf the checkered pattern is C (dominant), and the color is determined by B (dominant for red, recessive for brown), regardless of whether they are checkered or not, then:\n\n- Any bird with C will have checkered pattern, and their color depends on B.\n\nSo, if a bird has C, their color is determined by B:\n\n- CB \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one C\n- Plain brown: No C\n\nWhich would mean:\n\nProbability of Checkered red: 3/4 (since 1/4 have cc)\nProbability of Plain brown: 1/4\n\nIn 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 12\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, maybe the checkered pattern is only visible when both C and B are present, and the color is determined by B.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- If a bird has both C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n- If a bird has B \u2192 Checkered red (even if c)\n- If a bird has c \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered red: Has at least one C and at least one B\n- Plain brown: No c (regardless of B)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nProbability of having at least one C: 3/4\nProbability of having at least one B: 3/4\nProbability of having both C and B: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nThus, 9/16 Checkered red and 7/16 Plain brown, same as before.\n\nStill, none of the answer options match this. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered pattern is only present when both C and B are present, but the color is determined by B alone. So, in that case:\n\n- Any bird with C and B will have Checkered red.\n- Any bird with B will have Checkered red.\n- Any bird with c will have Plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one",

    "chunk_resampled": "It involves two traits: the color of the birds and their genetic makeup.",
    "rollout": " It involves two traits: the color of the birds and their genetic makeup. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions that there are two genes involved. One determines whether a bird is red or brown (gene B), and the other determines if it's checkered or plain (gene C). The alleles are uppercase for dominant traits and lowercase for recessives. So, B means red, and b means brown because B is dominant over b. Similarly, C is checkered, and c is plain because c is recessive.\n\nThe parents involved in the cross are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. That means the first parent has both dominant alleles for both genes, right? So, their genotype would be CC BB. The second parent is plain brown, which means they're homozygous recessive for both genes: cc bb.\n\nNow, we need to set up a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross between these two parents. Wait, no, actually, the question says \"adahybrid cross,\" but maybe that was a typo. Oh well, probably just referring to a regular dihybrid cross since there are two genes involved.\n\nSo, let's outline the possible gametes each parent can produce. For the first parent (CC BB), since both alleles are dominant, they'll only produce one type of gamete: C and B. So, all gametes from them will be CB.\n\nFor the second parent (cc bb), both alleles are recessive, so they'll produce only one type of gamete: c and b. All their gametes will be cb.\n\nWhen you cross these two, each parent contributes one gamete. So the offspring will have combinations of C and c for gene C, and B and b for gene B. But wait, hold on\u2014the question specifies an F2 generation, which usually comes from a dihybrid cross. Maybe I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nActually, when you have a dihybrid cross between two parents who are both heterozygotes (like CC BB and cc bb), the F1 generation will all be CcBb. Then the F2 generation comes from selfing F1 individuals. So I think the user might have meant an F2 generation after selfing the F1, not a dihybrid cross itself.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial setup, the user wrote \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, perhaps that was a mistake. Normally, a dihybrid cross involves crossing two heterozygotes. Since both parents here are homozygous, it's more like a test cross or something else. But the problem then goes on to talk about F1, F2 generations, which suggests it's a typical dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me re-express the problem correctly.\n\nParents:\n- Homozygous checkered red: CC BB\n- Plain brown: cc bb\n\nThey cross each other, resulting in F1 generation. Then, the F1s self-pollinate to get F2.\n\nBut wait, the user then asks about F1\u00d7F1, but then mentions F2. Maybe I should focus on F2 because the options involve F2 generations.\n\nLet me structure this properly:\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous)\n\nCross: Parent 1 \u00d7 Parent 2 \u2192 F1\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 \u2192 F2\n\nWait, but the original question seems to have a typo in stating adahybridcross, as dihybrid crosses typically don't use 'adahybrid.' So perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygotes. Maybe the user intended that but made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are different.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So both parents are homozygous. That makes sense for a test cross, but then how do you get F2? Because when you have homozygous parents, their offspring are all heterozygotes, and selfing those gives F2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct parents are both heterozygotes, but the user mistakenly stated homozygous. But regardless, proceeding with what the user provided.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are heterozygous, but described incorrectly. Let's assume that Parent 1 is Cc BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, making them heterozygous for both genes. That would make more sense for a typical dihybrid cross leading to F2.\n\nAssuming that's the case, let's proceed.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: Cc BB (heterozygous)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (heterozygous)\n\nCross: Parent 1 \u00d7 Parent 2 \u2192 F1\n\nThen F1 \u00d7 F1 \u2192 F2\n\nIn that scenario, the F2 generation will follow Mendel's laws, producing four phenotypic classes based on the combination of alleles.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options given include various ratios, so perhaps the user is considering different scenarios.\n\nBut the problem states \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross...\". Adihybrid cross refers to a cross between two individuals who are both heterozygotes. So, perhaps the initial description was correct.\n\nWait, going back to the user's exact wording: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, parents are CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous).\n\nTheir F1 would all be CcBb.\n\nThen F1 selfed to get F2.\n\nNow, let's construct the Punnett square for F2.\n\nEach parent produces gametes: C and c for C and B/B, and c and b for C and b.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the F1 is CcBb, meaning each gene is independently assorting. So, for gene C, the alleles are C and c, and for gene B, B and b.\n\nSo, the F1 F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nEach gamete from F1 will combine with each gamete from F1.\n\nLet's list the possible gametes:\n\nParent 1 (F1): C and c for C; B and b for B.\n\nParent 2 (F1): C and c for C; B and b for B.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, each F1 individual has the genotype CcBb. So, when selfing, each gene segregates independently.\n\nSo, for gene C: 50% C and 50% c.\n\nFor gene B: 50% B and 50% b.\n\nTherefore, the gametes from F1 will be:\n\nFor gene C: C and c.\n\nFor gene B: B and b.\n\nSo, combining both, the gametes are: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nThus, each F1 parent will produce these four types of gametes with equal probability (25%).\n\nWhen F1 \u00d7 F1 occurs, each gamete from F1 combines with each gamete from F1.\n\nSo, the Punnett square will have each F1 gamete pairing with the others.\n\nCalculating the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by its alleles for both genes. Since the genes are independent, the combination is:\n\n- Gene C: C (checkered) or c (plain)\n- Gene B: B (red) or b (brown)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Brown (c_B_)\n3. Plain Red (C_bb)\n4. Plain Brown (c_bb)\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nFor gene C, 25% C (checkered) and 75% c (plain).\nFor gene B, 25% B (red) and 75% b (brown).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\n1. Checkered Red: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown: (25% C) * (75% b) = 18.75%\n3. Plain Red: (75% c) * (25% B) = 18.75%\n4. Plain Brown: (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nRounded to whole numbers, the ratio is approximately 6 : 2 : 2 : 4.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption D: checkered red 1, brown 3, plain red 9, brown 3 \u2192 No.\nOption J: checkered red 2, brown 6, plain red 3, brown 1 \u2192 No.\nOption E: checkered red 3, brown 9, plain red 1, brown 3 \u2192 No.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 This matches exactly except option A uses 6,2,6,2, whereas our calculation is 6,2,2,4. Closest is A, but let's see the options again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled from A to H, each with specific ratios. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which matches my calculated approximate values, assuming rounding. So, the closest match is option A.\n\nWait, but let's double-check the math.\n\nEach gene is independent, so:\n\nProbability of C being present (checkered) is 25%, and B being present (red) is 25%. So, C and B together is 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, C and b (brown) is 6.25%, b and B is 18.75%, and b and b is 18.75%.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 6,2,2,4. So the ratio is 6:2:2:4, which corresponds to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So, for gene C, the alleles are C and c, and for gene B, B and b.\n\nSo, the F1 F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nEach gamete from F1 will combine with each gamete from F1.\n\nLet's list the possible gametes:\n\nParent 1 (F1): C and c for C; B and b for B.\n\nParent 2 (F1): C and c for C; B and b for B.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, each F1 individual has the genotype CcBb. So, when selfing, each gene segregates independently.\n\nSo, for gene C: 50% C and 50% c.\n\nFor gene B: 50% B and 50% b.\n\nTherefore, the gametes from F1 will be:\n\nFor gene C: C and c.\n\nFor gene B: B and b.\n\nSo, combining both, the gametes are: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nThus, each F1 parent will produce these four types of gametes with equal probability (25%).\n\nWhen F1 \u00d7 F1 occurs, each gamete from F1 combines with each gamete from F1.\n\nSo, the Punnett square will have each F1 gamete pairing with the others.\n\nCalculating the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by its alleles for both genes. Since the genes are independent, the combination is:\n\n- Gene C: C (checkered) or c (plain)\n- Gene B: B (red) or b (brown)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Brown (c_B_)\n3. Plain Red (C_bb)\n4. Plain Brown (c_bb)\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nFor gene C, 25% C (checkered) and 75% c (plain).\nFor gene B, 25% B (red) and 75% b (brown).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\n1. Checkered Red: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown: (25% C) * (75% b) = 18.75%\n3. Plain Red: (75% c) * (25% B) = 18.75%\n4. Plain Brown: (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nRounded to whole numbers, the ratio is approximately 6 : 2 : 2 : 4.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption D: checkered red 1, brown 3, plain red 9, brown 3 \u2192 No.\nOption J: checkered red 2, brown 6, plain red 3, brown 1 \u2192 No.\nOption E: checkered red 3, brown 9, plain red 1, brown 3 \u2192 No.\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 This matches exactly except option A uses 6,2,6,2, whereas our calculation is 6,2,2,4. Closest is A, but let's see the options again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled from A to H, each with specific ratios. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which matches my calculated approximate values, assuming rounding. So, the closest match is option A.\n\nWait, but let's double-check the math.\n\nEach gene is independent, so:\n\nProbability of C being present (checkered) is 25%, and B being present (red) is 25%. So, C and B together is 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, C and b (brown) is 6.25%, b and B is 18.75%, and b and b is 18.75%.\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 6,2,2,4. So the ratio is 6:2:2:4, which corresponds to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "rollout": " Let's break it down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of Punnett squares and these genetic crosses.\n\nFirst, the setup: There are two birds being crossed. One is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are the dominant ones for checkingered and red. So, their genotype would be CC BB because they're both heterozygotes? Wait, no\u2014wait. Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So if it's checkered red, then each allele must be dominant for red. Since red is dominant over white, perhaps it's CC BB? Or maybe since it's checkered, that suggests some other trait, but in any case, for this problem, the key is the checkered and red traits. But actually, wait\u2014the first part says the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by c. So the bird's phenotype depends on both C/c and B/b. But the initial statement was about the checkered pattern being controlled by C and plain by c, but the actual description includes B and b for color. Hmm, but for this cross, we have two birds:\n\n- One is homozygous checkered red: probably CC BB because checkered is dominant and red is dominant over white, so both alleles must be dominant. So their genotype is CC BB.\n  \n- The other bird is plain brown: so the alleles are one dominant (B for brown) and one recessive (b for plain). So their genotype is bb or something else? Wait, no\u2014the bird is plain brown, so it must have at least one recessive allele. Since it's plain brown, the alleles are B and b. But wait, the bird is plain brown, which typically implies the presence of the recessive allele for color, so the genotype should be BB bb. Wait, but wait\u2014it's plain brown, meaning it's not showing the dominant brown trait. So the alleles are B and b. But for a bird, the presence of at least one dominant allele usually results in the dominant trait. So if the bird is plain brown, perhaps it has one dominant and one recessive allele, like Bb. Wait, but the problem states \"plain brown\" as the phenotype. So maybe the bird is Bb because it can exhibit brown but not necessarily have more than one dominant allele. Hmm, but let me think again. The question describes the traits as follows: checkered pattern is C, plain color is c, red is B, and brown is b. So the bird's phenotype depends on both C/c and B/b. So for the checkered pattern, it's C, and for the color, it's B. So the bird's phenotype will be determined by the combination of these.\n\nWait, but the initial problem is about the checkered pattern being controlled by C, and plain color by c. Then, the color is determined by B and b, where red is B and brown is b. So the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nSo when the bird is checkered red, that means C (dominant for checkered) and B (dominant for red). When it's checkered brown, it's C and b. Plain red would be c (since c is the recessive allele for plain color) and B, and plain brown would be c and b.\n\nNow, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb).\n\nWait, hold on. Because the first bird is CC BB. That would mean both alleles for checkered are dominant (so it's definitely checkered), and both alleles for color are dominant (so it's definitely red, not white or brown). But the problem said it's checkered red, which makes sense.\n\nThe second bird is plain brown, so it's cc bb. So the genotype is cc bb.\n\nSo the cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nNow, let's set up the Punnett square. We'll consider each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the checkered pattern (C/c):\n\n- Parent 1: CC (both C)\n- Parent 2: cc (one c)\n\nSo all offspring will get C from the first parent and c from the second. Therefore, all checkered birds will be Cc.\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\n- Parent 1: BB (both B)\n- Parent 2: bb (one b)\n\nSo all offspring will get B from the first parent and b from the second. Therefore, all red birds will be Bb.\n\nCombining both traits, each offspring will be Cc (checkered) and Bb (red). So the phenotypic ratio is 100% checkered red.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't match any of the options given. The options all mention different ratios, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't considering independent assortment, but instead using the standard dihybrid cross approach. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my understanding.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So for the checkered trait, it's always Cc, and for the color, it's always Bb. Therefore, each offspring will have both traits dominant, making them all checkered red.\n\nHmm, but none of the answer choices have a 100% checkered red. They all have a mix of checkered and plain, but based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Maybe the first bird is CC BB, meaning both alleles are dominant for both traits. The second bird is cc bb, meaning both alleles are recessive for both traits.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation would be Cc Bb, which would express as checkered red, since C is dominant for checkered, and B is dominant for red. All checkered birds would be red, and all plain birds would be white.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this either. Maybe I need to reconsider the cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the parents. Maybe the first bird is CC BB, meaning checkered pattern and red color (but both dominant), while the second bird is cc bb, meaning plain color and brown (both recessive). Therefore, the F1 would be Cc Bb, which is checkered red, as before.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to fit this scenario. Maybe I need to look at the F2 generation after selfing or doing another cross.\n\nWait, the question says: \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" So maybe the initial cross produces F1, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 is considered, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the cross as a dihybrid cross, considering both traits independently. Since each trait is governed by a separate pair of genes, we can use a Punnett square for each trait and then combine the results.\n\nFor the checkered pattern (C/c):\n\nParents: CC \u00d7 cc\n\nAll offspring will be Cc (since C from CC and c from cc, and cc contributes c).\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\nParents: BB \u00d7 bb\n\nAll offspring will be Bb.\n\nTherefore, combining both, each offspring is Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nBut according to the options provided, none seem to align with this outcome. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cross setup.\n\nWait, let me double-check the parents. The first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which would mean both alleles are dominant for checkered and red. So their genotype is CC BB.\n\nThe second bird is a plain brown bird, which would have one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele, so their genotype is Bb (or maybe bb? No, wait\u2014if it's plain brown, it must be at least one recessive allele, so Bb. But actually, since it's plain brown, the presence of the recessive allele is what determines the brown color. So their genotype could be Bb or bb? Wait, no\u2014in a typical bird, if the color is brown, it's at least one B allele, so Bb or BB. But since it's plain brown, which implies the presence of the recessive allele, so it's Bb.\n\nWait, but the problem says the second bird is plain brown. So their genotype is Bb.\n\nWait, but the first bird is CC BB, which would produce all Cc for both traits.\n\nWait, but then the F1 would be Cc Bb, which would be checkered red.\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the F1 is all checkered red, but maybe the parents are different.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not CC BB and cc bb, but rather CC Bb and cc bb, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the first bird is CC BB (checkered red), and the second bird is cc bb (plain brown). So their cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nIn that case, for the checkered trait, the parents are CC (C) and cc (c), so all offspring get Cc.\n\nFor the color trait, the parents are BB (B) and bb (b), so all offspring get Bb.\n\nThus, all offspring are Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nBut again, the options don't include this result. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the problem considers both traits together, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the parents' gametes.\n\nWait, for the first bird, CC BB, all gametes are CB.\n\nFor the second bird, cc bb, all gametes are cb.\n\nThen, the F1 would be Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 100% checkered red, but the options suggest different distributions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the F2 generation, which comes after selfing, but even so, if the parents are both Cc Bb, then F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb, leading to various combinations.\n\nBut the initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in all Cc Bb.\n\nWait, unless I'm misinterpreting the parents' genotypes. Perhaps the first bird is CC BB, and the second is cc Bb?\n\nNo, the problem clearly states the second bird is plain brown, so it's cc bb.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the F2 generation after selfing once, but that wouldn't make much sense because the F1 would already be all Cc Bb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC Bb and cc BB, but the problem states CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the first bird is CC BB, and the second is cc Bb, but that contradicts the problem's description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to proceed step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 all Cc for both traits (since both are dominant).\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 all Bb for both traits (since B is dominant and b is recessive).\n\nTherefore, F1 = Cc Bb \u2192 checkered red.\n\nPhenotype ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nBut the options do not reflect this. So perhaps the correct approach is different.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the problem is asking about the F2 generation, implying that the cross leads to a dihybrid situation, which requires the parents to produce a certain number of gametes.\n\nLet me try calculating the F2 generation.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, each parent (Cc Bb) would produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nEach gamete combines with the other parent's gamete, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut wait, since each trait is independently assorting, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes depending on the combination of traits.\n\nHowever, the problem states to consider the F2 generation, so perhaps I need to list the phenotypes and their counts.\n\nWait, but the problem also asks for the genotypic and phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me summarize:\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (all Cc for both traits)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (all Bb for both traits)\n\nF1: Cc Bb (checkered red)\n\nPhenotype ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nGenotypic ratio: 100% Cc Bb.\n\nPhenotypic ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nBut since the options don't reflect this, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not CC BB and cc bb, but rather CC Bb and cc bb.\n\nWait, that would change the calculation.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC Bb and Parent 2 is cc bb.\n\nThen, for the checkered trait:\n- Parent 1: CC (C) and Parent 2: cc (c) \u2192 all Cc.\n\nFor the color trait:\n- Parent 1: B (from CC) and B (from Bb?), wait no. Wait, in a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes one allele per trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should treat each trait separately.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I should model the cross differently. Let me try to outline the steps properly.\n\nAssuming the parents are CC BB and cc bb.\n\nF1: Cc Bb \u2192 checkered red.\n\nPhenotype ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nGenotypic ratio: 100% Cc Bb.\n\nPhenotypic ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nBut the options don't include this, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not considering the F1 as the cross, but rather the F2 generation after selfing once.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem.\n\nSuppose Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb.\n\nCross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb = F1: Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 = F2.\n\nEach F1 individual is Cc Bb.\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, each trait is independently assorting.\n\nSo for the checkered trait (C/c):\n- Each parent gives C or c.\n- 25% C, 25% c.\n\nSimilarly for the color trait (B/b):\n- Each parent gives B or b.\n- 25% B, 25% b.\n\nSince the traits are independent, the combined probabilities for F2 are 9:3:3:1.\n\nSo:\n\n- 9/16 of Cc Bb (checkered red)\n- 3/16 of Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- 3/16 of Cc Bb (checkered white?) Wait, no\u2014because B is dominant, so if both are B, the bird is brown, not white. Wait, no\u2014the B is brown, b is plain. So, for color, B is dominant, so all Cc Bb individuals are brown.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions red and brown, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the color is determined by B and b, where B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (plain). So, regardless of the checkered trait, if the bird is brown (B present), it's brown, and if it's plain (b present), it's plain.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red: all Cc Bb (100%)\n- Checkered brown: all Cc Bb (3/16)\n- Checkered white: impossible because B is dominant, so all Cc Bb are brown.\nWait, but in reality, if you have B and b, the bird is brown, not white. So all F2 individuals are either brown or plain, depending on the color.\n\nWait, but in the F2, the color would be:\n\n- Brown: 9/16\n- Plain: 7/16\n\nBecause:\n\n- C (from Cc) + B (from Bb): brown\n- C + b: brown\n- c + B: brown\n- c + b: plain\n\nSo the color distribution is 9:7.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions red and brown, which might imply that checkered affects the color expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the traits. Let me clarify:\n\nCheckered (C/c) and color (B/b):\n\n- Checkered is determined by C and c.\n- Color is determined by B and b.\n\nSo, each bird has both traits expressed.\n\nWhen a bird is checkered (Cc) and color is red (BB), it's checkered red.\n\nColor is determined by B and b, so:\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is plain.\n\nSo, in terms of colors:\n\n- Brown (B_)\n- Plain (b_)\n\nTherefore, in the F2:\n\n- All Cc Bb are brown (since B is present).\n- All c c b b are plain.\n\nWait, but the F2 from a dihybrid cross would be:\n\n- Checkered red: Cc Bb \u2192 brown (since B is present)\n- Checkered brown: Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n- Checkered white: impossible here because B is dominant, so all checkered birds are brown.\nWait, no\u2014wait, the bird is Cc Bb, which is brown due to B. So all checkered birds are brown.\n\nTherefore, in the F2:\n\n- 100% checkered brown (as Cc Bb is brown)\n- 0% checkered red\n- 0% checkered white\n\nAnd:\n\n- 9/16 brown (all checkered)\n- 7/16 plain (all non-checkered, i.e., cc bb)\n\nBut the problem mentions red and brown, so perhaps the focus is on the color aspect, ignoring the checkered effect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating both traits as separate, leading to a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nBut the options provided don't match this.\n\nWait, let me see the options again:\n\nA.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's break it down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of Punnett squares and these genetic crosses.\n\nFirst, the setup: There are two birds being crossed. One is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are the dominant ones for checkingered and red. So, their genotype would be CC BB because they're both heterozygotes? Wait, no\u2014wait. Homozygous means both alleles are the same. So if it's checkered red, then each allele must be dominant for red. Since red is dominant over white, perhaps it's CC BB? Or maybe since it's checkered, that suggests some other trait, but in any case, for this problem, the key is the checkered and red traits. But actually, wait\u2014the first part says the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by c. So the bird's phenotype depends on both C/c and B/b. But the initial statement was about the checkered pattern being controlled by C and plain by c, but the actual description includes B and b for color. Hmm, but for this cross, we have two birds:\n\n- One is homozygous checkered red: probably CC BB because checkered is dominant and red is dominant over white, so both alleles must be dominant. So their genotype is CC BB.\n  \n- The other bird is plain brown: so the alleles are one dominant (B for brown) and one recessive (b for plain). So their genotype is bb or something else? Wait, no\u2014the bird is plain brown, so it must have at least one recessive allele. Since it's plain brown, the alleles are B and b. But wait, the bird is plain brown, which typically implies the presence of the recessive allele for color, so the genotype should be BB bb. Wait, but wait\u2014it's plain brown, meaning it's not showing the dominant brown trait. So the alleles are B and b. But for a bird, the presence of at least one dominant allele usually results in the dominant trait. So if the bird is plain brown, perhaps it has one dominant and one recessive allele, like Bb. Wait, but the problem states \"plain brown\" as the phenotype. So maybe the bird is Bb because it can exhibit brown but not necessarily have more than one dominant allele. Hmm, but let me think again. The question describes the traits as follows: checkered pattern is C, plain color is c, red is B, and brown is b. So the bird's phenotype depends on both C/c and B/b. So for the checkered pattern, it's C, and for the color, it's B. So the bird's phenotype will be determined by the combination of these.\n\nWait, but the initial problem is about the checkered pattern being controlled by C, and plain color by c. Then, the color is determined by B and b, where red is B and brown is b. So the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nSo when the bird is checkered red, that means C (dominant for checkered) and B (dominant for red). When it's checkered brown, it's C and b. Plain red would be c (since c is the recessive allele for plain color) and B, and plain brown would be c and b.\n\nNow, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb).\n\nWait, hold on. Because the first bird is CC BB. That would mean both alleles for checkered are dominant (so it's definitely checkered), and both alleles for color are dominant (so it's definitely red, not white or brown). But the problem said it's checkered red, which makes sense.\n\nThe second bird is plain brown, so it's cc bb. So the genotype is cc bb.\n\nSo the cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nNow, let's set up the Punnett square. We'll consider each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the checkered pattern (C/c):\n\n- Parent 1: CC (both C)\n- Parent 2: cc (one c)\n\nSo all offspring will get C from the first parent and c from the second. Therefore, all checkered birds will be Cc.\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\n- Parent 1: BB (both B)\n- Parent 2: bb (one b)\n\nSo all offspring will get B from the first parent and b from the second. Therefore, all red birds will be Bb.\n\nCombining both traits, each offspring will be Cc (checkered) and Bb (red). So the phenotypic ratio is 100% checkered red.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't match any of the options given. The options all mention different ratios, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't considering independent assortment, but instead using the standard dihybrid cross approach. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my understanding.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So for the checkered trait, it's always Cc, and for the color, it's always Bb. Therefore, each offspring will have both traits dominant, making them all checkered red.\n\nHmm, but none of the answer choices have a 100% checkered red. They all have a mix of checkered and plain, but based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Maybe the first bird is CC BB, meaning both alleles are dominant for both traits. The second bird is cc bb, meaning both alleles are recessive for both traits.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation would be Cc Bb, which would express as checkered red, since C is dominant for checkered, and B is dominant for red. All checkered birds would be red, and all plain birds would be white.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this either. Maybe I need to reconsider the cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the parents. Maybe the first bird is CC BB, meaning checkered pattern and red color (but both dominant), while the second bird is cc bb, meaning plain color and brown (both recessive). Therefore, the F1 would be Cc Bb, which is checkered red, as before.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to fit this scenario. Maybe I need to look at the F2 generation after selfing or doing another cross.\n\nWait, the question says: \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation.\" So maybe the initial cross produces F1, and then F1 \u00d7 F1 is considered, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the cross as a dihybrid cross, considering both traits independently. Since each trait is governed by a separate pair of genes, we can use a Punnett square for each trait and then combine the results.\n\nFor the checkered pattern (C/c):\n\nParents: CC \u00d7 cc\n\nAll offspring will be Cc (since C from CC and c from cc, and cc contributes c).\n\nFor the color (B/b):\n\nParents: BB \u00d7 bb\n\nAll offspring will be Bb.\n\nTherefore, combining both, each offspring is Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nBut according to the options provided, none seem to align with this outcome. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cross setup.\n\nWait, let me double-check the parents. The first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which would mean both alleles are dominant for checkered and red. So their genotype is CC BB.\n\nThe second bird is a plain brown bird, which would have one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele, so their genotype is Bb (or maybe bb? No, wait\u2014if it's plain brown, it must be at least one recessive allele, so Bb. But actually, since it's plain brown, the presence of the recessive allele is what determines the brown color. So their genotype could be Bb or bb? Wait, no\u2014in a typical bird, if the color is brown, it's at least one B allele, so Bb or BB. But since it's plain brown, which implies the presence of the recessive allele, so it's Bb.\n\nWait, but the problem says the second bird is plain brown. So their genotype is Bb.\n\nWait, but the first bird is CC BB, which would produce all Cc for both traits.\n\nWait, but then the F1 would be Cc Bb, which would be checkered red.\n\nBut again, none of the options reflect this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the F1 is all checkered red, but maybe the parents are different.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not CC BB and cc bb, but rather CC Bb and cc bb, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the first bird is CC BB (checkered red), and the second bird is cc bb (plain brown). So their cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nIn that case, for the checkered trait, the parents are CC (C) and cc (c), so all offspring get Cc.\n\nFor the color trait, the parents are BB (B) and bb (b), so all offspring get Bb.\n\nThus, all offspring are Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nBut again, the options don't include this result. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the problem considers both traits together, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the parents' gametes.\n\nWait, for the first bird, CC BB, all gametes are CB.\n\nFor the second bird, cc bb, all gametes are cb.\n\nThen, the F1 would be Cc Bb, which is checkered red.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 100% checkered red, but the options suggest different distributions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the F2 generation, which comes after selfing, but even so, if the parents are both Cc Bb, then F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb, leading to various combinations.\n\nBut the initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in all Cc Bb.\n\nWait, unless I'm misinterpreting the parents' genotypes. Perhaps the first bird is CC BB, and the second is cc Bb?\n\nNo, the problem clearly states the second bird is plain brown, so it's cc bb.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the F2 generation after selfing once, but that wouldn't make much sense because the F1 would already be all Cc Bb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC Bb and cc BB, but the problem states CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the first bird is CC BB, and the second is cc Bb, but that contradicts the problem's description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to proceed step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 all Cc for both traits (since both are dominant).\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 all Bb for both traits (since B is dominant and b is recessive).\n\nTherefore, F1 = Cc Bb \u2192 checkered red.\n\nPhenotype ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nBut the options do not reflect this. So perhaps the correct approach is different.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, but the problem is asking about the F2 generation, implying that the cross leads to a dihybrid situation, which requires the parents to produce a certain number of gametes.\n\nLet me try calculating the F2 generation.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, each parent (Cc Bb) would produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nEach gamete combines with the other parent's gamete, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nBut wait, since each trait is independently assorting, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes depending on the combination of traits.\n\nHowever, the problem states to consider the F2 generation, so perhaps I need to list the phenotypes and their counts.\n\nWait, but the problem also asks for the genotypic and phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me summarize:\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (all Cc for both traits)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (all Bb for both traits)\n\nF1: Cc Bb (checkered red)\n\nPhenotype ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nGenotypic ratio: 100% Cc Bb.\n\nPhenotypic ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nBut since the options don't reflect this, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not CC BB and cc bb, but rather CC Bb and cc bb.\n\nWait, that would change the calculation.\n\nIf Parent 1 is CC Bb and Parent 2 is cc bb.\n\nThen, for the checkered trait:\n- Parent 1: CC (C) and Parent 2: cc (c) \u2192 all Cc.\n\nFor the color trait:\n- Parent 1: B (from CC) and B (from Bb?), wait no. Wait, in a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes one allele per trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should treat each trait separately.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I should model the cross differently. Let me try to outline the steps properly.\n\nAssuming the parents are CC BB and cc bb.\n\nF1: Cc Bb \u2192 checkered red.\n\nPhenotype ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nGenotypic ratio: 100% Cc Bb.\n\nPhenotypic ratio: 100% checkered red.\n\nBut the options don't include this, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not considering the F1 as the cross, but rather the F2 generation after selfing once.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem.\n\nSuppose Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb.\n\nCross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb = F1: Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 = F2.\n\nEach F1 individual is Cc Bb.\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, each trait is independently assorting.\n\nSo for the checkered trait (C/c):\n- Each parent gives C or c.\n- 25% C, 25% c.\n\nSimilarly for the color trait (B/b):\n- Each parent gives B or b.\n- 25% B, 25% b.\n\nSince the traits are independent, the combined probabilities for F2 are 9:3:3:1.\n\nSo:\n\n- 9/16 of Cc Bb (checkered red)\n- 3/16 of Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- 3/16 of Cc Bb (checkered white?) Wait, no\u2014because B is dominant, so if both are B, the bird is brown, not white. Wait, no\u2014the B is brown, b is plain. So, for color, B is dominant, so all Cc Bb individuals are brown.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions red and brown, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the color is determined by B and b, where B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (plain). So, regardless of the checkered trait, if the bird is brown (B present), it's brown, and if it's plain (b present), it's plain.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered red: all Cc Bb (100%)\n- Checkered brown: all Cc Bb (3/16)\n- Checkered white: impossible because B is dominant, so all Cc Bb are brown.\nWait, but in reality, if you have B and b, the bird is brown, not white. So all F2 individuals are either brown or plain, depending on the color.\n\nWait, but in the F2, the color would be:\n\n- Brown: 9/16\n- Plain: 7/16\n\nBecause:\n\n- C (from Cc) + B (from Bb): brown\n- C + b: brown\n- c + B: brown\n- c + b: plain\n\nSo the color distribution is 9:7.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions red and brown, which might imply that checkered affects the color expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the traits. Let me clarify:\n\nCheckered (C/c) and color (B/b):\n\n- Checkered is determined by C and c.\n- Color is determined by B and b.\n\nSo, each bird has both traits expressed.\n\nWhen a bird is checkered (Cc) and color is red (BB), it's checkered red.\n\nColor is determined by B and b, so:\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is plain.\n\nSo, in terms of colors:\n\n- Brown (B_)\n- Plain (b_)\n\nTherefore, in the F2:\n\n- All Cc Bb are brown (since B is present).\n- All c c b b are plain.\n\nWait, but the F2 from a dihybrid cross would be:\n\n- Checkered red: Cc Bb \u2192 brown (since B is present)\n- Checkered brown: Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n- Checkered white: impossible here because B is dominant, so all checkered birds are brown.\nWait, no\u2014wait, the bird is Cc Bb, which is brown due to B. So all checkered birds are brown.\n\nTherefore, in the F2:\n\n- 100% checkered brown (as Cc Bb is brown)\n- 0% checkered red\n- 0% checkered white\n\nAnd:\n\n- 9/16 brown (all checkered)\n- 7/16 plain (all non-checkered, i.e., cc bb)\n\nBut the problem mentions red and brown, so perhaps the focus is on the color aspect, ignoring the checkered effect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simplified, treating both traits as separate, leading to a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nBut the options provided don't match this.\n\nWait, let me see the options again:\n\nA.

    "chunk_resampled": "Let's see what it says.",
    "rollout": " Let's see what it says.\n\nWe have two birds crossing. One is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB because they're both dominant for both genes. So that bird is CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown one, meaning their genotype is cc bb since those are recessive for both genes.\n\nNow, we need to do an adihybrid cross between these two birds. Adihybrid refers to crossing two heterozygotes, right? Wait, but here one is homozygous. Hmm, maybe I should still treat them as separate parents. But wait, in a typical adihybrid cross, you usually have two different parents each contributing gametes. Here, though, one parent is already homozygous. Maybe I can think of it as a dihybrid cross where one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb.\n\nBut let me make sure about the cross setup first. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the possible gametes from the first parent would all be CB because they're homozygous for both dominant traits. And the second parent, being cc bb, would produce gametes cb, cB, and cb again, making the four possible combinations when crossed.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, if one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, then the F1 generation would result from each parent contributing either CB or cb. So the F1 gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, the F1 individuals would be Cc Bb and Cc cb, but wait, no, because each parent contributes one gamete. So each F1 bird gets either CB or cb from each parent. So the F1 individuals would be Cc Bb (from CB + CB), Cc cb (from CB + cb), cB Bb (from cb + CB), and cB cb (from cb + cb). \n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because each parent contributes one allele per gene. So for the first gene (dominant C and recessive c), the first parent (CC BB) will always give C, and the second parent (cc bb) will always give c. Similarly, for the second gene (dominant B and recessive b), the first parent gives B and the second gives b. So the F1 would be Cc Bb, Cc bb, cB Bb, and cB bb. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 should be Cc Bb, Cc bb, cB Bb, cB bb.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the cross between CC BB and cc bb, each parent produces only one type of gamete because they're homozygous. So the F1 would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. No, wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so each gamete from the first parent has C and B, while each gamete from the second parent has c and b. So the F1 birds would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. Wait, no\u2014it depends on how the alleles combine. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since the first parent is CC BB, they'll contribute C and B. The second parent is cc bb, so they'll contribute c and b. So the F1 would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. But wait, that seems off because the parents are different.\n\nActually, no\u2014the cross between CC BB and cc bb would result in F1 birds that are Cc Bb and Cc bb. Wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me try to structure it properly. \n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 will produce gametes: C (for C) and B (for B)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 will produce gametes: c (for c) and b (for b)\n\nSo each F1 bird will get one allele from each parent:\n- From Parent 1: C (for C) and B (for B)\n- From Parent 2: c (for c) and b (for b)\n\nTherefore, each F1 bird's genotype would be:\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B)\n- Cc (for C) and bb (for B)\n- cc (for c) and Bb (for B)\n- cc (for c) and bb (for B)\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. Or perhaps more accurately, the F1 would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. \n\nWait, no\u2014if the first parent is CC BB, then any gamete they produce will have C (since they're homozygous for C) and B (for B). The second parent is cc bb, so any gamete they produce will have c (for c) and b (for b). So each F1 bird gets C (from CC BB) and c (from cc bb), resulting in Cc for the first gene. Similarly, B (from CC BB) and b (from cc bb) results in Bb for the second gene. Therefore, all F1 birds would be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the parents are different. Oh, wait\u2014I think I'm getting confused. The cross is between CC BB and cc bb, so each parent produces gametes based on their own genes. The F1 would be the combination of the alleles from each parent. So for each gene:\n\nGene 1 (C/c):\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 will produce C gametes.\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 will produce c gametes.\n- So F1 will have C and c \u2192 genotype Cc.\n\nGene 2 (B/b):\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 will produce B gametes.\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 will produce b gametes.\n- So F1 will have B and b \u2192 genotype Bb.\n\nSo all F1 birds are Cc Bb. That makes sense because both parents are homozygous for their respective traits. So the F1 is a monohybrid cross.\n\nNow, the next part is to determine the F2 generation. Since F1 is Cc Bb, which is a monohybrid cross, the F2 would follow Mendelian ratios. But wait, F1 is from a cross of two different parents, so the F2 might be affected by incomplete dominance or something else.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 itself is from a cross between CC BB and cc bb, so each F1 bird is Cc Bb. When we cross two F1 birds (Cc Bb x Cc Bb), the F2 would be calculated using the Punnett square approach.\n\nLet me outline the F1 as Cc Bb. When they self-fertilize (or in this case, the F1 cross themselves?), the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor each gene, the possible gametes are C, c, B, and b, but since it's a monohybrid cross, the F2 would have a 3:1 ratio for each gene independently.\n\nWait, no\u2014in reality, each gene is independent, so the overall F2 would be a dihybrid cross, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, since the F1 is Cc Bb, crossing them would lead to:\n\nEach gene segregates as follows:\n- For Gene 1 (C/c): 3/4 chance of C and 1/4 chance of c.\n- For Gene 2 (B/b): 3/4 chance of B and 1/4 chance of b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio across the four phenotypes. But considering the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, some phenotypes might overlap.\n\nWait, but in our case, the F1 is Cc Bb, which is a monohybrid cross. However, the original parents were homozygous, so the F1 is a hybrid, and the F2 would reflect the usual dihybrid ratios.\n\nAlternatively, since the F1 is from a cross of two different parents (CC BB and cc bb), the F2 might not follow the same ratios because each parent contributes gametes based on their own genetic makeup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. The cross is between CC BB and cc bb, which results in all F1 birds being Cc Bb. Then, F1 x F1 would yield F2, which follows a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes two alleles for each gene. So for Gene 1 (C/c):\n\nEach F1 bird gives either C or c. The probability of C is 3/4 and c is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for Gene 2 (B/b):\n\nEach F1 bird gives either B or b. Probability of B is 3/4, b is 1/4.\n\nThe F2 would then have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypic classes. But some phenotypes may be combined due to overlapping dominant traits.\n\nWait, but in the initial question, the F2 phenotype ratios are given as options A through H. So I need to calculate the expected phenotypes based on the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but in the initial cross, the F1 are Cc Bb, which are Checkered Brown. Then, F2 would be derived from F1 x F1.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes would depend on the dihybrid ratios.\n\nCalculating the F2 phenotypic ratio:\n\nFor Gene 1 (C/c):\n- CC: 3/4\n- Cc: 1/4\n- cc: 0 (since F2 doesn't have cc in dihybrid cross unless it's selfing, but in this case, F2 comes from F1 x F1, which is a cross of Cc Bb x Cc Bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 comes from F1 x F1, so each gene segregates as C (3/4), c (1/4), B (3/4), b (1/4).\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 9/16 chance\n2. CC Bb \u2192 3/16 chance\n3. cc BB \u2192 3/16 chance\n4. cc Bb \u2192 1/16 chance\n5. CC bb \u2192 3/16 chance\n6. CC bb \u2013 Wait, no, each gene is independent. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- cc BB (Plain Red)\n- cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, but in the F2, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. So the total is 16 parts. Therefore, the proportions are 9 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that's exactly the opposite of what I just got.\n\nOption E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which also doesn't match.\n\nHmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 isn't Cc Bb after all. Let me re-examine the cross.\n\nWait, the cross is between CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (homozygous plain brown). So the F1 should be Cc Bb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nYes, so F1 is Cc Bb. Then, F2 is F1 x F1, which would give us the dihybrid ratios.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, translating to:\n\n- 9 Checkered Red (CC BB)\n- 3 Checkered Brown (CC Bb)\n- 3 Plain Red (cc BB)\n- 1 Plain Brown (cc Bb)\n\nBut none of the answer choices directly say this. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A to H don't include 9 Checkered Red; instead, Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, etc. None of them match my calculation. Did I misunderstand the parents' cross?\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, but the F1s are recombinant or something else. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, no\u2014the cross is straightforward. Two parents, each producing four gametes, resulting in four F1 birds. All F1 are Cc Bb, so the F2 is generated by F1 x F1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is about the F2 generation relative to the initial parents. Maybe I'm supposed to consider the F2 of the F1 x F1 cross, but I think that's what I did.\n\nGiven that, none of the options match my expectation. Let me double-check the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nThat's the reverse of what I had. Is there a way that could be correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nFor each gene, the segregation is:\n\n- Gene 1 (C/c): 3/4 C, 1/4 c\n- Gene 2 (B/b): 3/4 B, 1/4 b\n\nThe four phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. CC BB: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. CC Bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. cc BB: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. cc Bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown.\n\nBut looking at the options, none have 9 Checkered Red. Instead, option J has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, etc., which sums to 8, whereas the correct sum should be 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 from the initial parents, which would indeed have 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the initial cross. Maybe the cross isn't between CC BB and cc bb, but rather between CC BB and cc bb, but the F1s are different.\n\nWait, no, that's what I thought earlier. CC BB and cc bb would produce F1 as Cc Bb, and F2 as dihybrid.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation from the F1 x F1 cross, which is correct.\n\nWait, but according to the options, none match my calculation. Let me check option D again.\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nThat's the inverse of what I have. Maybe I misread the question regarding the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypic determination.\n\nRed color is controlled by dominant allele B, and brown by recessive b. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: Both dominant (C and B present)\n- Checkered Brown: C dominant, b recessive\n- Plain Red: c dominant, B absent?\nWait, no, because if B is recessive, then brown would be expressed regardless of B. Wait, no\u2014the actual phenotypes depend on whether the traits are expressed.\n\nWait, red is B, brown is b. So:\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is red.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is brown.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of dominant C affects the color:\n\n- C_: Checkered\n- cc_: Plain\n\nSo the four phenotypes are determined by:\n\n1. Presence of C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Presence of C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. absence of C and B \u2192 Plain Red\n4. absence of C and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect that. Let me check option J again.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nSumming up: 2+6=8, 6+2=8. Not 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the F2. Let me verify the dihybrid ratios.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the possible phenotypic outcomes are 9:3:3:1. So:\n\n- 9 Checkered Red\n- 3 Checkered Brown\n- 3 Plain Red\n- 1 Plain Brown\n\nIf I add these, it equals 16, which matches the total number of offspring.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them match 9:3:3:1 except option D, which reverses the numbers. So perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the cross.\n\nWait, going back to the cross setup. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their F1 would be Cc Bb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, the F2 would come from F1 x F1, which is a dihybrid cross.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, as previously determined.\n\nHowever, the options don't have this ratio. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's exactly the inverse. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the F2 generation is not from F1 x F1, but from the original parents. That is, starting with CC BB and cc bb, generating F1 (which is Cc Bb), then F2 as F1 x F1. Which brings us back to the same situation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 of the original parents, but that wouldn't make much sense because F1 would be the result of F1 x F1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the cross setup. Maybe the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, and the F1 is Cc Bb, and the F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's see what it says.\n\nWe have two birds crossing. One is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype must be CC BB because they're both dominant for both genes. So that bird is CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown one, meaning their genotype is cc bb since those are recessive for both genes.\n\nNow, we need to do an adihybrid cross between these two birds. Adihybrid refers to crossing two heterozygotes, right? Wait, but here one is homozygous. Hmm, maybe I should still treat them as separate parents. But wait, in a typical adihybrid cross, you usually have two different parents each contributing gametes. Here, though, one parent is already homozygous. Maybe I can think of it as a dihybrid cross where one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb.\n\nBut let me make sure about the cross setup first. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the possible gametes from the first parent would all be CB because they're homozygous for both dominant traits. And the second parent, being cc bb, would produce gametes cb, cB, and cb again, making the four possible combinations when crossed.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, if one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, then the F1 generation would result from each parent contributing either CB or cb. So the F1 gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, the F1 individuals would be Cc Bb and Cc cb, but wait, no, because each parent contributes one gamete. So each F1 bird gets either CB or cb from each parent. So the F1 individuals would be Cc Bb (from CB + CB), Cc cb (from CB + cb), cB Bb (from cb + CB), and cB cb (from cb + cb). \n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because each parent contributes one allele per gene. So for the first gene (dominant C and recessive c), the first parent (CC BB) will always give C, and the second parent (cc bb) will always give c. Similarly, for the second gene (dominant B and recessive b), the first parent gives B and the second gives b. So the F1 would be Cc Bb, Cc bb, cB Bb, and cB bb. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 should be Cc Bb, Cc bb, cB Bb, cB bb.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the cross between CC BB and cc bb, each parent produces only one type of gamete because they're homozygous. So the F1 would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. No, wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so each gamete from the first parent has C and B, while each gamete from the second parent has c and b. So the F1 birds would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. Wait, no\u2014it depends on how the alleles combine. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since the first parent is CC BB, they'll contribute C and B. The second parent is cc bb, so they'll contribute c and b. So the F1 would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. But wait, that seems off because the parents are different.\n\nActually, no\u2014the cross between CC BB and cc bb would result in F1 birds that are Cc Bb and Cc bb. Wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me try to structure it properly. \n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 will produce gametes: C (for C) and B (for B)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 will produce gametes: c (for c) and b (for b)\n\nSo each F1 bird will get one allele from each parent:\n- From Parent 1: C (for C) and B (for B)\n- From Parent 2: c (for c) and b (for b)\n\nTherefore, each F1 bird's genotype would be:\n- Cc (for C) and Bb (for B)\n- Cc (for C) and bb (for B)\n- cc (for c) and Bb (for B)\n- cc (for c) and bb (for B)\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. Or perhaps more accurately, the F1 would be Cc Bb and Cc bb. \n\nWait, no\u2014if the first parent is CC BB, then any gamete they produce will have C (since they're homozygous for C) and B (for B). The second parent is cc bb, so any gamete they produce will have c (for c) and b (for b). So each F1 bird gets C (from CC BB) and c (from cc bb), resulting in Cc for the first gene. Similarly, B (from CC BB) and b (from cc bb) results in Bb for the second gene. Therefore, all F1 birds would be Cc Bb.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the parents are different. Oh, wait\u2014I think I'm getting confused. The cross is between CC BB and cc bb, so each parent produces gametes based on their own genes. The F1 would be the combination of the alleles from each parent. So for each gene:\n\nGene 1 (C/c):\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 will produce C gametes.\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 will produce c gametes.\n- So F1 will have C and c \u2192 genotype Cc.\n\nGene 2 (B/b):\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 will produce B gametes.\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 will produce b gametes.\n- So F1 will have B and b \u2192 genotype Bb.\n\nSo all F1 birds are Cc Bb. That makes sense because both parents are homozygous for their respective traits. So the F1 is a monohybrid cross.\n\nNow, the next part is to determine the F2 generation. Since F1 is Cc Bb, which is a monohybrid cross, the F2 would follow Mendelian ratios. But wait, F1 is from a cross of two different parents, so the F2 might be affected by incomplete dominance or something else.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 itself is from a cross between CC BB and cc bb, so each F1 bird is Cc Bb. When we cross two F1 birds (Cc Bb x Cc Bb), the F2 would be calculated using the Punnett square approach.\n\nLet me outline the F1 as Cc Bb. When they self-fertilize (or in this case, the F1 cross themselves?), the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor each gene, the possible gametes are C, c, B, and b, but since it's a monohybrid cross, the F2 would have a 3:1 ratio for each gene independently.\n\nWait, no\u2014in reality, each gene is independent, so the overall F2 would be a dihybrid cross, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, since the F1 is Cc Bb, crossing them would lead to:\n\nEach gene segregates as follows:\n- For Gene 1 (C/c): 3/4 chance of C and 1/4 chance of c.\n- For Gene 2 (B/b): 3/4 chance of B and 1/4 chance of b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio across the four phenotypes. But considering the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, some phenotypes might overlap.\n\nWait, but in our case, the F1 is Cc Bb, which is a monohybrid cross. However, the original parents were homozygous, so the F1 is a hybrid, and the F2 would reflect the usual dihybrid ratios.\n\nAlternatively, since the F1 is from a cross of two different parents (CC BB and cc bb), the F2 might not follow the same ratios because each parent contributes gametes based on their own genetic makeup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. The cross is between CC BB and cc bb, which results in all F1 birds being Cc Bb. Then, F1 x F1 would yield F2, which follows a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes two alleles for each gene. So for Gene 1 (C/c):\n\nEach F1 bird gives either C or c. The probability of C is 3/4 and c is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for Gene 2 (B/b):\n\nEach F1 bird gives either B or b. Probability of B is 3/4, b is 1/4.\n\nThe F2 would then have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypic classes. But some phenotypes may be combined due to overlapping dominant traits.\n\nWait, but in the initial question, the F2 phenotype ratios are given as options A through H. So I need to calculate the expected phenotypes based on the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but in the initial cross, the F1 are Cc Bb, which are Checkered Brown. Then, F2 would be derived from F1 x F1.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes would depend on the dihybrid ratios.\n\nCalculating the F2 phenotypic ratio:\n\nFor Gene 1 (C/c):\n- CC: 3/4\n- Cc: 1/4\n- cc: 0 (since F2 doesn't have cc in dihybrid cross unless it's selfing, but in this case, F2 comes from F1 x F1, which is a cross of Cc Bb x Cc Bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 comes from F1 x F1, so each gene segregates as C (3/4), c (1/4), B (3/4), b (1/4).\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 9/16 chance\n2. CC Bb \u2192 3/16 chance\n3. cc BB \u2192 3/16 chance\n4. cc Bb \u2192 1/16 chance\n5. CC bb \u2192 3/16 chance\n6. CC bb \u2013 Wait, no, each gene is independent. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- cc BB (Plain Red)\n- cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, but in the F2, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. So the total is 16 parts. Therefore, the proportions are 9 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that's exactly the opposite of what I just got.\n\nOption E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which also doesn't match.\n\nHmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 isn't Cc Bb after all. Let me re-examine the cross.\n\nWait, the cross is between CC BB (homozygous checkered red) and cc bb (homozygous plain brown). So the F1 should be Cc Bb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nYes, so F1 is Cc Bb. Then, F2 is F1 x F1, which would give us the dihybrid ratios.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, translating to:\n\n- 9 Checkered Red (CC BB)\n- 3 Checkered Brown (CC Bb)\n- 3 Plain Red (cc BB)\n- 1 Plain Brown (cc Bb)\n\nBut none of the answer choices directly say this. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A to H don't include 9 Checkered Red; instead, Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, etc. None of them match my calculation. Did I misunderstand the parents' cross?\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, but the F1s are recombinant or something else. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, no\u2014the cross is straightforward. Two parents, each producing four gametes, resulting in four F1 birds. All F1 are Cc Bb, so the F2 is generated by F1 x F1.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is about the F2 generation relative to the initial parents. Maybe I'm supposed to consider the F2 of the F1 x F1 cross, but I think that's what I did.\n\nGiven that, none of the options match my expectation. Let me double-check the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nThat's the reverse of what I had. Is there a way that could be correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nFor each gene, the segregation is:\n\n- Gene 1 (C/c): 3/4 C, 1/4 c\n- Gene 2 (B/b): 3/4 B, 1/4 b\n\nThe four phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. CC BB: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. CC Bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. cc BB: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. cc Bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown.\n\nBut looking at the options, none have 9 Checkered Red. Instead, option J has checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, etc., which sums to 8, whereas the correct sum should be 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 from the initial parents, which would indeed have 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the initial cross. Maybe the cross isn't between CC BB and cc bb, but rather between CC BB and cc bb, but the F1s are different.\n\nWait, no, that's what I thought earlier. CC BB and cc bb would produce F1 as Cc Bb, and F2 as dihybrid.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation from the F1 x F1 cross, which is correct.\n\nWait, but according to the options, none match my calculation. Let me check option D again.\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nThat's the inverse of what I have. Maybe I misread the question regarding the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypic determination.\n\nRed color is controlled by dominant allele B, and brown by recessive b. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: Both dominant (C and B present)\n- Checkered Brown: C dominant, b recessive\n- Plain Red: c dominant, B absent?\nWait, no, because if B is recessive, then brown would be expressed regardless of B. Wait, no\u2014the actual phenotypes depend on whether the traits are expressed.\n\nWait, red is B, brown is b. So:\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is red.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is brown.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of dominant C affects the color:\n\n- C_: Checkered\n- cc_: Plain\n\nSo the four phenotypes are determined by:\n\n1. Presence of C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Presence of C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. absence of C and B \u2192 Plain Red\n4. absence of C and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect that. Let me check option J again.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nSumming up: 2+6=8, 6+2=8. Not 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the F2. Let me verify the dihybrid ratios.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the possible phenotypic outcomes are 9:3:3:1. So:\n\n- 9 Checkered Red\n- 3 Checkered Brown\n- 3 Plain Red\n- 1 Plain Brown\n\nIf I add these, it equals 16, which matches the total number of offspring.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them match 9:3:3:1 except option D, which reverses the numbers. So perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the cross.\n\nWait, going back to the cross setup. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their F1 would be Cc Bb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, the F2 would come from F1 x F1, which is a dihybrid cross.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, as previously determined.\n\nHowever, the options don't have this ratio. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's exactly the inverse. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the F2 generation is not from F1 x F1, but from the original parents. That is, starting with CC BB and cc bb, generating F1 (which is Cc Bb), then F2 as F1 x F1. Which brings us back to the same situation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F2 of the original parents, but that wouldn't make much sense because F1 would be the result of F1 x F1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the cross setup. Maybe the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, and the F1 is Cc Bb, and the F",

We need to determine the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on their genetic makeup. The options are given from A to J, each with different ratios.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the parents' genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\n- Homozygous dominant for both genes.\n- So, they're definitely going to produce only one type of gamete: C and B.\n- Therefore, all F1 will be CB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb\n- Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n- They can only produce gametes that are cc and bb.\n- So, all F1 will be cb.\n\nWait, but the F1s would be a cross between a purebred CB and another CB? No, wait, the parents themselves are F1 because they're not yet crossed. Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, in an F1 cross, you'd usually have F1 parents crossing. But here, we have a parent1 (CC BB) and parent2 (cc bb). That seems like a dihybrid cross between a dominant and recessive individual. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. If you have a heterozygote for one trait and a recessive for another, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are F1 themselves? Or maybe the setup is incorrect. But let's proceed as if these are the two parents for the cross.\n\nSo, the parents are CC BB (dominant for both traits) and cc bb (recessive for both). When they mate, what do their offspring look like?\n\nThe F1 generation would be recombinant, but since there's no crossover happening (assuming independent assortment), the F1 should be Cc Bb.\n\nThen, the F1 individuals (CcBb) self-mate to produce F2. Now, the F2 will have various combinations based on the Punnett square.\n\nBut wait, the initial question says to consider an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (which would mean CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). But adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant a dihybrid cross where one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, leading to F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Then, when they mate, all F1 would be Cc Bb, and then F2 would be the result of that selfing.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nParents:\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n2. cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nMating them produces F1: Cc Bb\n\nSelfing (to get F2):\n\nEach parent (CcBb x CcBb) will produce four types of gametes: CcBb \u2192 CcBb is the genotype, so gametes are C and B (from Cc) and c and b (from BB? Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so in F1, the parents are CcBb. So the F1 gametes would be C and B (from Cc) and c and b (from BB?), which doesn't make sense because the second parent is cc bb, so it can only give c and b. So F1 will be Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb), but wait, no\u2014that's a mistake. Wait, no, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their offspring (F1) are Cc Bb. Because the first parent gives either C or C (since it's homozygous), and the second gives either B or b. So the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) self-pairs:\n\nEach parent can produce gametes: C (from Cc) and c (from cc); B (from Bb) and b (from bb). So the possible gametes are C, c, B, b.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible combinations would be:\n\nCC (from C x C)\nCc (from C x c)\ncC (same as Cc)\ncc (from c x c)\nAnd similarly for B and b.\n\nWait, more systematically, using a Punnett square:\n\nEach parent contributes either C or c and either B or b.\n\nSo the Punnett square would have four quadrants:\n\nTop row: C, c\nLeft column: B, b\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nC (top) x B (left): CB\nC (top) x b (left): Cb\nc (top) x B (left): cB\nc (top) x b (left): cb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the phenotypes based on the given traits:\n\n- Checkered red (C and B)\n- Plain red (C and b)\n- Checkered brown (c and B)\n- Plain brown (c and b)\n\nSo, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CB: Checkered red\n- Cb: Checkered brown\n- cB: Checkered red\n- cb: Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (CB + cB)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (CB)\n- Plain brown: 2 (Cb + cb)\n- Checkered red: 2 (CB + cB)\n\nWait, no\u2014let's count correctly:\n\nFrom the four genotypes:\n\n- CB: Checkered red\n- Cb: Checkered brown\n- cB: Checkered red\n- cb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered red = 2 (two genotypes)\nCheckered brown = 1 (one genotype)\nPlain brown = 2 (two genotypes)\nCheckered red = 2\n\nWait, that sums up to 2+1+2+2=7, which doesn't add up. There must be a miscalculation. Wait, no\u2014if each quadrant represents one bird, then there are four birds total.\n\nSo:\n\n- CB: Checkered red\n- Cb: Checkered brown\n- cB: Checkered red\n- cb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered red: 2 (CB and cB)\nCheckered brown: 1 (Cb)\nPlain brown: 2 (Cb and cb)\nCheckered red: 2\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5? Wait, no\u2014it's four birds. So how does the count go?\n\nActually, each F2 bird has a genotype, so four birds in total. Each with a phenotype:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nCheckered red: 2 (CB and cB)\nCheckered brown: 1 (Cb)\nPlain brown: 2 (cb and something else?) Wait, no\u2014four birds total.\n\nWait, CB, Cb, cB, cb\u2014so:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered red: 2 birds\nCheckered brown: 1 bird\nPlain brown: 2 birds\nCheckered red: 2 birds\n\nWait, that adds up to 5, but there are four birds. There's an inconsistency here. Let me recount:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nThat's four birds. So:\n\nCheckered red: 2 birds\nCheckered brown: 1 bird\nPlain brown: 2 birds\nCheckered red: 2 birds\n\nWait, adding those up: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. But there are only four birds. I must have made a mistake in counting.\n\nAh! Wait, the F2 generation includes all four birds, so:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 2 birds\n- Checkered red: 2 birds\n\nAdding these: 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 birds. That makes sense now.\n\nPhenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 2 birds\n- Checkered red: 2 birds\n\nWait, that's still inconsistent because 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 equals 7, but there are four birds. The correct way is:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (CB and cB)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (Cb)\n- Plain brown: 2 (cb and ?) Wait, no\u2014only one bird with plain brown: cb.\n\nWait, that's three categories. Let me list them clearly:\n\n- CB: Checkered red (1 bird)\n- Cb: Checkered brown (1 bird)\n- cB: Checkered red (1 bird)\n- cb: Plain brown (1 bird)\n\nWait, that totals four birds, each in separate categories. So the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 birds (CB and cB)\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (Cb)\n- Plain brown: 2 birds (cb and ?) Wait, no\u2014only one bird is plain brown.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird in F2 is one of the four genotypes:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red (1 bird)\n2. Cb: Checkered brown (1 bird)\n3. cB: Checkered red (1 bird)\n4. cb: Plain brown (1 bird)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 birds (1 from CB, 1 from cB)\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (1 from Cb)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird (1 from cb)\n\nWait, that sums up to 4 birds, which matches the number of F2 individuals.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nCheckered red: 2\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain brown: 1\n\nWait, but none of the options match this. Let me check the options provided:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB.8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, my calculation gives Checkered red:2, Checkered brown:1, Plain brown:1, Total 4 birds. But the options don't have 2,1,1. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014let's re-examine the F2 generation. The F2 generation consists of all possible genotypes from the dihybrid cross. The correct F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (homog. dominant for both traits)\n- CC bb\n- cc BB\n- cc bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc bb\n\nWait, but in our case, the parents were CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 was Cc Bb, and F2 would be the squares of that.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up earlier steps. Let me start over.\n\nParents: CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nF1 would be Cc Bb (each parent contributes one allele for each gene).\n\nF2 is produced by selfing F1: Cc Bb x Cc Bb.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for this cross:\n\nEach parent can produce four types of gametes: C, c, B, b.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (C from Cc and C from Cc)\n- Cc (C from Cc and c from Cc; also c from Cc and C from Cc)\n- cC (same as Cc)\n- cc (c from Cc and c from Cc)\n- BB (B from Bb and B from Bb)\n- Bb (B from Bb and b from Bb; also b from Bb and B from Bb)\n- bB (same as Bb)\n- bb (b from Bb and b from Bb)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are: CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bB, bb.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive:\n\n- Checkered red (C and B)\n- Plain red (C and b)\n- Checkered brown (c and B)\n- Plain brown (c and b)\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown (if C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b)\nWait, no. Wait, the dominance hierarchy is important. Since C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, any presence of dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: Both dominant, so Checkered red\n- Cc: C dominant, so Checkered brown\n- cC: same as Cc, so Checkered brown\n- cc: Both recessive, so Plain brown\n- BB: B dominant, so Checkered red\n- Bb: B dominant, so Checkered brown\n- bB: same as Bb, so Checkered brown\n- bb: Both recessive, so Plain brown\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC, Cc, cC, BB\n- Checkered brown: Cc, bB, Bb\n- Plain brown: cc, bb\n\nCounting:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (all except Cc and bB/Bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (Cc, Bb, bB)\n- Plain brown: 2 (cc, bb)\nWait, no\u2014Wait, the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bb.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain brown\n- BB: Checkered red\n- Bb: Checkered brown\n- bb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (1) + BB (1) = 2\n- Checkered brown: Cc (1) + Bb (1) + bB (1) = 3\n- Plain brown: cc (1) + bb (1) = 2\n\nWait, that sums up to 2 + 3 + 2 = 7, but there are four types, so perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, no\u2014each F2 bird has a unique genotype, so four birds in total:\n\n1. CC: Checkered red\n2. Cc: Checkered brown\n3. cC: Checkered brown\n4. cc: Plain brown\n\nSimilarly,\n\n5. BB: Checkered red\n6. Bb: Checkered brown\n7. bB: Checkered brown\n8. bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014there are eight F2 birds, each with a unique combination. Wait, no, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross typically results in 9 possible genotypes, but some may be homozygous. However, in this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F1 is a dihybrid, and the F2 would include all possible combinations, including homozygotes.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n1. CC\n2. Cc\n3. cC\n4. cc\n5. BB\n6. Bb\n7. bB\n8. bb\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Checkered red\n2. Cc: Checkered brown\n3. cC: Checkered brown\n4. cc: Plain brown\n5. BB: Checkered red\n6. Bb: Checkered brown\n7. bB: Checkered brown\n8. bb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: CC, BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: Cc, Bb, bB \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain brown: cc, bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nBut wait, that sums up to 2 + 3 + 2 = 7 birds, but there are 8 F2 birds.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have two birds being crossed: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to determine the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio based on their genetic makeup. The options are given from A to J, each with different ratios.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the parents' genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\n- Homozygous dominant for both genes.\n- So, they're definitely going to produce only one type of gamete: C and B.\n- Therefore, all F1 will be CB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb\n- Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n- They can only produce gametes that are cc and bb.\n- So, all F1 will be cb.\n\nWait, but the F1s would be a cross between a purebred CB and another CB? No, wait, the parents themselves are F1 because they're not yet crossed. Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, in an F1 cross, you'd usually have F1 parents crossing. But here, we have a parent1 (CC BB) and parent2 (cc bb). That seems like a dihybrid cross between a dominant and recessive individual. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. If you have a heterozygote for one trait and a recessive for another, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are F1 themselves? Or maybe the setup is incorrect. But let's proceed as if these are the two parents for the cross.\n\nSo, the parents are CC BB (dominant for both traits) and cc bb (recessive for both). When they mate, what do their offspring look like?\n\nThe F1 generation would be recombinant, but since there's no crossover happening (assuming independent assortment), the F1 should be Cc Bb.\n\nThen, the F1 individuals (CcBb) self-mate to produce F2. Now, the F2 will have various combinations based on the Punnett square.\n\nBut wait, the initial question says to consider an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (which would mean CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). But adihybrid crosses usually involve two different traits. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant a dihybrid cross where one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, leading to F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Then, when they mate, all F1 would be Cc Bb, and then F2 would be the result of that selfing.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nParents:\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n2. cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nMating them produces F1: Cc Bb\n\nSelfing (to get F2):\n\nEach parent (CcBb x CcBb) will produce four types of gametes: CcBb \u2192 CcBb is the genotype, so gametes are C and B (from Cc) and c and b (from BB? Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so in F1, the parents are CcBb. So the F1 gametes would be C and B (from Cc) and c and b (from BB?), which doesn't make sense because the second parent is cc bb, so it can only give c and b. So F1 will be Cc (from Cc) and Bb (from Bb), but wait, no\u2014that's a mistake. Wait, no, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So their offspring (F1) are Cc Bb. Because the first parent gives either C or C (since it's homozygous), and the second gives either B or b. So the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) self-pairs:\n\nEach parent can produce gametes: C (from Cc) and c (from cc); B (from Bb) and b (from bb). So the possible gametes are C, c, B, b.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible combinations would be:\n\nCC (from C x C)\nCc (from C x c)\ncC (same as Cc)\ncc (from c x c)\nAnd similarly for B and b.\n\nWait, more systematically, using a Punnett square:\n\nEach parent contributes either C or c and either B or b.\n\nSo the Punnett square would have four quadrants:\n\nTop row: C, c\nLeft column: B, b\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nC (top) x B (left): CB\nC (top) x b (left): Cb\nc (top) x B (left): cB\nc (top) x b (left): cb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the phenotypes based on the given traits:\n\n- Checkered red (C and B)\n- Plain red (C and b)\n- Checkered brown (c and B)\n- Plain brown (c and b)\n\nSo, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CB: Checkered red\n- Cb: Checkered brown\n- cB: Checkered red\n- cb: Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (CB + cB)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (CB)\n- Plain brown: 2 (Cb + cb)\n- Checkered red: 2 (CB + cB)\n\nWait, no\u2014let's count correctly:\n\nFrom the four genotypes:\n\n- CB: Checkered red\n- Cb: Checkered brown\n- cB: Checkered red\n- cb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered red = 2 (two genotypes)\nCheckered brown = 1 (one genotype)\nPlain brown = 2 (two genotypes)\nCheckered red = 2\n\nWait, that sums up to 2+1+2+2=7, which doesn't add up. There must be a miscalculation. Wait, no\u2014if each quadrant represents one bird, then there are four birds total.\n\nSo:\n\n- CB: Checkered red\n- Cb: Checkered brown\n- cB: Checkered red\n- cb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered red: 2 (CB and cB)\nCheckered brown: 1 (Cb)\nPlain brown: 2 (Cb and cb)\nCheckered red: 2\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5? Wait, no\u2014it's four birds. So how does the count go?\n\nActually, each F2 bird has a genotype, so four birds in total. Each with a phenotype:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nCheckered red: 2 (CB and cB)\nCheckered brown: 1 (Cb)\nPlain brown: 2 (cb and something else?) Wait, no\u2014four birds total.\n\nWait, CB, Cb, cB, cb\u2014so:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered red: 2 birds\nCheckered brown: 1 bird\nPlain brown: 2 birds\nCheckered red: 2 birds\n\nWait, that adds up to 5, but there are four birds. There's an inconsistency here. Let me recount:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nThat's four birds. So:\n\nCheckered red: 2 birds\nCheckered brown: 1 bird\nPlain brown: 2 birds\nCheckered red: 2 birds\n\nWait, adding those up: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. But there are only four birds. I must have made a mistake in counting.\n\nAh! Wait, the F2 generation includes all four birds, so:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 2 birds\n- Checkered red: 2 birds\n\nAdding these: 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 birds. That makes sense now.\n\nPhenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 2 birds\n- Checkered red: 2 birds\n\nWait, that's still inconsistent because 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 equals 7, but there are four birds. The correct way is:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red\n2. Cb: Checkered brown\n3. cB: Checkered red\n4. cb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (CB and cB)\n- Checkered brown: 1 (Cb)\n- Plain brown: 2 (cb and ?) Wait, no\u2014only one bird with plain brown: cb.\n\nWait, that's three categories. Let me list them clearly:\n\n- CB: Checkered red (1 bird)\n- Cb: Checkered brown (1 bird)\n- cB: Checkered red (1 bird)\n- cb: Plain brown (1 bird)\n\nWait, that totals four birds, each in separate categories. So the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 birds (CB and cB)\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (Cb)\n- Plain brown: 2 birds (cb and ?) Wait, no\u2014only one bird is plain brown.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird in F2 is one of the four genotypes:\n\n1. CB: Checkered red (1 bird)\n2. Cb: Checkered brown (1 bird)\n3. cB: Checkered red (1 bird)\n4. cb: Plain brown (1 bird)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 birds (1 from CB, 1 from cB)\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (1 from Cb)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird (1 from cb)\n\nWait, that sums up to 4 birds, which matches the number of F2 individuals.\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nCheckered red: 2\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain brown: 1\n\nWait, but none of the options match this. Let me check the options provided:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB.8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, my calculation gives Checkered red:2, Checkered brown:1, Plain brown:1, Total 4 birds. But the options don't have 2,1,1. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014let's re-examine the F2 generation. The F2 generation consists of all possible genotypes from the dihybrid cross. The correct F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (homog. dominant for both traits)\n- CC bb\n- cc BB\n- cc bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc bb\n\nWait, but in our case, the parents were CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 was Cc Bb, and F2 would be the squares of that.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I messed up earlier steps. Let me start over.\n\nParents: CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nF1 would be Cc Bb (each parent contributes one allele for each gene).\n\nF2 is produced by selfing F1: Cc Bb x Cc Bb.\n\nUsing a Punnett square for this cross:\n\nEach parent can produce four types of gametes: C, c, B, b.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (C from Cc and C from Cc)\n- Cc (C from Cc and c from Cc; also c from Cc and C from Cc)\n- cC (same as Cc)\n- cc (c from Cc and c from Cc)\n- BB (B from Bb and B from Bb)\n- Bb (B from Bb and b from Bb; also b from Bb and B from Bb)\n- bB (same as Bb)\n- bb (b from Bb and b from Bb)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are: CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bB, bb.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive:\n\n- Checkered red (C and B)\n- Plain red (C and b)\n- Checkered brown (c and B)\n- Plain brown (c and b)\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown (if C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b)\nWait, no. Wait, the dominance hierarchy is important. Since C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, any presence of dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: Both dominant, so Checkered red\n- Cc: C dominant, so Checkered brown\n- cC: same as Cc, so Checkered brown\n- cc: Both recessive, so Plain brown\n- BB: B dominant, so Checkered red\n- Bb: B dominant, so Checkered brown\n- bB: same as Bb, so Checkered brown\n- bb: Both recessive, so Plain brown\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC, Cc, cC, BB\n- Checkered brown: Cc, bB, Bb\n- Plain brown: cc, bb\n\nCounting:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (all except Cc and bB/Bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (Cc, Bb, bB)\n- Plain brown: 2 (cc, bb)\nWait, no\u2014Wait, the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bb.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain brown\n- BB: Checkered red\n- Bb: Checkered brown\n- bb: Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (1) + BB (1) = 2\n- Checkered brown: Cc (1) + Bb (1) + bB (1) = 3\n- Plain brown: cc (1) + bb (1) = 2\n\nWait, that sums up to 2 + 3 + 2 = 7, but there are four types, so perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, no\u2014each F2 bird has a unique genotype, so four birds in total:\n\n1. CC: Checkered red\n2. Cc: Checkered brown\n3. cC: Checkered brown\n4. cc: Plain brown\n\nSimilarly,\n\n5. BB: Checkered red\n6. Bb: Checkered brown\n7. bB: Checkered brown\n8. bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014there are eight F2 birds, each with a unique combination. Wait, no, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross typically results in 9 possible genotypes, but some may be homozygous. However, in this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F1 is a dihybrid, and the F2 would include all possible combinations, including homozygotes.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n1. CC\n2. Cc\n3. cC\n4. cc\n5. BB\n6. Bb\n7. bB\n8. bb\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes:\n\n1. CC: Checkered red\n2. Cc: Checkered brown\n3. cC: Checkered brown\n4. cc: Plain brown\n5. BB: Checkered red\n6.

    "chunk_resampled": "Let me start by breaking it down.",
    "rollout": " Let me start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, there are two birds involved in an adihybridcross. One is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are dominant for the red color. So that bird's genotype must be CC and BB because red is dominant over brown (B is dominant, b is recessive). The other bird is a plain brown one, so their genotype is cc and bb since brown is recessive.\n\nNow, we're looking at a Punnett square between these two birds. Since they're both heterozygous (they have one dominant and one recessive allele), each bird will produce gametes with either the dominant or recessive allele. \n\nSo the first bird (CCBB) can produce CB and cb gametes. Similarly, the second bird (ccbb) can produce cb and cc gametes. When we combine these, the possible offspring genotypes would be:\n\n- CB x cb = CcBb\n- CB x cc = Ccbb\n- cb x cb = ccbb\n\nWait, no, actually, each bird contributes one gamete. So let me correct that. Each bird has four possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, cc? Wait, no. A bird like CCBB can produce four types of gametes based on its alleles. Since it's CCBB, all gametes should be CB, right? Because both parents contribute one allele each from each pair. Wait, no, perhaps not. Maybe I need to think differently. \n\nAlternatively, since both parents are heterozygous, their gametes would be 50% CB and 50% cb. So when you cross them, you get four combinations: CB x CB, CB x cb, cb x CB, cb x cb. But wait, each parent produces two gametes, so total combinations are 4 x 4 = 16 possible offspring, but considering dominance, some phenotypes might be the same.\n\nBut maybe I'm complicating it. Let's go back. The actual question mentions creating a Punnett square for an adihybridcross, which typically involves two genes. Here, the two birds are both dihybrids, so each gene is being considered separately.\n\nThe first bird is CCBB, so for the first gene (red/brown), it's CC (dominant) and BB (dominant). For the second gene (color/purple/gray?), it's Cc (since C is dominant and c is recessive). Wait, no, the problem says red is C, brown is c, and color is B, brown is b. Oh, okay, so it's two genes here: one determining color (B for red, b for brown) and another determining shape (B for checkered, b for plain).\n\nSo the bird is CCBB, meaning for the first gene (color), both alleles are dominant (B), so it's red. For the second gene (shape), both alleles are dominant (B), so it's checkered. The other bird is ccbb, which is plain brown, as both alleles are recessive.\n\nWe're crossing CCBB (homozygous) with ccbb (homozygous). So the offspring will be CcBb. Wait, but the question asks about a dihybrid cross where each parent is dihybrid. So maybe the parents are each dihybrid, but in this case, one is homozygous and the other is homozygous. That might complicate things, but perhaps it's still manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the parent is CC BB, so for the color gene, both are dominant (B), and for shape, both are dominant (B). The other bird is cc bb, so for color, both are recessive (b), and for shape, both are recessive (b). So the F1 generation after selfing would be CcBb.\n\nThen, the F1 flies are crossed to each other. The next generation (F2) would involve the F1 parents producing gametes. Each parent is CcBb, so for each gene, they'll produce a combination of CB, cb, cB, and cb gametes, each at 25%.\n\nWhen you cross two CcBb individuals, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 CcBb CcBb \u00d7 CcBb CcBb. The gametes are all possible combinations, leading to 16 possible combinations. However, due to dominance, some phenotypes will overlap. For example, if both alleles are B, the phenotype is red. If any allele is b, regardless of the other, the phenotype becomes brown. Similarly, for shape, if both alleles are B, the phenotype is checkered; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSo the F2 will have different combinations depending on the alleles each parent contributes. Then, the phenotypes can be categorized based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the user wants to know the phenotypic ratio. The options are A through H, each suggesting different ratios.\n\nLet me calculate the expected phenotypes. Each gene independently assorts, so the number of phenotypes depends on the combinations of the two genes.\n\nFor the color gene (B for red, b for brown):\n\n- Both alleles B \u2192 red\n- At least one b \u2192 brown\n\nFor the shape gene (B for checkered, b for plain):\n\n- Both alleles B \u2192 checkered\n- At least one b \u2192 plain\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypes can be determined by combining these possibilities.\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (both genes have dominant alleles)\n2. Checkered brown (shape is brown, color is checkered)\n3. Plain red (color is red, shape is plain)\n4. Plain brown (color is brown, shape is plain)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n1. Both color alleles B and shape alleles B.\n2. Color allele b, shape allele B.\n3. Color allele B, shape allele b.\n4. Both color and shape alleles b.\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor the color gene (B): probability of B is 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of bb).\nFor the shape gene (B): probability of B is 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is (probability for color) * (probability for shape).\n\n1. Checkered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Checkered brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain red: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2013 No, doesn't match.\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2013 No.\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2013 Yes! It matches exactly with what I calculated.\n\nWait, option D says Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. No, my calculation shows Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1. So none of the options directly match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me double-check the probabilities. For the color gene, probability of B is 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of bb), and for the shape gene, also 3/4.\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nCheckered brown: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nPlain red: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nPlain brown: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6\u2192No.\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192Yes, but order is wrong.\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192Nope.\nOption J:2,6,3,1\u2192No.\nOption A:6,2,2,6\u2192No.\nOption B:8,4,4,0\u2192No.\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192Yes!\nWait, option C says Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, there are two birds involved in an adihybridcross. One is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are dominant for the red color. So that bird's genotype must be CC and BB because red is dominant over brown (B is dominant, b is recessive). The other bird is a plain brown one, so their genotype is cc and bb since brown is recessive.\n\nNow, we're looking at a Punnett square between these two birds. Since they're both heterozygous (they have one dominant and one recessive allele), each bird will produce gametes with either the dominant or recessive allele. \n\nSo the first bird (CCBB) can produce CB and cb gametes. Similarly, the second bird (ccbb) can produce cb and cc gametes. When we combine these, the possible offspring genotypes would be:\n\n- CB x cb = CcBb\n- CB x cc = Ccbb\n- cb x cb = ccbb\n\nWait, no, actually, each bird contributes one gamete. So let me correct that. Each bird has four possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, cc? Wait, no. A bird like CCBB can produce four types of gametes based on its alleles. Since it's CCBB, all gametes should be CB, right? Because both parents contribute one allele each from each pair. Wait, no, perhaps not. Maybe I need to think differently. \n\nAlternatively, since both parents are heterozygous, their gametes would be 50% CB and 50% cb. So when you cross them, you get four combinations: CB x CB, CB x cb, cb x CB, cb x cb. But wait, each parent produces two gametes, so total combinations are 4 x 4 = 16 possible offspring, but considering dominance, some phenotypes might be the same.\n\nBut maybe I'm complicating it. Let's go back. The actual question mentions creating a Punnett square for an adihybridcross, which typically involves two genes. Here, the two birds are both dihybrids, so each gene is being considered separately.\n\nThe first bird is CCBB, so for the first gene (red/brown), it's CC (dominant) and BB (dominant). For the second gene (color/purple/gray?), it's Cc (since C is dominant and c is recessive). Wait, no, the problem says red is C, brown is c, and color is B, brown is b. Oh, okay, so it's two genes here: one determining color (B for red, b for brown) and another determining shape (B for checkered, b for plain).\n\nSo the bird is CCBB, meaning for the first gene (color), both alleles are dominant (B), so it's red. For the second gene (shape), both alleles are dominant (B), so it's checkered. The other bird is ccbb, which is plain brown, as both alleles are recessive.\n\nWe're crossing CCBB (homozygous) with ccbb (homozygous). So the offspring will be CcBb. Wait, but the question asks about a dihybrid cross where each parent is dihybrid. So maybe the parents are each dihybrid, but in this case, one is homozygous and the other is homozygous. That might complicate things, but perhaps it's still manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps the parent is CC BB, so for the color gene, both are dominant (B), and for shape, both are dominant (B). The other bird is cc bb, so for color, both are recessive (b), and for shape, both are recessive (b). So the F1 generation after selfing would be CcBb.\n\nThen, the F1 flies are crossed to each other. The next generation (F2) would involve the F1 parents producing gametes. Each parent is CcBb, so for each gene, they'll produce a combination of CB, cb, cB, and cb gametes, each at 25%.\n\nWhen you cross two CcBb individuals, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 CcBb CcBb \u00d7 CcBb CcBb. The gametes are all possible combinations, leading to 16 possible combinations. However, due to dominance, some phenotypes will overlap. For example, if both alleles are B, the phenotype is red. If any allele is b, regardless of the other, the phenotype becomes brown. Similarly, for shape, if both alleles are B, the phenotype is checkered; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSo the F2 will have different combinations depending on the alleles each parent contributes. Then, the phenotypes can be categorized based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nLooking at the options provided, the user wants to know the phenotypic ratio. The options are A through H, each suggesting different ratios.\n\nLet me calculate the expected phenotypes. Each gene independently assorts, so the number of phenotypes depends on the combinations of the two genes.\n\nFor the color gene (B for red, b for brown):\n\n- Both alleles B \u2192 red\n- At least one b \u2192 brown\n\nFor the shape gene (B for checkered, b for plain):\n\n- Both alleles B \u2192 checkered\n- At least one b \u2192 plain\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypes can be determined by combining these possibilities.\n\nPossible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (both genes have dominant alleles)\n2. Checkered brown (shape is brown, color is checkered)\n3. Plain red (color is red, shape is plain)\n4. Plain brown (color is brown, shape is plain)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n1. Both color alleles B and shape alleles B.\n2. Color allele b, shape allele B.\n3. Color allele B, shape allele b.\n4. Both color and shape alleles b.\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor the color gene (B): probability of B is 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of bb).\nFor the shape gene (B): probability of B is 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is (probability for color) * (probability for shape).\n\n1. Checkered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Checkered brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain red: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2013 No, doesn't match.\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2013 No.\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2013 Yes! It matches exactly with what I calculated.\n\nWait, option D says Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. No, my calculation shows Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1. So none of the options directly match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me double-check the probabilities. For the color gene, probability of B is 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of bb), and for the shape gene, also 3/4.\n\nSo:\n\nCheckered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nCheckered brown: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nPlain red: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nPlain brown: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 3 Plain red, 1 Plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6\u2192No.\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192Yes, but order is wrong.\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192Nope.\nOption J:2,6,3,1\u2192No.\nOption A:6,2,2,6\u2192No.\nOption B:8,4,4,0\u2192No.\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192Yes!\nWait, option C says Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1.

    "rollout": " It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's a checkered red and another that's plain brown. The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation after they have mated together.\n\nFirst, let me break down what each trait means. There are two genes involved here: one controlling color (B and b) and another controlling dominance (C and c). \n\nThe checkered pattern is dominant, so it's controlled by gene C. The presence of 'C' on the genotype would mean the bird has the dominant color gene. Plain color must be from the recessive allele 'c', so any bird without a 'c' will look plain.\n\nRed color is determined by the dominant gene B, which I assume means if there's at least one 'B' allele, the bird will be red. Brown is the recessive 'b' trait, so only when both alleles are 'b' will the bird be brown.\n\nNow, the parent birds are:\n\n1. CCBB: This bird is checkered red because the first gene is C (dominant), and the second gene is B (dominant since B is the dominant allele for red).\n\n2. ccbb: This bird is plain brown because the first gene is c (recessive, so plain) and the second gene is b (recessive, so brown).\n\nSo, we're crossing these two birds. Let's start by figuring out their offspring.\n\nSince CCBB is a dominant bird, all its gametes should carry the dominant alleles for both genes. Similarly, ccbb is a recessive bird, so all its gametes will carry the recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nTherefore, all F1 offspring from this cross will be CcBb. Because when you combine CC (from CCBB) with cc (from ccbb), you get Cc for the first gene, and BB (from CCBB) with bb gives Bb for the second gene? Wait, no\u2014let me think again. Actually, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, the first gene: CC (from CCBB) can produce C or C gametes, and cc (from ccbb) produces c gametes. So for the first gene, possible gametes are Cc (since both parents contribute C and c respectively). \n\nFor the second gene, BB (from CCBB) can produce B or B gametes, and bb (from ccbb) produces b gametes. So possible gametes are Bb.\n\nThus, the F1 individuals will be CcBb. Now, each gene is independently assorting, so for the first gene, Cc will produce either C or c, and Bb will produce either B or b. So the F1 will have four combinations: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nNow, considering a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits, the F1 generation will have a certain distribution. But wait, actually, both parents are homozygous for both traits. That changes things. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). Each bird is homozygous for both genes but different phenotypes based on their combination of alleles. So their F1 offspring will be CcBb, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut now, we need to consider the F2 generation, which comes from the F1 parents. Since the F1 are CcBb, they can self-pollinate or interbreed among themselves. In this case, it's F1 \u00d7 F1, so the F2 will come from the F1 crossed with each other.\n\nHowever, the question says \"adihybridcross,\" which might imply a dihybrid cross, meaning combining two different parents, perhaps. But looking back, the user mentioned a dihybrid cross between a checkered red and a plain brown bird. Then, the next part talks about an F1 cross, which seems off because a dihybrid cross should involve two different parents. Maybe a typo, and the intended parents were a dihybrid cross itself.\n\nAnyway, moving forward. We need to calculate the F2 phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let's outline the parents for the F2 cross. If we're doing a standard dihybrid cross, the parents would typically be AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, but in this case, the parents are already known as CCBB and ccbb. However, since we're dealing with a dihybrid cross, maybe the parents are AaBb and AaBb, but in our case, the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which simplifies things.\n\nWait, no, the initial cross was between CCBB and ccbb, resulting in F1 of CcBb. Then, the F1 cross is F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to F2. So the F2 will be from the F1 parents crossed with each other.\n\nLet me list the possible gametes from F1 CcBb:\n\n- First gene: Cc \u2192 C or c\n- Second gene: Bb \u2192 B or b\n\nSo the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nEach gamete has a 25% chance of being each type.\n\nWhen F1 CcBb mates with another F1 CcBb, each gamete from the first F1 combines with each gamete from the second F1, resulting in a Punnett square.\n\nLet me construct that:\n\nGametes:\nFrom Parent 1: CB, Cb, cB, cb\nFrom Parent 2: CB, Cb, cB, cb\n\nSo the Punnett square will have 16 possible combinations. Let's map them:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n2. CB \u00d7 Cb = CcBb + CcBb\n3. CB \u00d7 cB = CcBb + CcBb\n4. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb + CcBb\n5. Cb \u00d7 CB = same as above\n6. Cb \u00d7 Cb = CcBb\n7. Cb \u00d7 cB = same as above\n8. Cb \u00d7 cb = same as above\n9. cB \u00d7 CB = same\n10. cB \u00d7 Cb = same\n11. cB \u00d7 cB = c c Bb\n12. cB \u00d7 cb = same\n13. cb \u00d7 CB = same\n14. cb \u00d7 Cb = same\n15. cb \u00d7 cB = same\n16. cb \u00d7 cb = ccBB\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of each genotype:\n\nLooking for each possible genotype:\n\n- CcBb: How many?\nLooking at the combinations where each gene is not recessive (i.e., not c and b):\n\nTotal possibilities where neither gene is recessive: for each gene, there are three possibilities (C, c, B, b). Wait, no\u2014for each gene, the presence of dominant allele allows the phenotype. So for the F2 generation, each gene is independent.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each gene follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation. So for two genes, the total phenotypic ratios would be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square approach, let's compute the frequency of each genotype.\n\nThe possible genotypes are:\n\nCCBB, CcBb, CcBB, ccBB,\n\nSimilarly for the other gene:\n\nBBBb, CBBb, cBBb, ccBB.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for dihybrid crosses.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\nFor two genes:\n\n(9/16) for the first gene (non-recessive)\n(9/16) for the second gene,\nand then combined for both.\n\nActually, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each gene, but since both are present, it's more like 9:3:3:1 for each gene, but combined as 9:3:3:1 for each individual phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for monohybrid crosses. For dihybrid crosses, each gene segregates independently, so the overall phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each phenotype combination.\n\nWait, actually, each of the four phenotypes (red-brown, checkered-red, checkered-brown, plain-checkered) occurs in specific ratios.\n\nBut given that the parents are both homozygous for both traits, the F1 will all be CcBb, and the F2 will result from their own dihybrid cross.\n\nSo for the F2:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when both genes are dominant (C and B). Since the bird is checkered, it's because C is dominant, making it red, and also because it's checkered due to both alleles being dominant. Wait, no\u2014the presence of 'C' makes it red, but 'B' determines whether it's brown or red. So checkered red would be when C is dominant and B is dominant, i.e., C B. Checkered brown would be C B with bb. Plain red would be cc and BB. Plain brown would be cc and Bb.\n\nSo, checking the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CCBB: Checkered red.\n2. CCBb: Checkered brown.\n3. CcBB: Checkered brown.\n4. CcBb: Checkered red.\n5. ccBB: Plain red.\n6. ccBb: Plain brown.\n7. CcBB: Checkered brown.\n8. CcBb: Checkered red.\n9. ccBB: Plain red.\n10. ccBb: Plain brown.\n11. CcBB: Checkered brown.\n12. CcBb: Checkered red.\n13. ccBB: Plain red.\n14. ccBb: Plain brown.\n15. CcBB: Checkered brown.\n16. CcBb: Checkered red.\n\nNow, counting:\n\nCheckered red (1): positions 1,4,7,12 \u2013 total 4.\nCheckered brown (2,3,5,9,11,15): 6.\nPlain red (5,9,13,17): 4.\nPlain brown (6,8,14,16): 4.\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+6+4+4=18, which isn't right because there are 16 possible outcomes. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. CCBB\n4. CcBb\n7. CcBB\n12. CcBb\n15. CcBB\n\nThat's 5 instances of Checkered red.\n\nCheckered brown:\n\n2. CcBb\n3. CcBB\n5. ccBB\n9. CcBb\n11. ccBB\n15. ccBB?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I miscounted. Let me list them:\n\n1. CCBB - Checkered red\n2. CcBb - Checkered brown\n3. CcBB - Checkered brown\n4. ccBB - Plain red\n5. CcBb - Checkered brown\n6. CcBB - Checkered brown\n7. ccBB - Plain red\n8. CcBb - Checkered brown\n9. ccBb - Plain brown\n10. CcBB - Checkered brown\n11. ccBB - Plain red\n12. CcBb - Checkered brown\n13. ccBB - Plain red\n14. CcBb - Checkered brown\n15. ccBB - Plain red\n16. CcBb - Checkered brown\n\nWait, now I see. Let's categorize correctly:\n\n- Checkered red (only when C is dominant and B is dominant):\n   Positions 1,4,7,12,15: 5 instances.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, position 1: CCBB (both dominant), position 4: CcBb (C dominant, B dominant), position 7: CcBB (C dominant, B dominant), position 12: CcBb (same), and position 15: CcBB (same). That's five instances. But according to some sources, checkered red should only occur when both genes are dominant, so that's 4 instances.\n\nHmm, maybe my confusion arises from how the genes interact. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each phenotype combination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to refer to the standard dihybrid cross. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation will have 9:3:3:1 ratio for each phenotype.\n\nBut in this case, since the parents are both homozygous for both traits, the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, F2 will be based on this.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: When both genes are dominant (C and B are dominant). Since the bird is CcBb, both alleles are dominant for both traits. So this phenotype is 9/16.\n\n2. Checkered brown: When C is dominant, but B is recessive (so Bb). So CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive. This is 3/16.\n\n3. Plain red: When c is dominant for the first gene, and B is recessive (so Bb). So ccBb \u2192 3/16.\n\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's a checkered red and another that's plain brown. The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratios in the F2 generation after they have mated together.\n\nFirst, let me break down what each trait means. There are two genes involved here: one controlling color (B and b) and another controlling dominance (C and c). \n\nThe checkered pattern is dominant, so it's controlled by gene C. The presence of 'C' on the genotype would mean the bird has the dominant color gene. Plain color must be from the recessive allele 'c', so any bird without a 'c' will look plain.\n\nRed color is determined by the dominant gene B, which I assume means if there's at least one 'B' allele, the bird will be red. Brown is the recessive 'b' trait, so only when both alleles are 'b' will the bird be brown.\n\nNow, the parent birds are:\n\n1. CCBB: This bird is checkered red because the first gene is C (dominant), and the second gene is B (dominant since B is the dominant allele for red).\n\n2. ccbb: This bird is plain brown because the first gene is c (recessive, so plain) and the second gene is b (recessive, so brown).\n\nSo, we're crossing these two birds. Let's start by figuring out their offspring.\n\nSince CCBB is a dominant bird, all its gametes should carry the dominant alleles for both genes. Similarly, ccbb is a recessive bird, so all its gametes will carry the recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nTherefore, all F1 offspring from this cross will be CcBb. Because when you combine CC (from CCBB) with cc (from ccbb), you get Cc for the first gene, and BB (from CCBB) with bb gives Bb for the second gene? Wait, no\u2014let me think again. Actually, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, the first gene: CC (from CCBB) can produce C or C gametes, and cc (from ccbb) produces c gametes. So for the first gene, possible gametes are Cc (since both parents contribute C and c respectively). \n\nFor the second gene, BB (from CCBB) can produce B or B gametes, and bb (from ccbb) produces b gametes. So possible gametes are Bb.\n\nThus, the F1 individuals will be CcBb. Now, each gene is independently assorting, so for the first gene, Cc will produce either C or c, and Bb will produce either B or b. So the F1 will have four combinations: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nNow, considering a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits, the F1 generation will have a certain distribution. But wait, actually, both parents are homozygous for both traits. That changes things. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). Each bird is homozygous for both genes but different phenotypes based on their combination of alleles. So their F1 offspring will be CcBb, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut now, we need to consider the F2 generation, which comes from the F1 parents. Since the F1 are CcBb, they can self-pollinate or interbreed among themselves. In this case, it's F1 \u00d7 F1, so the F2 will come from the F1 crossed with each other.\n\nHowever, the question says \"adihybridcross,\" which might imply a dihybrid cross, meaning combining two different parents, perhaps. But looking back, the user mentioned a dihybrid cross between a checkered red and a plain brown bird. Then, the next part talks about an F1 cross, which seems off because a dihybrid cross should involve two different parents. Maybe a typo, and the intended parents were a dihybrid cross itself.\n\nAnyway, moving forward. We need to calculate the F2 phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let's outline the parents for the F2 cross. If we're doing a standard dihybrid cross, the parents would typically be AaBb \u00d7 AaBb, but in this case, the parents are already known as CCBB and ccbb. However, since we're dealing with a dihybrid cross, maybe the parents are AaBb and AaBb, but in our case, the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which simplifies things.\n\nWait, no, the initial cross was between CCBB and ccbb, resulting in F1 of CcBb. Then, the F1 cross is F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to F2. So the F2 will be from the F1 parents crossed with each other.\n\nLet me list the possible gametes from F1 CcBb:\n\n- First gene: Cc \u2192 C or c\n- Second gene: Bb \u2192 B or b\n\nSo the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nEach gamete has a 25% chance of being each type.\n\nWhen F1 CcBb mates with another F1 CcBb, each gamete from the first F1 combines with each gamete from the second F1, resulting in a Punnett square.\n\nLet me construct that:\n\nGametes:\nFrom Parent 1: CB, Cb, cB, cb\nFrom Parent 2: CB, Cb, cB, cb\n\nSo the Punnett square will have 16 possible combinations. Let's map them:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n2. CB \u00d7 Cb = CcBb + CcBb\n3. CB \u00d7 cB = CcBb + CcBb\n4. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb + CcBb\n5. Cb \u00d7 CB = same as above\n6. Cb \u00d7 Cb = CcBb\n7. Cb \u00d7 cB = same as above\n8. Cb \u00d7 cb = same as above\n9. cB \u00d7 CB = same\n10. cB \u00d7 Cb = same\n11. cB \u00d7 cB = c c Bb\n12. cB \u00d7 cb = same\n13. cb \u00d7 CB = same\n14. cb \u00d7 Cb = same\n15. cb \u00d7 cB = same\n16. cb \u00d7 cb = ccBB\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of each genotype:\n\nLooking for each possible genotype:\n\n- CcBb: How many?\nLooking at the combinations where each gene is not recessive (i.e., not c and b):\n\nTotal possibilities where neither gene is recessive: for each gene, there are three possibilities (C, c, B, b). Wait, no\u2014for each gene, the presence of dominant allele allows the phenotype. So for the F2 generation, each gene is independent.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each gene follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation. So for two genes, the total phenotypic ratios would be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square approach, let's compute the frequency of each genotype.\n\nThe possible genotypes are:\n\nCCBB, CcBb, CcBB, ccBB,\n\nSimilarly for the other gene:\n\nBBBb, CBBb, cBBb, ccBB.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for dihybrid crosses.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\nFor two genes:\n\n(9/16) for the first gene (non-recessive)\n(9/16) for the second gene,\nand then combined for both.\n\nActually, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each gene, but since both are present, it's more like 9:3:3:1 for each gene, but combined as 9:3:3:1 for each individual phenotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for monohybrid crosses. For dihybrid crosses, each gene segregates independently, so the overall phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each phenotype combination.\n\nWait, actually, each of the four phenotypes (red-brown, checkered-red, checkered-brown, plain-checkered) occurs in specific ratios.\n\nBut given that the parents are both homozygous for both traits, the F1 will all be CcBb, and the F2 will result from their own dihybrid cross.\n\nSo for the F2:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when both genes are dominant (C and B). Since the bird is checkered, it's because C is dominant, making it red, and also because it's checkered due to both alleles being dominant. Wait, no\u2014the presence of 'C' makes it red, but 'B' determines whether it's brown or red. So checkered red would be when C is dominant and B is dominant, i.e., C B. Checkered brown would be C B with bb. Plain red would be cc and BB. Plain brown would be cc and Bb.\n\nSo, checking the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CCBB: Checkered red.\n2. CCBb: Checkered brown.\n3. CcBB: Checkered brown.\n4. CcBb: Checkered red.\n5. ccBB: Plain red.\n6. ccBb: Plain brown.\n7. CcBB: Checkered brown.\n8. CcBb: Checkered red.\n9. ccBB: Plain red.\n10. ccBb: Plain brown.\n11. CcBB: Checkered brown.\n12. CcBb: Checkered red.\n13. ccBB: Plain red.\n14. ccBb: Plain brown.\n15. CcBB: Checkered brown.\n16. CcBb: Checkered red.\n\nNow, counting:\n\nCheckered red (1): positions 1,4,7,12 \u2013 total 4.\nCheckered brown (2,3,5,9,11,15): 6.\nPlain red (5,9,13,17): 4.\nPlain brown (6,8,14,16): 4.\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+6+4+4=18, which isn't right because there are 16 possible outcomes. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. CCBB\n4. CcBb\n7. CcBB\n12. CcBb\n15. CcBB\n\nThat's 5 instances of Checkered red.\n\nCheckered brown:\n\n2. CcBb\n3. CcBB\n5. ccBB\n9. CcBb\n11. ccBB\n15. ccBB?\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I miscounted. Let me list them:\n\n1. CCBB - Checkered red\n2. CcBb - Checkered brown\n3. CcBB - Checkered brown\n4. ccBB - Plain red\n5. CcBb - Checkered brown\n6. CcBB - Checkered brown\n7. ccBB - Plain red\n8. CcBb - Checkered brown\n9. ccBb - Plain brown\n10. CcBB - Checkered brown\n11. ccBB - Plain red\n12. CcBb - Checkered brown\n13. ccBB - Plain red\n14. CcBb - Checkered brown\n15. ccBB - Plain red\n16. CcBb - Checkered brown\n\nWait, now I see. Let's categorize correctly:\n\n- Checkered red (only when C is dominant and B is dominant):\n   Positions 1,4,7,12,15: 5 instances.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, position 1: CCBB (both dominant), position 4: CcBb (C dominant, B dominant), position 7: CcBB (C dominant, B dominant), position 12: CcBb (same), and position 15: CcBB (same). That's five instances. But according to some sources, checkered red should only occur when both genes are dominant, so that's 4 instances.\n\nHmm, maybe my confusion arises from how the genes interact. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for each phenotype combination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to refer to the standard dihybrid cross. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation will have 9:3:3:1 ratio for each phenotype.\n\nBut in this case, since the parents are both homozygous for both traits, the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, F2 will be based on this.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: When both genes are dominant (C and B are dominant). Since the bird is CcBb, both alleles are dominant for both traits. So this phenotype is 9/16.\n\n2. Checkered brown: When C is dominant, but B is recessive (so Bb). So CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive. This is 3/16.\n\n3. Plain red: When c is dominant for the first gene, and B is recessive (so Bb). So ccBb \u2192 3/16.\n\n4. Plain brown: When both genes are recessive (ccBB). So 1/16.\n\nAdding these: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown.\n\nBut wait, the options provided don't include 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3 \u2192 No.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 No.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nSo option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the question, the options are labeled A through J, with each having different ratios.

The other parent is a plain brown bird, so their genotype is cc bb. \n\nThe traits involved are:\n- Checkered pattern: controlled by the dominant gene C.\n- Plain color: recessive allele c.\n- Red color: dominant gene B.\n- Brown color: recessive allele b.\n\nI need to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation and determine the phenotypic ratio based on the expected outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's think about the parents' genotypes:\n- Parent 1: CC BB\n  - Homozygous dominant for both C and B.\n  - Since C is dominant, all offspring will express the checkered pattern (C).\n  - B is dominant, so all offspring will be red (B).\n\n- Parent 2: cc bb\n  - Homozygous recessive for both c and b.\n  - All offspring will not have the checkered pattern (c).\n  - All offspring will be brown (b).\n\nSo, the F1 generation from this cross would be all checkered red birds because each egg or sperm would combine one dominant allele from each parent. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. So Parent 1 gives either C or C, and Parent 2 gives either c or c. But since they're both homozygous, the F1 should all be Cc and Bb? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong earlier.\n\nWait, actually, when you cross CC BB with cc bb, the F1 should all be Cc Bb. Because each parent can only contribute one allele, but since they're homozygous, all offspring get the same combination. So F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions F2 generation, so perhaps I need to look at the dihybrid cross between F1 and F1, but no\u2014the initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 as Cc Bb. Then, F1 x F1 would produce F2. However, the options provided suggest that the answer is for the F2 generation.\n\nLet me correct my approach. The initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1 as Cc Bb. Then, F1 x F1 produces F2.\n\nSo, the F2 generation would involve the dihybrid cross of Cc Bb x Cc Bb. To find the phenotypic ratio, I'll need to consider the possible gametes and then the Punnett square.\n\nEach parent can produce four types of gametes:\n- C B (from Cc)\n- C b (from Cc)\n- c B (from cc)\n- c b (from cc)\n\nWait, actually, correction: Parent 1 (Cc Bb) can produce gametes:\n- C B (25%)\n- C b (25%)\n- c B (25%)\n- c b (25%)\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (Cc Bb) also can produce those four gametes.\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from combining these gametes. Each F1 (Cc Bb) can produce any of the four types equally.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, I'll calculate the probabilities of each genotype and then map them to phenotype.\n\nPhenotype depends on both alleles for each trait:\n\n- Pattern: C = checkered, c = plain.\n- Color: B = red, b = brown.\n\nSince both genes are independently assorting, we can use a Punnett square to determine the genotypic distribution, then convert that to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, using a dihybrid cross formula where the probability of each genotype is calculated as (number of each type)/(total). \n\nFor two genes with two alleles each, the number of possible genotypic combinations is 16. Using a Punnett square, each of the 16 combinations has equal probability if the parents are heterozygous.\n\nSo, the F2 generation's genotypic ratio is 1:2:1:2:1:2:1:2 (for each trait), but combined for both traits.\n\nWait, more accurately, each gene's segregation is independent. For each gene, the segregating ratio is 3:1 (since each parent is heterozygous). Combining two independent genes, the total genotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 (for two genes). No, wait, that's for a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, each gene's segregation is 3:1, so for two genes, it's 9:3:3:1. But I might be mixing up terms here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations. For each gene, there are three possibilities: dominant (e.g., B) or recessive (e.g., b). Since both genes are acting independently, each combination is 1/4 chance for each gene. So overall, 1/16 chance for each combination.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both patterns dominant (C_B_): checkered red.\n2. Checkered red with recessive color (C_bb): checkered brown.\n3. Plural patterns dominant (ccBB): plain red.\n4. Plural patterns dominant with recessive color (ccBb): plain brown.\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nThe number of each genotype in the F2:\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n- CC : 25%\n- Cc : 50%\n- cc : 25%\n\nSecond gene (B/b):\n- BB : 25%\n- Bb : 50%\n- bb : 25%\n\nCombined, the genotypic ratios are:\n\nCC BB : 1/16\nCC Bb : 2/16\nCC bb : 1/16\nCc BB : 2/16\nCc Bb : 4/16\nCc bb : 2/16\ncc BB : 1/16\ncc Bb : 2/16\ncc bb : 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Actually, the correct way is to multiply the probabilities for each gene. For each combination, the probability is (probability for first gene) * (probability for second gene).\n\nSo, for example:\n- CC BB: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n- CC bb: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n- Cc bb: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n- cc BB: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n- cc bb: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 100%, confirming the calculation.\n\nNow, converting these genotypic ratios to phenotypic ratios:\n\n- CC BB (checkered red): 6.25% \u2192 red checkered\n- CC Bb (checkered brown): 12.5% \u2192 brown checkered\n- CC bb (plain red): 6.25% \u2192 red plain\n- Cc BB (red brown): 12.5% \u2192 brown\n- Cc Bb (red brown): 25% \u2192 brown\n- Cc bb (plain brown): 12.5% \u2192 brown\n- cc BB (plain red): 6.25% \u2192 red plain\n- cc Bb (plain brown): 12.5% \u2192 brown\n- cc bb (plain blue?) Wait, no\u2014if the second gene is 'b', which is brown, then cc bb should be plain brown.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The second gene is 'b' for brown. So:\n\ncc BB: both recessive for the second gene, so brown plain?\nWait no, the second gene is 'b'. So, if both alleles are 'b', the phenotype is brown regardless of the first gene.\n\nSo:\n\ncc BB: checkered (C) + brown (b) \u2192 plain brown (brown, checkered)\ncc Bb: same as above, but also Bb. Wait, no\u2014it's just cc and Bb. Wait, no, in the F2, each bird is a combination of both genes. So:\n\nLooking back, the phenotypes are determined by both genes.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\nIf C is present (either C or Cc), and B is present (either B or Bb), then they are red-brown.\n\nIf C is present, but b (so Bb), they are red-brown.\n\nIf C is absent (cc), then:\n\nIf B is present (B or Bb), they are brown plain.\n\nIf B is absent (bb), they are brown plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I confused the letters. Let me clarify:\n\n- Gene 1: C (dominant) vs c (recessive)\n- Gene 2: B (dominant) vs b (recessive)\n\nSo, phenotype depends on both:\n\n- If C is present (i.e., at least one C allele), then:\n\n   - If B is present (at least one B allele), phenotype is red.\n\n   - If B is absent (only b), phenotype is brown.\n\n- If C is not present (cc), regardless of B:\n\n   - If B is present (B or Bb), phenotype is brown.\n\n   - If B is absent (bb), phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the presence of dominant alleles overrides the recessive ones. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present, phenotype is red.\n\n- If C is present but B is absent, phenotype is brown.\n\n- If C is absent (cc), then:\n\n   - If B is present (B or Bb), phenotype is brown.\n\n   - If B is absent (bb), phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWait, that still seems off because if C is absent, the phenotype is determined by B.\n\nNo, wait, the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene determines the phenotype.\n\nSo:\n\n- For Gene 1 (C):\n\n   - Dominant (C) \u2192 C allele present \u2192 phenotype based on Gene 2.\n\n   - Recessive (c) \u2192 phenotype based solely on Gene 2.\n\nSame applies for Gene 2 (B):\n\n   - Dominant (B) \u2192 phenotype based on Gene 1.\n\n   - Recessive (b) \u2192 phenotype based on Gene 1.\n\nTherefore, the overall phenotype is determined by whether any dominant allele is present in either gene.\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have two birds crossed in an adhybrid cross. One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means their genotype is CC BB. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so their genotype is cc bb. \n\nThe traits involved are:\n- Checkered pattern: controlled by the dominant gene C.\n- Plain color: recessive allele c.\n- Red color: dominant gene B.\n- Brown color: recessive allele b.\n\nI need to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation and determine the phenotypic ratio based on the expected outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's think about the parents' genotypes:\n- Parent 1: CC BB\n  - Homozygous dominant for both C and B.\n  - Since C is dominant, all offspring will express the checkered pattern (C).\n  - B is dominant, so all offspring will be red (B).\n\n- Parent 2: cc bb\n  - Homozygous recessive for both c and b.\n  - All offspring will not have the checkered pattern (c).\n  - All offspring will be brown (b).\n\nSo, the F1 generation from this cross would be all checkered red birds because each egg or sperm would combine one dominant allele from each parent. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. So Parent 1 gives either C or C, and Parent 2 gives either c or c. But since they're both homozygous, the F1 should all be Cc and Bb? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong earlier.\n\nWait, actually, when you cross CC BB with cc bb, the F1 should all be Cc Bb. Because each parent can only contribute one allele, but since they're homozygous, all offspring get the same combination. So F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions F2 generation, so perhaps I need to look at the dihybrid cross between F1 and F1, but no\u2014the initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 as Cc Bb. Then, F1 x F1 would produce F2. However, the options provided suggest that the answer is for the F2 generation.\n\nLet me correct my approach. The initial cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in F1 as Cc Bb. Then, F1 x F1 produces F2.\n\nSo, the F2 generation would involve the dihybrid cross of Cc Bb x Cc Bb. To find the phenotypic ratio, I'll need to consider the possible gametes and then the Punnett square.\n\nEach parent can produce four types of gametes:\n- C B (from Cc)\n- C b (from Cc)\n- c B (from cc)\n- c b (from cc)\n\nWait, actually, correction: Parent 1 (Cc Bb) can produce gametes:\n- C B (25%)\n- C b (25%)\n- c B (25%)\n- c b (25%)\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (Cc Bb) also can produce those four gametes.\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from combining these gametes. Each F1 (Cc Bb) can produce any of the four types equally.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, I'll calculate the probabilities of each genotype and then map them to phenotype.\n\nPhenotype depends on both alleles for each trait:\n\n- Pattern: C = checkered, c = plain.\n- Color: B = red, b = brown.\n\nSince both genes are independently assorting, we can use a Punnett square to determine the genotypic distribution, then convert that to phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, using a dihybrid cross formula where the probability of each genotype is calculated as (number of each type)/(total). \n\nFor two genes with two alleles each, the number of possible genotypic combinations is 16. Using a Punnett square, each of the 16 combinations has equal probability if the parents are heterozygous.\n\nSo, the F2 generation's genotypic ratio is 1:2:1:2:1:2:1:2 (for each trait), but combined for both traits.\n\nWait, more accurately, each gene's segregation is independent. For each gene, the segregating ratio is 3:1 (since each parent is heterozygous). Combining two independent genes, the total genotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 (for two genes). No, wait, that's for a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, each gene's segregation is 3:1, so for two genes, it's 9:3:3:1. But I might be mixing up terms here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible combinations. For each gene, there are three possibilities: dominant (e.g., B) or recessive (e.g., b). Since both genes are acting independently, each combination is 1/4 chance for each gene. So overall, 1/16 chance for each combination.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both patterns dominant (C_B_): checkered red.\n2. Checkered red with recessive color (C_bb): checkered brown.\n3. Plural patterns dominant (ccBB): plain red.\n4. Plural patterns dominant with recessive color (ccBb): plain brown.\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nThe number of each genotype in the F2:\n\nFor the first gene (C/c):\n- CC : 25%\n- Cc : 50%\n- cc : 25%\n\nSecond gene (B/b):\n- BB : 25%\n- Bb : 50%\n- bb : 25%\n\nCombined, the genotypic ratios are:\n\nCC BB : 1/16\nCC Bb : 2/16\nCC bb : 1/16\nCc BB : 2/16\nCc Bb : 4/16\nCc bb : 2/16\ncc BB : 1/16\ncc Bb : 2/16\ncc bb : 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Actually, the correct way is to multiply the probabilities for each gene. For each combination, the probability is (probability for first gene) * (probability for second gene).\n\nSo, for example:\n- CC BB: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n- CC bb: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n- Cc bb: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n- cc BB: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n- cc bb: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 100%, confirming the calculation.\n\nNow, converting these genotypic ratios to phenotypic ratios:\n\n- CC BB (checkered red): 6.25% \u2192 red checkered\n- CC Bb (checkered brown): 12.5% \u2192 brown checkered\n- CC bb (plain red): 6.25% \u2192 red plain\n- Cc BB (red brown): 12.5% \u2192 brown\n- Cc Bb (red brown): 25% \u2192 brown\n- Cc bb (plain brown): 12.5% \u2192 brown\n- cc BB (plain red): 6.25% \u2192 red plain\n- cc Bb (plain brown): 12.5% \u2192 brown\n- cc bb (plain blue?) Wait, no\u2014if the second gene is 'b', which is brown, then cc bb should be plain brown.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The second gene is 'b' for brown. So:\n\ncc BB: both recessive for the second gene, so brown plain?\nWait no, the second gene is 'b'. So, if both alleles are 'b', the phenotype is brown regardless of the first gene.\n\nSo:\n\ncc BB: checkered (C) + brown (b) \u2192 plain brown (brown, checkered)\ncc Bb: same as above, but also Bb. Wait, no\u2014it's just cc and Bb. Wait, no, in the F2, each bird is a combination of both genes. So:\n\nLooking back, the phenotypes are determined by both genes.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\nIf C is present (either C or Cc), and B is present (either B or Bb), then they are red-brown.\n\nIf C is present, but b (so Bb), they are red-brown.\n\nIf C is absent (cc), then:\n\nIf B is present (B or Bb), they are brown plain.\n\nIf B is absent (bb), they are brown plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I confused the letters. Let me clarify:\n\n- Gene 1: C (dominant) vs c (recessive)\n- Gene 2: B (dominant) vs b (recessive)\n\nSo, phenotype depends on both:\n\n- If C is present (i.e., at least one C allele), then:\n\n   - If B is present (at least one B allele), phenotype is red.\n\n   - If B is absent (only b), phenotype is brown.\n\n- If C is not present (cc), regardless of B:\n\n   - If B is present (B or Bb), phenotype is brown.\n\n   - If B is absent (bb), phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the presence of dominant alleles overrides the recessive ones. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present, phenotype is red.\n\n- If C is present but B is absent, phenotype is brown.\n\n- If C is absent (cc), then:\n\n   - If B is present (B or Bb), phenotype is brown.\n\n   - If B is absent (bb), phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWait, that still seems off because if C is absent, the phenotype is determined by B.\n\nNo, wait, the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene determines the phenotype.\n\nSo:\n\n- For Gene 1 (C):\n\n   - Dominant (C) \u2192 C allele present \u2192 phenotype based on Gene 2.\n\n   - Recessive (c) \u2192 phenotype based solely on Gene 2.\n\nSame applies for Gene 2 (B):\n\n   - Dominant (B) \u2192 phenotype based on Gene 1.\n\n   - Recessive (b) \u2192 phenotype based on Gene 1.\n\nTherefore, the overall phenotype is determined by whether any dominant allele is present in either gene.\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele in Gene 1 or Gene 2 \u2192 red or brown.\n\n2. Only recessive alleles in both genes \u2192 plain.\n\nWait, but how do the colors work?\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red, regardless of B.\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown, regardless of C.\n\n- Recessive c and b \u2192 plain.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene.\n\nTherefore:\n\nPhenotype:\n\n- If either C or B is dominant \u2192 red or brown.\n\n- If both C and B are recessive \u2192 plain.\n\nSo, now mapping the F2 genotypic ratios to phenotypes:\n\nFrom the earlier calculations:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | red checkered\nCC Bb | red brown\nCC bb | red plain\nCc BB | brown checkered\nCc Bb | brown brown (wait, no\u2014because B is dominant, so if B is present, phenotype is brown. Similarly for Bb.)\nCc bb | brown plain\ncc BB | plain brown\ncc Bb | plain brown\ncc bb | plain brown\n\nWait, but for cc (recessive in both genes), the phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWait, no, because if both genes are recessive, then the phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014both recessive in both genes would mean both alleles are recessive, so phenotype is plain brown.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nIn F2, for each bird:\n\n- If at least one dominant allele (C or B) is present \u2192 red or brown.\n\n- Else \u2192 plain brown.\n\nSo, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red checkered (C and B)\n- CC Bb: red brown (C and B)\n- CC bb: red plain (C and b)\n- Cc BB: brown checkered (B and B)\n- Cc Bb: brown brown (B and B)\n- Cc bb: brown plain (B and b)\n- cc BB: plain brown (c and B)\n- cc Bb: plain brown (c and B)\n- cc bb: plain brown (c and b)\n\nWait, but in reality, when both genes are recessive (cc bb), the phenotype is plain brown, not brown checkered or anything else.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\nRed checkered: CC BB \u2192 1/16 \u2192 ~6.25%\n\nRed brown: CC Bb + Cc BB + Cc Bb \u2192 (1+2+4)/16=7/16 \u224843.75%\n\nRed plain: CC bb + Cc BB + Cc bb \u2192 (1+2+2)/16=5/16\u224831.25%\n\nBrown checkered: Cc BB \u2192 2/16\u219212.5%\n\nBrown brown: Cc Bb \u21924/16\u219225%\n\nBrown plain: Cc bb + cc BB + cc Bb + cc bb \u2192 (2+1+1+1)/16=5/16\u224831.25%\n\nWait, hold on, that adds up to 100%.\n\nWait, CC BB is red checkered.\n\nCC Bb and Cc BB and Cc Bb are red brown.\n\nCC bb, Cc BB, Cc bb: CC bb is red plain, Cc BB is brown checkered, Cc bb is brown plain.\n\nThen, cc BB is plain brown, cc Bb is plain brown, cc bb is plain brown.\n\nWait, so the counts are:\n\n- red checkered: 1\n- red brown: 2 + 2 + 1 =5?

They're alsoplain colored because of a recessive allele c. So the genotype would be something like Cc or CC if they're not necessarily showing both traits.\n\nThen there's another bird that's plain brown. It has a recessive allele b for brown color and a dominant B for red. So their genotype should be bbB_? Wait, no\u2014wait. Actually, since the phenotype is plain brown, which is determined by the recessive alleles, the bird must be homozygous recessive in terms of the brown trait. But wait, the other bird is checkered red, which is C c maybe? Or perhaps CC and cc?\n\nWait, let me get this straight. The first bird is a checkered pattern, which implies it's C c because checkered is usually due to two different alleles. So the first bird is C c, right? And it's red. Wait, but the problem says it's checkered red. Hmm, maybe it's actually C c and both are red? Wait, no, because red is determined by the B allele. So if the first bird is checkered red, then both its traits are red, meaning it must have the dominant B alleles. But wait, the problem states that checkered patterns are controlled by the dominant gene C, and red color is controlled by B. So perhaps the first bird is CC, because it's checkered, meaning it's heterozygous for the C trait, but since it's red, both alleles must be B. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because CC and BB would be black. Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Red color: B (dominant)\n- Brown color: b (recessive)\n\nSo each bird's genotype can be represented as Cc (for the pattern) and BB (for the color).

Homozygous checkered red would mean both alleles are C and R. Wait, but R isn't mentioned in the genes given. Oh, wait, the genes are B and b for color and C and c for pattern. So the first bird is homozygous for the pattern, which is C, and the color is red, which is B. So the genotype would be C C B B. Similarly, the second bird is plain brown, so it's c c for pattern, and b b for color. So their genotype is c c b b.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting because the first bird is supposed to be a checkered pattern, which would imply two different alleles, but if it's homozygous, that's impossible. Unless I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"homozygous checkered\" refers to the same color, but different patterns. Wait, but the color is determined by B and b. So perhaps the first bird is CC (pattern-wise) and BB (color-wise), making it checkered red. The second bird is cc (pattern-wise) and bb (color-wise), making it plain brown.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC (pattern) BB (color) \u2192 Cc and BB? Wait, no. Wait, the first bird is a checkered pattern, which would be C c (heterozygous for pattern), and both B and B (so BB for color). So its genotype is CcBB.\n\nParent 2: It's a plain brown bird. So for pattern, it's cc (since plain is recessive), and for color, it's bb (brown is recessive). So its genotype is ccbb.\n\nNow, we need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross. Wait, but what type of cross is this? Since each parent contributes gametes, and we're considering F2 generation after some crosses.\n\nWait, let me see. The question says to complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Then, for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, etc., for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but adihybrid crosses are typically for dihybrids, like AaBb x AaBb. But here, we have a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps we're looking at a self-pollination or a cross where each parent is homozygous, leading to F2 generation.\n\nWait, no, the parents are homozygous. So when you cross two homozygotes, you get a dihybrid, but the F2 comes from crossing a dihybrid with another dihybrid. But the question mentions an adihybridcross, which usually refers to dihybrid crosses, so perhaps the cross is between a dihybrid and a monohybrid or something else. Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we're considering the cross of a homozygote (CCBB) and another homozygote (ccbb), resulting in CcBb. Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from that cross.\n\nBut let me structure this properly.\n\nFirst, identify the genotypes of the parents:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC (pattern-wise) BB (color-wise) \u2192 Cc and BB? No, wait. The correct way is that the bird is homozygous for the pattern, so it's CC (assuming 'checkered' refers to the pattern, which is usually a single allele), and homozygous for color, so BB (red). So its genotype is CC BB \u2192 Cc and BB? Wait, no. Each bird has two alleles, so if it's homozygous for the pattern, it's CC, and homozygous for color, it's BB. So its genotype is CcBB? Wait, no\u2014that's confusing. Wait, the bird is homozygous for the pattern, so both alleles are C. For the color, being red, which is dominant, the bird must have at least one B allele. But if it's homozygous for color, then both alleles are B. So its genotype is CcBB? That doesn't seem right. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles, so for the pattern, it's CC (homozygous dominant for pattern), and for color, it's BB (homozygous dominant for red). So the genotype is CcBB? No, wait\u2014it's either CC or cc for pattern, and BB or bb for color. So the first parent is CC (pattern) and BB (color), so its genotype is CcBB? No, that's not possible. Wait, the bird is homozygous for both traits, so both alleles are present. So it's CC (pattern) and BB (color). So the genotype is CcBB? No, wait\u2014I think I'm mixing up notation. Let me represent each trait separately. For the pattern, C is dominant, so the bird could be CC orCc. For color, B is dominant, so the bird could be BB or Bb. Therefore, the first parent is homozygous for both traits, so it's CC BB \u2192 Cc and BB? Wait, no. Each bird has two alleles, so the first parent is CC for pattern and BB for color, so its genotype is CcBB? No, that's not correct. Wait, each bird is diploid, so the first parent is CC for pattern and BB for color, so its genotype is CcBB? No, that's incorrect. Wait, each bird has two alleles, so the first parent is CC (pattern) and BB (color), so the genotype is CcBB? No, that's not right. Wait, no\u2014if the first parent is homozygous for both traits, then its genotype is CcBB? No, that can't be. Wait, no, the bird is CC (pattern) and BB (color), so its genotype is CcBB? No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the letters are used. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird has two alleles, so for the first parent, who is homozygous checkered red, that would mean both alleles are C (for pattern) and B (for color), making its genotype CcBB. Wait, but that's four letters. Wait, no, each trait is separate. So for the first parent, the pattern is checkedered, so both alleles are C. The color is red, which is dominant, so both alleles are B. So its genotype is CcBB? No, that's not possible. Wait, no\u2014a bird can't have two alleles for both traits simultaneously unless it's a codominant situation, but in reality, each trait is determined independently. So the first parent's genotype is CC (for pattern) and BB (for color), making its genotype CcBB? No, that's still ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to represent each trait separately. So the first parent is CC (for pattern, dominant) and BB (for color, dominant), so its genotype is CcBB? No, that doesn't make sense because each bird has two alleles. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me simplify.\n\nFor the first parent:\n- Pattern: Checkered, which is dominant. So it's either CC or Cc.\n- Color: Red, dominant. So it's either BB or Bb.\n\nSince it's homozygous checkered red, both alleles must be dominant. So the first parent is CC (for pattern) and BB (for color), making its genotype CC BB.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is plain brown. For the pattern, it's recessive, so it's cc. For the color, it's brown, which is recessive, so it's bb. Thus, its genotype is cc bb.\n\nNow, we'll create a Punnett square for the F1 generation, assuming these two parents mate.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (genotype)\nParent 2: cc bb (genotype)\n\nWhen they mate, each allele from Parent 1 combines with each allele from Parent 2.\n\nThe F1 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFrom Parent 1's C and Parent 2's c: Cc (since C + c = Cc)\nFrom Parent 1's C and Parent 2's b: Cb\nFrom Parent 1's c and Parent 2's c: cc\nFrom Parent 1's c and Parent 2's b: cb\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are Cc, Cb, cc, and cb.\n\nWait, but the question asks about the F2 generation, which suggests that we're considering the F1 parents for further selfing or interbreeding. Alternatively, perhaps we're considering the initial cross as F1 and then proceeding to F2.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross is between a homozygous parent (CCBB) and a non-homogeneous parent (ccbb), leading to F1 that are CcBb. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is between a homozygous parent (CCBB) and itself, leading to F1 that are CcBb, and then F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nIn any case, let's proceed under the assumption that we're looking at the F2 generation of the cross between CCBB and ccbb.\n\nFirst, determine the genotypes of the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nWait, no. Let's start with the cross:\n\nParent 1: CCBB (CC for pattern, BB for color)\nParent 2: ccbb (cc for pattern, bb for color)\n\nThey will produce F1 offspring. Each parent contributes one allele for each trait.\n\nFor the pattern trait:\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\nPossible combinations: Cc\n\nFor the color trait:\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\nPossible combinations: Bb\n\nThus, F1 genotypes are all CcBb.\n\nNow, F1 selfs to produce F2:\n\nEach F1 individual (CcBb) will produce gametes according to Mendel's laws.\n\nFor the pattern trait (C/c):\nParent Cc will produce C and c alleles in equal frequency (50% each).\n\nFor the color trait (B/b):\nParent Cc will produce B and b in equal frequency (50% each).\n\nThus, each gamete from F1 is a combination of one allele from each trait.\n\nSo F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nPattern trait:\n- C (from Cc) combined with C (from Cc): CC (25%)\n- C combined with c: Cc (50%)\n- c combined with C: Cc (50%)\n- c combined with c: cc (25%)\n\nColor trait:\n- B (from Cc) combined with B (from Cc): BB (25%)\n- B combined with b: Bb (50%)\n- b combined with B: Bb (50%)\n- b combined with b: bb (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these, leading to 16 possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes based on the given rules:\n\n- Pattern (C/c):\n   - C: checkered\n   - c: plain\n- Color (B/b):\n   - B: red\n   - b: brown\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 individuals and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Individuals 4, 5 \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: Individuals 2, 3, 6 \u2192 3\n- Plain red: Individual 7 \u2192 1\n- Plain brown: Individuals 8, 9 \u2192 2\n\nWait, but checking the counts:\n\nLooking back:\n\nWait, individual 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\nIndividual 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nIndividual 3: CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nIndividual 4: Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\nIndividual 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\nIndividual 6: Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nIndividual 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red\nIndividual 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\nIndividual 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo,\n\nCheckered red: individuals 1,4,5 \u2192 3\nCheckered brown: individuals 2,3,6 \u2192 3\nPlain red: individual 7 \u2192 1\nPlain brown: individuals 8,9 \u2192 2\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+3+1+2=9. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 2,3,1,2, which totals 8. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the list above:\n\nCheckered red: 1 (CC BB), 4 (Cc BB), 5 (Cc Bb) \u2192 3\n\nCheckered brown: 2 (CC Bb), 3 (CC bb), 6 (Cc bb) \u2192 3\n\nPlain red: 7 (cc BB) \u2192 1\n\nPlain brown: 8 (cc Bb), 9 (cc bb) \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a different count, thinking 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown, totaling 9. But let me verify each individual:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (C and c; B and B \u2192 Checkered red)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (C and c; B and b)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (C and c; b and b)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (Cc; BB)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (Cc; Bb)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (Cc; bb)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (cc; BB)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (cc; Bb)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (cc; bb)\n\nSo yes, that's 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown. Total 9 individuals.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is 3:3:1:2, but looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 total 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 total 16.\n\nWait, our calculation shows 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 2 plain brown. So none of the options match exactly. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me double-check the F2 calculations.\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces gametes:\n\nFor pattern (C/c):\n\n50% C, 50% c\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, each gamete is a combination of one allele from each trait.\n\nNumber of possible gametes:\n\n4 types: CB, Cb, cB, cb\n\nEach occurs 25% of the time.\n\nF2 will have 16 possible combinations:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe question involves two birds, one that's a checkered pattern with a dominant gene C, which means it's always going to have the uppercase C allele. They're alsoplain colored because of a recessive allele c. So the genotype would be something like Cc or CC if they're not necessarily showing both traits.\n\nThen there's another bird that's plain brown. It has a recessive allele b for brown color and a dominant B for red. So their genotype should be bbB_? Wait, no\u2014wait. Actually, since the phenotype is plain brown, which is determined by the recessive alleles, the bird must be homozygous recessive in terms of the brown trait. But wait, the other bird is checkered red, which is C c maybe? Or perhaps CC and cc?\n\nWait, let me get this straight. The first bird is a checkered pattern, which implies it's C c because checkered is usually due to two different alleles. So the first bird is C c, right? And it's red. Wait, but the problem says it's checkered red. Hmm, maybe it's actually C c and both are red? Wait, no, because red is determined by the B allele. So if the first bird is checkered red, then both its traits are red, meaning it must have the dominant B alleles. But wait, the problem states that checkered patterns are controlled by the dominant gene C, and red color is controlled by B. So perhaps the first bird is CC, because it's checkered, meaning it's heterozygous for the C trait, but since it's red, both alleles must be B. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because CC and BB would be black. Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- Checkered pattern: C (dominant)\n- Plain color: c (recessive)\n- Red color: B (dominant)\n- Brown color: b (recessive)\n\nSo each bird's genotype can be represented as Cc (for the pattern) and BB (for the color). So the first parent is CC (but wait, that might not make sense). Wait, no\u2014the parents are birds that produce specific genotypes based on their parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Homozygous checkered red would mean both alleles are C and R. Wait, but R isn't mentioned in the genes given. Oh, wait, the genes are B and b for color and C and c for pattern. So the first bird is homozygous for the pattern, which is C, and the color is red, which is B. So the genotype would be C C B B. Similarly, the second bird is plain brown, so it's c c for pattern, and b b for color. So their genotype is c c b b.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting because the first bird is supposed to be a checkered pattern, which would imply two different alleles, but if it's homozygous, that's impossible. Unless I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"homozygous checkered\" refers to the same color, but different patterns. Wait, but the color is determined by B and b. So perhaps the first bird is CC (pattern-wise) and BB (color-wise), making it checkered red. The second bird is cc (pattern-wise) and bb (color-wise), making it plain brown.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC (pattern) BB (color) \u2192 Cc and BB? Wait, no. Wait, the first bird is a checkered pattern, which would be C c (heterozygous for pattern), and both B and B (so BB for color). So its genotype is CcBB.\n\nParent 2: It's a plain brown bird. So for pattern, it's cc (since plain is recessive), and for color, it's bb (brown is recessive). So its genotype is ccbb.\n\nNow, we need to create a Punnett square for an adihybrid cross.

So it's either BB or Bb.\n\nSince it's homozygous checkered red, both alleles must be dominant.

For the color, it's brown, which is recessive, so it's bb. Thus, its genotype is cc bb.\n\nNow, we'll create a Punnett square for the F1 generation, assuming these two parents mate.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (genotype)\nParent 2: cc bb (genotype)\n\nWhen they mate, each allele from Parent 1 combines with each allele from Parent 2.\n\nThe F1 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFrom Parent 1's C and Parent 2's c: Cc (since C + c = Cc)\nFrom Parent 1's C and Parent 2's b: Cb\nFrom Parent 1's c and Parent 2's c: cc\nFrom Parent 1's c and Parent 2's b: cb\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are Cc, Cb, cc, and cb.\n\nWait, but the question asks about the F2 generation, which suggests that we're considering the F1 parents for further selfing or interbreeding.

Let's start with the cross:\n\nParent 1: CCBB (CC for pattern, BB for color)\nParent 2: ccbb (cc for pattern, bb for color)\n\nThey will produce F1 offspring. Each parent contributes one allele for each trait.\n\nFor the pattern trait:\nParent 1: C\nParent 2: c\nPossible combinations: Cc\n\nFor the color trait:\nParent 1: B\nParent 2: b\nPossible combinations: Bb\n\nThus, F1 genotypes are all CcBb.\n\nNow, F1 selfs to produce F2:\n\nEach F1 individual (CcBb) will produce gametes according to Mendel's laws.\n\nFor the pattern trait (C/c):\nParent Cc will produce C and c alleles in equal frequency (50% each).\n\nFor the color trait (B/b):\nParent Cc will produce B and b in equal frequency (50% each).\n\nThus, each gamete from F1 is a combination of one allele from each trait.\n\nSo F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nPattern trait:\n- C (from Cc) combined with C (from Cc): CC (25%)\n- C combined with c: Cc (50%)\n- c combined with C: Cc (50%)\n- c combined with c: cc (25%)\n\nColor trait:\n- B (from Cc) combined with B (from Cc): BB (25%)\n- B combined with b: Bb (50%)\n- b combined with B: Bb (50%)\n- b combined with b: bb (25%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these, leading to 16 possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes based on the given rules:\n\n- Pattern (C/c):\n   - C: checkered\n   - c: plain\n- Color (B/b):\n   - B: red\n   - b: brown\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 individuals and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Individuals 4, 5 \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: Individuals 2, 3, 6 \u2192 3\n- Plain red: Individual 7 \u2192 1\n- Plain brown: Individuals 8, 9 \u2192 2\n\nWait, but checking the counts:\n\nLooking back:\n\nWait, individual 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\nIndividual 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nIndividual 3: CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nIndividual 4: Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\nIndividual 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\nIndividual 6: Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nIndividual 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red\nIndividual 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\nIndividual 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo,\n\nCheckered red: individuals 1,4,5 \u2192 3\nCheckered brown: individuals 2,3,6 \u2192 3\nPlain red: individual 7 \u2192 1\nPlain brown: individuals 8,9 \u2192 2\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+3+1+2=9. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 2,3,1,2, which totals 8. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the list above:\n\nCheckered red: 1 (CC BB), 4 (Cc BB), 5 (Cc Bb) \u2192 3\n\nCheckered brown: 2 (CC Bb), 3 (CC bb), 6 (Cc bb) \u2192 3\n\nPlain red: 7 (cc BB) \u2192 1\n\nPlain brown: 8 (cc Bb), 9 (cc bb) \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a different count, thinking 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown, totaling 9. But let me verify each individual:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (C and c; B and B \u2192 Checkered red)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (C and c; B and b)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (C and c; b and b)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (Cc; BB)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (Cc; Bb)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (Cc; bb)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (cc; BB)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (cc; Bb)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (cc; bb)\n\nSo yes, that's 3 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 Plain red, 2 Plain brown. Total 9 individuals.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is 3:3:1:2, but looking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 total 16.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 total 16.\n\nWait, our calculation shows 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 2 plain brown. So none of the options match exactly. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me double-check the F2 calculations.\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces gametes:\n\nFor pattern (C/c):\n\n50% C, 50% c\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, each gamete is a combination of one allele from each trait.\n\nNumber of possible gametes:\n\n4 types: CB, Cb, cB, cb\n\nEach occurs 25% of the time.\n\nF2 will have 16 possible combinations:\n\n1.

    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's being asked here. There are two birds involved in an adihybrid cross\u2014wait, no, actually, it says a dihybrid cross because there are two genes involved: one affecting the color (B and b) and another affecting the pattern (C and c). The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nLet me break down the information:\n\n- The first parent is CC BB. Since it's homozygous, both alleles must be the same. So, the bird has the genotype CC for the pigmentation gene and BB for the color gene.\n  \n- The second parent is cc bb. Similarly, this is homozygous, so their genotype is cc for pigment and bb for color.\n\nThe goal is to create a Punnett square for an F2 generation and determine the phenotypic ratio based on the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how these two birds will produce gametes. Each bird is diploid for each gene, but since they're homozygous, all their gametes will carry the same allele.\n\nFor the pigmentation gene (C and c):\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 can only produce gametes with C (since they're homozygous)\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 can only produce gametes with c\n\nSo, all F1 (from crossing these parents) will be Cc for the pigment gene.\n\nFor the color gene (B and b):\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 can only produce gametes with B\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 can only produce gametes with b\n\nSo, all F1 will be Bb for the color gene.\n\nTherefore, when we cross these two F1 (CcBb), each bird will produce four types of gametes:\n- CB (C from parent 1, B from parent 2)\n- Cb (C from parent 1, b from parent 2)\n- cb (c from parent 1, B from parent 2)\n- cc (c from parent 1, b from parent 2)\n\nWait, that seems off. Hold on, if Parent 1 is Cc and Parent 2 is Bb, then their gametes should be combinations of these. But wait, Parent 1 is CC, so they can't produce any c. Parent 2 is cc, so they can only produce c. Therefore, the F1 would have all possible combinations:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC): C\nFrom Parent 2 (cc): c\n\nSo, F1 for each gene is Cc and Bb respectively? Wait, no. Because the parents are different for each gene. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the cross is between CC BB and cc bb. So, for the pigment gene (C/c), Parent 1 is CC, so all gametes are C. Parent 2 is cc, so all gametes are c. Thus, F1 will be Cc.\n\nFor the color gene (B/b), Parent 1 is BB, so all gametes are B. Parent 2 is bb, so all gametes are b. Thus, F1 will be Bb.\n\nSo, each F1 bird will be CcBb. Now, when they self-pollinate (to get F2), each bird will produce four types of gametes:\n\nFrom CcBb:\n- C (from C) + B \u2192 CB\n- C + b \u2192 Cb\n- c + B \u2192 cB\n- c + b \u2192 cb\n\nThus, the F2 generation will consist of these gametes combined in all possible ways.\n\nNow, let's think about the phenotypes. The phenotype depends on both the pigment (C) and the color (B).\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when the bird is Cc (pigment) and Bb (color). So, the genotype is CcBb. The phenotype will display both traits as red and checkered.\n\n- Checkered brown: This happens when pigment is Cc but color is bb. So, genotype is Ccbb. Phenotype is brown and checkered.\n\n- Plain red: Pigment is cc (no pigment), so regardless of color, the bird is plain red. Genotype is ccBb.\n\n- Plain brown: Pigment is cc, color is bb. Genotype is ccbb. Phenotype is brown and plain.\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nEach F2 bird is formed by combining gametes from F1 (which are all CcBb). When you cross F1 x F1, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (pigment) + BB (color) \u2192 CCBB (checkered red)\n- CC + Bb \u2192 CCBb (checkered brown)\n- CC + bb \u2192 Ccbb (plain brown)\n- Cc (pigment) + BB \u2192 CcBB (checkered red)\n- Cc + Bb \u2192 CcBb (checkered red)\n- Cc + bb \u2192 Ccbb (plain brown)\n- cB (pigment) + BB \u2192 cBBB (plain red)\n- cB + Bb \u2192 cB Bb (plain red)\n- cB + bb \u2192 cbbB (plain red)\n- cc (pigment) + BB \u2192 ccBB (plain red)\n- cc + Bb \u2192 ccBb (plain red)\n- cc + bb \u2192 ccbb (plain brown)\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, using Punnett squares directly might help.\n\nAlternatively, considering each gene separately and then combining the results.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- CC (pigment) : probability (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n- Cc (pigment) : 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2\n- cc (pigment) : 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the color gene (B/b):\n\n- BB (color) : 1/4\n- Bb (color) : 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2\n- bb (color) : 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products.\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by both genes. We need to find the combination of pigment and color that leads to each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (CcBb)\n\nThis requires pigment (C) and color (B). So, the genotype is CcBb. The probability of this is:\n\nProbability of Cc (pigment) * Probability of Bb (color) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nSo, 1/4 chance of Checkered red.\n\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (Ccbb)\n\nThis requires pigment (C) and color (bb). So, genotype is Ccbb. Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nCheckered brown.\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (ccBb)\n\nThis requires color (bb) but not pigment (cc). So, genotype is ccBb. Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPlain red.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nColor (bb) and no pigment (cc). Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPlain brown.\n\nWait, but the options given don't match exactly. The user provided options A through H, each with specific counts. Also, the initial setup mentions the F2 generation, which typically includes the genotypes and phenotypes after two rounds of crossing.\n\nHowever, in my calculation above, each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to reflect equal distribution. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me re-examine.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the combined probabilities multiply. However, the presence of both genes affects the phenotype, so the phenotypes may not be equally likely.\n\nWait, in reality, some genotypes might result in the same phenotype due to dominance or epistasis, but the question doesn't mention anything like that. It just says checkered red is CcBb, etc., implying that each genotype corresponds uniquely to a phenotype.\n\nAssuming no such complexities, each phenotype should have 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states 1,3,9,3. That's a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which suggests a tripling factor beyond simple Mendelian ratios. This usually comes from incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question doesn't indicate such.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the cross isn't between two F1s but between a F1 and a F2 or something else. Let me read again.\n\nNo, the problem states: \"a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, the parents are homozygous (checkered red is CC BB, plain brown is cc bb). They produce F1 which are CcBb. Then, the F1s are crossed to produce F2.\n\nIn that case, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nEach F1 bird produces four gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nCrossing F1 (CB, Cb, cB, cb) with F1 (same):\n\nAll combinations will be:\n\nCB x CB \u2192 CcBb\nCB x Cb \u2192 CcBb\nCB x cB \u2192 CcBb\nCB x cb \u2192 CcBb\nCb x CB \u2192 CcBb\nCb x Cb \u2192 CcBb\nCb x cB \u2192 CcBb\nCb x cb \u2192 CcBb\ncB x CB \u2192 CcBb\ncB x Cb \u2192 CcBb\ncB x cB \u2192 CcBb\ncB x cb \u2192 CcBb\ncb x CB \u2192 CcBb\ncb x Cb \u2192 CcBb\ncb x cB \u2192 CcBb\ncb x cb \u2192 CcBb\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The actual F2 genotypes from F1 x F1 would include all possible combinations where each parent contributes one allele. Each F1 bird can produce four gametes, so when crossed, there are 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations. Out of these, the number of each genotype is:\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CcBb: All possible combinations except when both alleles are c or when one is c and the other is b. Wait, actually, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (all others)\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n\nWait, that can't be right. Actually, in a dihybrid cross, each gene segregates independently, so the F2 genotypes are all CcBb except when there's a change in dominance, but since all are codominant, it's uniform.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing things. Let me approach this differently. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, assuming independent assortment and no dominance interactions. But in this case, we have specific phenotypes defined by dominant alleles.\n\nWait, the key point is that the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two genes. So, for the F2, the phenotypic ratio would depend on how many genotypes fall into each phenotype category.\n\nGiven the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (CcBb)\n2. Checkered brown (Ccbb)\n3. Plain red (ccBb)\n4. Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nNow, the probability for each:\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n\n- C (Cc): 3/4\n- c (cc): 1/4\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n- B (Bb): 3/4\n- b (bb): 1/4\n\nCombined probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, that gives a ratio of 9:3:3:1, matching the typical F2 dihybrid ratio without considering phenotypic expressions. However, in the answer options provided, none seem to fit this ratio. Let me look again:\n\nOptions A-F:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6+2=8; 6+2=8 \u2192 8:8 \u2192 1:1\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 12:4 \u2192 3:1\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 matches our calculation\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1+3=4; 9+3=12 \u2192 4:12 \u2192 1:3\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16 total, but individual ratios aren't clear\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 equal distribution\n\nOur calculation gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is option C.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here. There are two birds involved in an adihybrid cross\u2014wait, no, actually, it says a dihybrid cross because there are two genes involved: one affecting the color (B and b) and another affecting the pattern (C and c). The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\n\nLet me break down the information:\n\n- The first parent is CC BB. Since it's homozygous, both alleles must be the same. So, the bird has the genotype CC for the pigmentation gene and BB for the color gene.\n  \n- The second parent is cc bb. Similarly, this is homozygous, so their genotype is cc for pigment and bb for color.\n\nThe goal is to create a Punnett square for an F2 generation and determine the phenotypic ratio based on the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how these two birds will produce gametes. Each bird is diploid for each gene, but since they're homozygous, all their gametes will carry the same allele.\n\nFor the pigmentation gene (C and c):\n- Parent 1: CC \u2192 can only produce gametes with C (since they're homozygous)\n- Parent 2: cc \u2192 can only produce gametes with c\n\nSo, all F1 (from crossing these parents) will be Cc for the pigment gene.\n\nFor the color gene (B and b):\n- Parent 1: BB \u2192 can only produce gametes with B\n- Parent 2: bb \u2192 can only produce gametes with b\n\nSo, all F1 will be Bb for the color gene.\n\nTherefore, when we cross these two F1 (CcBb), each bird will produce four types of gametes:\n- CB (C from parent 1, B from parent 2)\n- Cb (C from parent 1, b from parent 2)\n- cb (c from parent 1, B from parent 2)\n- cc (c from parent 1, b from parent 2)\n\nWait, that seems off. Hold on, if Parent 1 is Cc and Parent 2 is Bb, then their gametes should be combinations of these. But wait, Parent 1 is CC, so they can't produce any c. Parent 2 is cc, so they can only produce c. Therefore, the F1 would have all possible combinations:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC): C\nFrom Parent 2 (cc): c\n\nSo, F1 for each gene is Cc and Bb respectively? Wait, no. Because the parents are different for each gene. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the cross is between CC BB and cc bb. So, for the pigment gene (C/c), Parent 1 is CC, so all gametes are C. Parent 2 is cc, so all gametes are c. Thus, F1 will be Cc.\n\nFor the color gene (B/b), Parent 1 is BB, so all gametes are B. Parent 2 is bb, so all gametes are b. Thus, F1 will be Bb.\n\nSo, each F1 bird will be CcBb. Now, when they self-pollinate (to get F2), each bird will produce four types of gametes:\n\nFrom CcBb:\n- C (from C) + B \u2192 CB\n- C + b \u2192 Cb\n- c + B \u2192 cB\n- c + b \u2192 cb\n\nThus, the F2 generation will consist of these gametes combined in all possible ways.\n\nNow, let's think about the phenotypes. The phenotype depends on both the pigment (C) and the color (B).\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when the bird is Cc (pigment) and Bb (color). So, the genotype is CcBb. The phenotype will display both traits as red and checkered.\n\n- Checkered brown: This happens when pigment is Cc but color is bb. So, genotype is Ccbb. Phenotype is brown and checkered.\n\n- Plain red: Pigment is cc (no pigment), so regardless of color, the bird is plain red. Genotype is ccBb.\n\n- Plain brown: Pigment is cc, color is bb. Genotype is ccbb. Phenotype is brown and plain.\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nEach F2 bird is formed by combining gametes from F1 (which are all CcBb). When you cross F1 x F1, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (pigment) + BB (color) \u2192 CCBB (checkered red)\n- CC + Bb \u2192 CCBb (checkered brown)\n- CC + bb \u2192 Ccbb (plain brown)\n- Cc (pigment) + BB \u2192 CcBB (checkered red)\n- Cc + Bb \u2192 CcBb (checkered red)\n- Cc + bb \u2192 Ccbb (plain brown)\n- cB (pigment) + BB \u2192 cBBB (plain red)\n- cB + Bb \u2192 cB Bb (plain red)\n- cB + bb \u2192 cbbB (plain red)\n- cc (pigment) + BB \u2192 ccBB (plain red)\n- cc + Bb \u2192 ccBb (plain red)\n- cc + bb \u2192 ccbb (plain brown)\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, using Punnett squares directly might help.\n\nAlternatively, considering each gene separately and then combining the results.\n\nFor the pigment gene (C/c):\n\n- CC (pigment) : probability (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n- Cc (pigment) : 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2\n- cc (pigment) : 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the color gene (B/b):\n\n- BB (color) : 1/4\n- Bb (color) : 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2\n- bb (color) : 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products.\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by both genes. We need to find the combination of pigment and color that leads to each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (CcBb)\n\nThis requires pigment (C) and color (B). So, the genotype is CcBb. The probability of this is:\n\nProbability of Cc (pigment) * Probability of Bb (color) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nSo, 1/4 chance of Checkered red.\n\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (Ccbb)\n\nThis requires pigment (C) and color (bb). So, genotype is Ccbb. Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nCheckered brown.\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (ccBb)\n\nThis requires color (bb) but not pigment (cc). So, genotype is ccBb. Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPlain red.\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nColor (bb) and no pigment (cc). Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPlain brown.\n\nWait, but the options given don't match exactly. The user provided options A through H, each with specific counts. Also, the initial setup mentions the F2 generation, which typically includes the genotypes and phenotypes after two rounds of crossing.\n\nHowever, in my calculation above, each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to reflect equal distribution. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me re-examine.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the combined probabilities multiply. However, the presence of both genes affects the phenotype, so the phenotypes may not be equally likely.\n\nWait, in reality, some genotypes might result in the same phenotype due to dominance or epistasis, but the question doesn't mention anything like that. It just says checkered red is CcBb, etc., implying that each genotype corresponds uniquely to a phenotype.\n\nAssuming no such complexities, each phenotype should have 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states 1,3,9,3. That's a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which suggests a tripling factor beyond simple Mendelian ratios. This usually comes from incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question doesn't indicate such.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the cross isn't between two F1s but between a F1 and a F2 or something else. Let me read again.\n\nNo, the problem states: \"a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, the parents are homozygous (checkered red is CC BB, plain brown is cc bb). They produce F1 which are CcBb. Then, the F1s are crossed to produce F2.\n\nIn that case, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nEach F1 bird produces four gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nCrossing F1 (CB, Cb, cB, cb) with F1 (same):\n\nAll combinations will be:\n\nCB x CB \u2192 CcBb\nCB x Cb \u2192 CcBb\nCB x cB \u2192 CcBb\nCB x cb \u2192 CcBb\nCb x CB \u2192 CcBb\nCb x Cb \u2192 CcBb\nCb x cB \u2192 CcBb\nCb x cb \u2192 CcBb\ncB x CB \u2192 CcBb\ncB x Cb \u2192 CcBb\ncB x cB \u2192 CcBb\ncB x cb \u2192 CcBb\ncb x CB \u2192 CcBb\ncb x Cb \u2192 CcBb\ncb x cB \u2192 CcBb\ncb x cb \u2192 CcBb\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. The actual F2 genotypes from F1 x F1 would include all possible combinations where each parent contributes one allele. Each F1 bird can produce four gametes, so when crossed, there are 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations. Out of these, the number of each genotype is:\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CcBb: All possible combinations except when both alleles are c or when one is c and the other is b. Wait, actually, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (all others)\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n\nWait, that can't be right. Actually, in a dihybrid cross, each gene segregates independently, so the F2 genotypes are all CcBb except when there's a change in dominance, but since all are codominant, it's uniform.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing things. Let me approach this differently. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, assuming independent assortment and no dominance interactions. But in this case, we have specific phenotypes defined by dominant alleles.\n\nWait, the key point is that the phenotypes depend on the combination of the two genes. So, for the F2, the phenotypic ratio would depend on how many genotypes fall into each phenotype category.\n\nGiven the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (CcBb)\n2. Checkered brown (Ccbb)\n3. Plain red (ccBb)\n4. Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nNow, the probability for each:\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n\n- C (Cc): 3/4\n- c (cc): 1/4\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n- B (Bb): 3/4\n- b (bb): 1/4\n\nCombined probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, that gives a ratio of 9:3:3:1, matching the typical F2 dihybrid ratio without considering phenotypic expressions. However, in the answer options provided, none seem to fit this ratio. Let me look again:\n\nOptions A-F:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6+2=8; 6+2=8 \u2192 8:8 \u2192 1:1\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 12:4 \u2192 3:1\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 matches our calculation\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1+3=4; 9+3=12 \u2192 4:12 \u2192 1:3\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16 total, but individual ratios aren't clear\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 equal distribution\n\nOur calculation gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is option C. But none of the options list C as correct, according to the user's message. Wait, let me check the user's question again.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAnd the options are labeled A to J, with option C being 9,3,3,1.\n\nYes, that's what we calculated. So, the correct answer should be option C, which states a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking back, the user listed options A-G as follows:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ.

So, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nHowever, looking back, the initial user message had the options starting with A, and the answer should correspond to option C, which lists 9,3,3,1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

One is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means its genotype must be CC BB since both genes are dominant. The other bird is a plain brown one, so its genotype would be cc bb because they're both recessive.\n\nThe goal is to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation after an adihybrid cross between these two parents. Wait, hold on\u2014adihybrid cross? That term seems a bit confusing. Usually, adihybrid refers to a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes a gamete with one of the two alleles. But here, the parents themselves are already homozygous. Hmm, maybe that's just a typo or misinterpretation. It might actually mean a regular dihybrid cross instead.\n\nSo, let me assume we're doing a standard dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. In such cases, the F1 generation will have all the possible combinations, and then the F2 will be from the F1. Since both parents are homozygous, their offspring should all be heterozygous for both traits. So, the F1 genotype would be CcBb.\n\nWait, but the question mentions F1 \u00d7 F1, which makes sense because F1 would produce gametes that are all CcBb. Then, when F1 flies with another F1, you get the F2 generation.\n\nNow, the next part is about phenotypic ratios based on the combination of two traits: color and pigmentation. The problem gives four categories: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Each has specific genotypes contributing to them.\n\nLet me outline the possible genotypes:\n\n- For the first trait (pigment): checkered (C) and plain (c)\n- For the second trait (color): red (B) and brown (b)\n\nSo, combining these, the genotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (CcBB)\n2. Checkered brown (Ccbb)\n3. Plain red (ccBB)\n4. Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nEach of these will express different phenotypes as per the dominance rules:\n- Pigment (C) is dominant over plain (c), so any presence of C results in pigment.\n- Color (B) is dominant over brown (b), so any presence of B results in red.\n\nSo, the phenotype hierarchy would be:\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. Plain red (ccB_)\n4. Plain brown (cccc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Actually, the order depends on how the traits work. Since pigment is dominant, any C means pigment regardless of color. Similarly, B makes it red. So, the phenotype can be expressed as:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B, it's checkered red.\n- If it has at least one C but not B, it's checkered brown.\n- If it has at least one c but not B, it's plain red.\n- Only if it's entirely c and b, it's plain brown.\n\nBut wait, the actual expression would depend on whether both traits are present. So, perhaps the correct way is to see if each trait is present.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dominance, the phenotype could be determined by the combination of C and B:\n\n- If both C and B are present (at least one C and at least one B), it's checkered red.\n- If only C is present (no B), it's checkered brown.\n- If only c is present (but not B?), no, wait, the presence of c doesn't affect B unless it's recessive. Wait, no\u2014the recessive allele is only present if the bird has two recessive alleles. So, for the color, B is dominant, so if the bird has at least one B, it'll be red; else, it'll be brown.\n\nSimilarly, for pigment, C is dominant, so if there's at least one C, it'll be pigmented; else, it won't be.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype can be broken down into four possibilities:\n\n1. At least one C and at least one B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. At least one C and no B \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. No C (so cc) and at least one B \u2192 Plain red\n4. No C and no B \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the presence of C affects pigment, and the presence of B affects color, but the combination is more complex. For example, a bird with C and B will have both pigments and color, making it checkered red. A bird with C but no B will have pigments but plain color, making it checkered brown. A bird with no C but B will have plain color but no pigments, so plain red. And finally, a bird with neither C nor B will have no color and no pigment, so plain brown.\n\nGiven that, now we need to determine how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nSince the parents are both CC BB and cc bb, all their F1 will be CcBb. Then, F1 selfing will give the F2 generation.\n\nTo calculate the F2 phenotypic ratios, I think we can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nThe parents are CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWhen crossing CC BB x cc bb, the F1 genotypes will be CcBb. However, when F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) is crossed, we need to consider all possible combinations.\n\nBut wait, the initial assumption was that it's a dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. Alternatively, sometimes \"dihybrid\" refers to having two different traits, like height and seedling. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking about a dihybrid cross between two plants differing in two traits.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would result from selfing F1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intended to say a dihybrid cross between two parents who are each heterozygous for two traits, resulting in F2 generation with various phenotypes based on the combination of those traits.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross where each parent is CcBb, the F1 will also be CcBb.\n\nThen, the F2 will come from F1 x F1.\n\nEach trait is independently assorting, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and combine them.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\nProbability of at least one C = 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nFor color (B):\n\nProbability of at least one B = 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 3/4\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probability for both traits (assuming additive effects) would be (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for checkered red (since both traits are expressed).\n\nSimilarly, for checkered brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor plain red: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nFor plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which checks out.\n\nSo, the expected phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n\nHowever, looking again, I think I made a mistake earlier because the colors are separate. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the F2 generation is derived from F1 x F1, where F1 is CcBb. When F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) is crossed, the possible gametes from each parent are CB, cb, cB, and cb.\n\nThus, the Punnett square would look like:\n\n        | C | c \n      -----------------\n      C     | CC | Cc \n      cB    | Cc | cc \n      c     | Cc | cc \n      bb    | Cc | bb \n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list all combinations correctly. Each parent produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- From each parent, 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb.\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- 25% CB x CB = CcBb\n- 25% CB x cb = CcBb\n- 25% CB x cB = CcBb\n- 25% CB x cb = CcBb\n- Similarly, all other combinations will yield CcBb except when both parents contribute cb, leading to ccbb.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Each F1 parent produces four gametes: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb.\n\nSo, when multiplying F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFrom CB x CB: CcBb\nFrom CB x cb: CcBb\nFrom CB x cB: CcBb\nFrom CB x cb: CcBb\nFrom cb x CB: CcBb\nFrom cb x cb: ccbb\nFrom cB x CB: CcBb\nFrom cB x cb: CcBb\nFrom cb x cB: CcBb\nFrom cb x cb: ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014this isn't accurate. Each parent contributes one allele, so for each gene, the possible gametes are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Parent 1: 50% C, 50% c\n\nFor color (B):\n- Parent 1: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Parent 1: 50% C, 50% c\n- Parent 2: same\n\nFor color (B):\n- Parent 1: 50% B, 50% b\n- Parent 2: same\n\nThus, the F2 genotype for pigment would be:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for color:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bc: 50%\n- cb: 25%\n\nBut when considering the combination, each gene is independent. So, the overall F2 phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, the chance of being checkered red is the product of being C and B:\n\nP(C) = 3/4, P(B) = 3/4 \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown is C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain red is not C and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain brown is not C and not B: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says:\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich matches our calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the 9:3:3:1 rule, which is commonly used in Mendelian genetics for dihybrids.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking about a dihybrid cross between two plants differing in two traits.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would result from selfing F1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intended to say a dihybrid cross between two parents who are each heterozygous for two traits, resulting in F2 generation with various phenotypes based on the combination of those traits.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross where each parent is CcBb, the F1 will also be CcBb.\n\nThen, the F2 will come from F1 x F1.\n\nEach trait is independently assorting, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and combine them.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\nProbability of at least one C = 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nFor color (B):\n\nProbability of at least one B = 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 3/4\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probability for both traits (assuming additive effects) would be (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for checkered red (since both traits are expressed).\n\nSimilarly, for checkered brown: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nFor plain red: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nFor plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which checks out.\n\nSo, the expected phenotypic ratios would be:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n\nHowever, looking again, I think I made a mistake earlier because the colors are separate. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the F2 generation is derived from F1 x F1, where F1 is CcBb. When F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) is crossed, the possible gametes from each parent are CB, cb, cB, and cb.\n\nThus, the Punnett square would look like:\n\n        | C | c \n      -----------------\n      C     | CC | Cc \n      cB    | Cc | cc \n      c     | Cc | cc \n      bb    | Cc | bb \n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to list all combinations correctly. Each parent produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nSo, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- From each parent, 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb.\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- 25% CB x CB = CcBb\n- 25% CB x cb = CcBb\n- 25% CB x cB = CcBb\n- 25% CB x cb = CcBb\n- Similarly, all other combinations will yield CcBb except when both parents contribute cb, leading to ccbb.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. Each F1 parent produces four gametes: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb.\n\nSo, when multiplying F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFrom CB x CB: CcBb\nFrom CB x cb: CcBb\nFrom CB x cB: CcBb\nFrom CB x cb: CcBb\nFrom cb x CB: CcBb\nFrom cb x cb: ccbb\nFrom cB x CB: CcBb\nFrom cB x cb: CcBb\nFrom cb x cB: CcBb\nFrom cb x cb: ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014this isn't accurate. Each parent contributes one allele, so for each gene, the possible gametes are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Parent 1: 50% C, 50% c\n\nFor color (B):\n- Parent 1: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Parent 1: 50% C, 50% c\n- Parent 2: same\n\nFor color (B):\n- Parent 1: 50% B, 50% b\n- Parent 2: same\n\nThus, the F2 genotype for pigment would be:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for color:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bc: 50%\n- cb: 25%\n\nBut when considering the combination, each gene is independent. So, the overall F2 phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFor example, the chance of being checkered red is the product of being C and B:\n\nP(C) = 3/4, P(B) = 3/4 \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown is C and not B: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain red is not C and B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain brown is not C and not B: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says:\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich matches our calculation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the 9:3:3:1 rule, which is commonly used in Mendelian genetics for dihybrids.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "rollout": " Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have two birds being crossed. One is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). I need to determine the phenotypic ratio in their F2 generation using Punnett squares.\n\nLet's start by understanding the genes involved. There are two genes here: one controlling the color (B for brown, b for red) and another controlling the pattern (C for checkered, c for plain). Both genes are linked but not affecting each other directly since they're on different chromosomes. However, since both parents are heterozygous for both genes, the F1 generation will be a mix of these combinations.\n\nThe first step is to set up the Punnett square for the cross between CC BB and cc bb. Since each parent is heterozygous for both genes, the gametes from each parent will be a combination of the alleles for each gene.\n\nFor the color gene (B and b):\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes CB or CB (since both are dominant).\nWait, no\u2014wait, actually, since both parents are homozygous for their respective traits, the gametes should just carry either the dominant or recessive allele. Wait, hold on\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So for the color gene:\n- Parent 1 (CC BB): Can only produce gametes with B (since both alleles are B, which is dominant).\n- Parent 2 (cc bb): Can only produce gametes with b (both alleles are b).\n\nSo all F1 offspring will get one B and one b from each parent, resulting in the genotype Cc Bb for each bird? Wait, that doesn't seem right because each bird would get one allele from each parent. So for the color gene, each bird gets either B or b, but since Parent 1 only gives B and Parent 2 gives b, every F1 bird must be Cc (for color) and Bb (for pattern). But wait, when you combine them, you end up with Cc Bb for each bird, meaning they're always heterozygous for both traits.\n\nBut let's think about the actual cross. Wait, maybe I got confused earlier. Let's correct that.\n\nEach bird is homozygous for both genes. So:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nThis bird has two C alleles (checkered) and two B alleles (brown). So any gamete produced will be CB or CB, but since both are same, it's just CB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb\nThis bird has two c alleles (plain) and two b alleles (red). So any gamete produced will be cb or cb, again just cb.\n\nTherefore, all F1 offspring will receive one CB and one cb allele from each parent, making their genotype CB cb for both genes. Wait, but when considering each gene separately, the F1 would be Cc and Bb. Because for each gene, the F1 is a combination of the alleles from each parent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me use the standard Punnett square setup for two parents: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n1. **Color Gene (B/b):**\n   - Parent 1: CC \u2192 can only give C.\n   - Parent 2: bb \u2192 can only give b.\n   - So F1 will have C and b, resulting in Cb.\n\n2. **Pattern Gene (C/c):**\n   - Parent 1: CC \u2192 can only give C.\n   - Parent 2: cc \u2192 can only give c.\n   - So F1 will have C and c, resulting in Cc.\n\nSince both genes are independent (assuming they don't affect each other), the F1 phenotype will be a combination of these two. But wait, in reality, some species might have linked genes, but the question states they're separate. So the F1 phenotype for each gene is as follows:\n\n- Color: C (which is brown) and b (which is red).\n- Pattern: C (checkered) and c (plain).\n\nThus, F1 individuals would be Cc Bb. Now, looking at their phenotypes:\n\n- Brown (from color gene Bb) and Checkered (from pattern Cc) \u2192 Brown Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, F1s would all be Brown Checkered because both parents are homozygous and their gametes result in Cb and Cc.\n\nNow, moving to the F2 generation. To do this, we'll look at the F1 parents (Cc Bb) and create another generation of crosses.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Each F1 bird is Cc Bb. So when we make an F2 generation, we'll cross F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nSo the possible gametes from F1 (Cc Bb) would be:\n\n- From Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- Cc x Cc: Genotype Cc x Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Bb x Bb: Genotype Bb x Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 phenotypes would depend on both genes. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n- For C (color): 25% CC (Brown), 50% Cc (Checkered), 25% cc (Red)\n- For B (pattern): 25% BB (Brown), 50% Bb (Checkered), 25% bb (Red)\n\nSo the F2 will have four possible combinations of colors and patterns:\n\n1. Brown (B) + Checkered (C) \u2192 Brown Checkered\n2. Brown (B) + Plain (c) \u2192 Brown Plain\n3. Red (b) + Checkered (C) \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Red (b) + Plain (c) \u2192 Red Plain\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the Punnett square:\n\nEach gene's segregation is independent, so we multiply the probabilities.\n\n- Brown Checkered (B_C): (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Brown Plain (B_c): (25% C) * (75% b) = 18.75%\n- Red Checkered (b_C): (75% c) * (25% C) = 18.75%\n- Red Plain (b_c): (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nAdding these percentages together gives 100%.\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts assuming a large number of offspring (e.g., 100 birds):\n\n- Brown Checkered: 6.25% of 100 = 6.25 \u2248 6 birds\n- Brown Plain: 18.75 \u2248 19 birds (but since total is 100, let's see exact numbers)\nWait, actually, the fractions add up correctly:\n\n6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%\n\nBut in terms of counts, if we assume 100 flies:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 6.25 \u2192 6\n- Brown Plain: 18.75 \u2192 19\n- Red Checkered: 18.75 \u2192 19\n- Red Plain: 56.25 \u2192 56\n\nBut the options given don't include decimals, so perhaps we consider the exact ratios without rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect in combining the phenotypes. Maybe I should instead look at the expected phenotypic ratios based on the possible combinations.\n\nAnother way to compute is to note that each bird has a 25% chance for each phenotype combination.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate because each gene's outcome is independent, so the combined probability isn't simply additive like that. Instead, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes, so we need to count the number of combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nLooking back, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown Checkered (B_B_): This occurs when the bird is brown and checkered. Looking at the F2 cross, this happens when both genes are present in the dominant form. Specifically, when the color is B and the pattern is C. From the Punnett square, this is achieved by the combination where the color is B and the pattern is C. In our case, since the F2 is made from F1 (Cc Bb) \u00d7 F1 (Cc Bb), the possible phenotypes are determined by the F2 cross.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it systematically.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird is a result of crossing F1 (Cc Bb) with F1 (Cc Bb). Therefore, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combinations of the two genes.\n\nPhenotype possibilities:\n\n- Brown Checkered (B_C)\n- Brown Plain (B_c)\n- Red Checkered (b_C)\n- Red Plain (b_c)\n\nNow, how many offspring fall into each category?\n\nFrom the Punnett square cross of Cc x Cc and Bb x Bb:\n\n- For color (B/C):\n  - BB: Brown (25%)\n  - Bb: Checkered (50%)\n  - bb: Red (25%)\n\n- For pattern (C/c):\n  - BB: Brown (25%)\n  - Bb: Checkered (50%)\n  - bb: Red (25%)\n\nTo find the combined phenotype, we need to look at all combinations where both traits are expressed. However, in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant trait. Since each bird has both traits, we need to ensure that for a phenotype to be expressed, the dominant allele must be present.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is B_B_, then it's brown. If it's b_bb_, then it's red. Similarly for pattern. But in reality, a bird could have both dominant traits, but in this case, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both genes. However, in this specific scenario, since each bird is homozygous for both genes (because F1 is Cc Bb), each bird is always heterozygous for both genes. Therefore, each bird will display both traits unless both are recessive, which is rare.\n\nBut looking back, the F2 cross is between Cc Bb and Cc Bb. So each bird is Cc Bb, meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown Checkered (B_B_)\n2. Brown Plain (B_b_)\n3. Red Checkered (b_B_)\n4. Red Plain (b_b_)\n\nNow, calculating the proportion:\n\n- For Brown Checkered (B_B_):\n  - Probability of B_B_: (25% B) * (25% C) = 6.25%\n- For Brown Plain (B_b_):\n  - Probability of B_b_: (25% B) * (75% c) = 18.75%\n- For Red Checkered (b_B_):\n  - Probability of b_B_: (75% c) * (25% C) = 18.75%\n- For Red Plain (b_b_):\n  - Probability of b_b_: (75% c) * (75% c) = 56.25%\n\nConverting these proportions to counts (assuming 100 flies):\n\n- Brown Checkered: 6.25\n- Brown Plain: 18.75\n- Red Checkered: 18.75\n- Red Plain: 56.25\n\nRounding these to whole numbers, we'd approximate:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 6\n- Brown Plain: 19\n- Red Checkered: 19\n- Red Plain: 56\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D says:\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that doesn't match my calculations. Option H says:\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the question specifies the checkered pattern is C and plain is c, and red is B and brown is b. So:\n\n- Checkered = dominant C (B_), plain = recessive c (bb)\n- Brown = dominant B (B_), red = recessive b (bb)\n\nWait, no, in the question, red is b, and brown is B. So:\n\n- If a bird has B, it's brown; if it has b, it's red.\n- If a bird has C, it's checkered; if it has c, it's plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird will express both traits unless both are recessive. However, in this case, each bird is heterozygous for both genes, so they will definitely display both traits. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits expressed, leading to four possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, the ratios were approximately 6:18:18:56, which simplifies to 6:18:18:56. But none of the answer choices exactly match this except perhaps option E, but E has 3:9:3:1, which seems more like a Mendelian dihybrid cross, but that's for a dihybrid cross rather than a test cross.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It asks for the F2 generation of a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 would be from CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Therefore, the F1 would be Cc Bb, as each parent contributes one allele.\n\nThen, the F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1, which is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the dominance of B and b.\n\nWait, but in this case, since both genes are independently assorting, the expected phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1. However, the question is about the F2 generation of a cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps the F2 refers to the F2 from the cross of F1 (Cc Bb) with itself.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. These are both homozygous, so the F1 is Cc Bb. Then, the F2 would be the next generation after F1 \u00d7 F1, which is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nUnder standard Mendelian assumptions, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. However, in this case, the genes may not be fully independent due to linkage, but the question doesn't specify anything about linkage. Assuming they are independent, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut the answer choices don't include such a ratio. They all involve comparing the checkered and plain colors against red and brown. So perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratios within the F2 generation for each trait separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio for each gene individually, ignoring the other gene.\n\nWait, looking back, the question is about the F2 generation from a cross of a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. That cross results in F1 (Cc Bb), and F2 would be from F1 \u00d7 F1, which is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nAssuming independence, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown Checkered: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Brown Plain: (25% C) * (75% b) = 18.75%\n- Red Checkered: (75% c) * (25% B) = 18.75%\n- Red Plain: (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nWhich adds up to 100%. Rounding to whole numbers, that would be approximately 6:19:19:56.\n\nBut the answer choices don't reflect this. Instead, they all focus on checking vs. plain vs. brown, and compare the ratios among themselves.\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This suggests equal distribution among the four phenotypes, which wouldn't be the case if both genes are segregating independently.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, unequal distribution.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Also uneven.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. This implies that no red or brown are present, which contradicts the fact that both genes contribute to color and pattern.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing these gives 9+3+3+1=16, which is less than 100. Not likely.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, summing to 16, which is too low.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, also too low.\n\nWait,",

One is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). I need to determine the phenotypic ratio in their F2 generation using Punnett squares.\n\nLet's start by understanding the genes involved.

So for the color gene:\n- Parent 1 (CC BB): Can only produce gametes with B (since both alleles are B, which is dominant).\n- Parent 2 (cc bb): Can only produce gametes with b (both alleles are b).\n\nSo all F1 offspring will get one B and one b from each parent, resulting in the genotype Cc Bb for each bird? Wait, that doesn't seem right because each bird would get one allele from each parent. So for the color gene, each bird gets either B or b, but since Parent 1 only gives B and Parent 2 gives b, every F1 bird must be Cc (for color) and Bb (for pattern). But wait, when you combine them, you end up with Cc Bb for each bird, meaning they're always heterozygous for both traits.\n\nBut let's think about the actual cross.

Now, looking at their phenotypes:\n\n- Brown (from color gene Bb) and Checkered (from pattern Cc) \u2192 Brown Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, F1s would all be Brown Checkered because both parents are homozygous and their gametes result in Cb and Cc.\n\nNow, moving to the F2 generation. To do this, we'll look at the F1 parents (Cc Bb) and create another generation of crosses.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Each F1 bird is Cc Bb. So when we make an F2 generation, we'll cross F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nSo the possible gametes from F1 (Cc Bb) would be:\n\n- From Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- Cc x Cc: Genotype Cc x Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Bb x Bb: Genotype Bb x Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 phenotypes would depend on both genes. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n- For C (color): 25% CC (Brown), 50% Cc (Checkered), 25% cc (Red)\n- For B (pattern): 25% BB (Brown), 50% Bb (Checkered), 25% bb (Red)\n\nSo the F2 will have four possible combinations of colors and patterns:\n\n1. Brown (B) + Checkered (C) \u2192 Brown Checkered\n2. Brown (B) + Plain (c) \u2192 Brown Plain\n3. Red (b) + Checkered (C) \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Red (b) + Plain (c) \u2192 Red Plain\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the Punnett square:\n\nEach gene's segregation is independent, so we multiply the probabilities.\n\n- Brown Checkered (B_C): (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Brown Plain (B_c): (25% C) * (75% b) = 18.75%\n- Red Checkered (b_C): (75% c) * (25% C) = 18.75%\n- Red Plain (b_c): (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nAdding these percentages together gives 100%.\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts assuming a large number of offspring (e.g., 100 birds):\n\n- Brown Checkered: 6.25% of 100 = 6.25 \u2248 6 birds\n- Brown Plain: 18.75 \u2248 19 birds (but since total is 100, let's see exact numbers)\nWait, actually, the fractions add up correctly:\n\n6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%\n\nBut in terms of counts, if we assume 100 flies:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 6.25 \u2192 6\n- Brown Plain: 18.75 \u2192 19\n- Red Checkered: 18.75 \u2192 19\n- Red Plain: 56.25 \u2192 56\n\nBut the options given don't include decimals, so perhaps we consider the exact ratios without rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect in combining the phenotypes. Maybe I should instead look at the expected phenotypic ratios based on the possible combinations.\n\nAnother way to compute is to note that each bird has a 25% chance for each phenotype combination.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate because each gene's outcome is independent, so the combined probability isn't simply additive like that. Instead, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes, so we need to count the number of combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nLooking back, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown Checkered (B_B_): This occurs when the bird is brown and checkered. Looking at the F2 cross, this happens when both genes are present in the dominant form. Specifically, when the color is B and the pattern is C. From the Punnett square, this is achieved by the combination where the color is B and the pattern is C. In our case, since the F2 is made from F1 (Cc Bb) \u00d7 F1 (Cc Bb), the possible phenotypes are determined by the F2 cross.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it systematically.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird is a result of crossing F1 (Cc Bb) with F1 (Cc Bb). Therefore, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combinations of the two genes.\n\nPhenotype possibilities:\n\n- Brown Checkered (B_C)\n- Brown Plain (B_c)\n- Red Checkered (b_C)\n- Red Plain (b_c)\n\nNow, how many offspring fall into each category?\n\nFrom the Punnett square cross of Cc x Cc and Bb x Bb:\n\n- For color (B/C):\n  - BB: Brown (25%)\n  - Bb: Checkered (50%)\n  - bb: Red (25%)\n\n- For pattern (C/c):\n  - BB: Brown (25%)\n  - Bb: Checkered (50%)\n  - bb: Red (25%)\n\nTo find the combined phenotype, we need to look at all combinations where both traits are expressed. However, in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant trait. Since each bird has both traits, we need to ensure that for a phenotype to be expressed, the dominant allele must be present.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is B_B_, then it's brown. If it's b_bb_, then it's red. Similarly for pattern. But in reality, a bird could have both dominant traits, but in this case, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both genes. However, in this specific scenario, since each bird is homozygous for both genes (because F1 is Cc Bb), each bird is always heterozygous for both genes. Therefore, each bird will display both traits unless both are recessive, which is rare.\n\nBut looking back, the F2 cross is between Cc Bb and Cc Bb. So each bird is Cc Bb, meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown Checkered (B_B_)\n2. Brown Plain (B_b_)\n3. Red Checkered (b_B_)\n4. Red Plain (b_b_)\n\nNow, calculating the proportion:\n\n- For Brown Checkered (B_B_):\n  - Probability of B_B_: (25% B) * (25% C) = 6.25%\n- For Brown Plain (B_b_):\n  - Probability of B_b_: (25% B) * (75% c) = 18.75%\n- For Red Checkered (b_B_):\n  - Probability of b_B_: (75% c) * (25% C) = 18.75%\n- For Red Plain (b_b_):\n  - Probability of b_b_: (75% c) * (75% c) = 56.25%\n\nConverting these proportions to counts (assuming 100 flies):\n\n- Brown Checkered: 6.25\n- Brown Plain: 18.75\n- Red Checkered: 18.75\n- Red Plain: 56.25\n\nRounding these to whole numbers, we'd approximate:\n\n- Brown Checkered: 6\n- Brown Plain: 19\n- Red Checkered: 19\n- Red Plain: 56\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D says:\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that doesn't match my calculations. Option H says:\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the question specifies the checkered pattern is C and plain is c, and red is B and brown is b. So:\n\n- Checkered = dominant C (B_), plain = recessive c (bb)\n- Brown = dominant B (B_), red = recessive b (bb)\n\nWait, no, in the question, red is b, and brown is B. So:\n\n- If a bird has B, it's brown; if it has b, it's red.\n- If a bird has C, it's checkered; if it has c, it's plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird will express both traits unless both are recessive. However, in this case, each bird is heterozygous for both genes, so they will definitely display both traits. Therefore, all F2 individuals will have both traits expressed, leading to four possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, the ratios were approximately 6:18:18:56, which simplifies to 6:18:18:56. But none of the answer choices exactly match this except perhaps option E, but E has 3:9:3:1, which seems more like a Mendelian dihybrid cross, but that's for a dihybrid cross rather than a test cross.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It asks for the F2 generation of a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 would be from CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Therefore, the F1 would be Cc Bb, as each parent contributes one allele.\n\nThen, the F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1, which is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the dominance of B and b.\n\nWait, but in this case, since both genes are independently assorting, the expected phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1. However, the question is about the F2 generation of a cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So perhaps the F2 refers to the F2 from the cross of F1 (Cc Bb) with itself.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The cross is CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. These are both homozygous, so the F1 is Cc Bb. Then, the F2 would be the next generation after F1 \u00d7 F1, which is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nUnder standard Mendelian assumptions, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. However, in this case, the genes may not be fully independent due to linkage, but the question doesn't specify anything about linkage. Assuming they are independent, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut the answer choices don't include such a ratio. They all involve comparing the checkered and plain colors against red and brown. So perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratios within the F2 generation for each trait separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio for each gene individually, ignoring the other gene.\n\nWait, looking back, the question is about the F2 generation from a cross of a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. That cross results in F1 (Cc Bb), and F2 would be from F1 \u00d7 F1, which is Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nAssuming independence, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown Checkered: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- Brown Plain: (25% C) * (75% b) = 18.75%\n- Red Checkered: (75% c) * (25% B) = 18.75%\n- Red Plain: (75% c) * (75% b) = 56.25%\n\nWhich adds up to 100%. Rounding to whole numbers, that would be approximately 6:19:19:56.\n\nBut the answer choices don't reflect this. Instead, they all focus on checking vs. plain vs. brown, and compare the ratios among themselves.\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This suggests equal distribution among the four phenotypes, which wouldn't be the case if both genes are segregating independently.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, unequal distribution.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Also uneven.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. This implies that no red or brown are present, which contradicts the fact that both genes contribute to color and pattern.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing these gives 9+3+3+1=16, which is less than 100. Not likely.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, summing to 16, which is too low.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, also too low.\n\nWait,",

    "rollout": " It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and the other plain brown. The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- The dominant genes are C and B.\n- The recessive alleles are c and b.\n- Checkered patterns are controlled by the dominant gene C, meaning if there's at least one C, it will be checkered.\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c, so if both genes are c, it'll be plain.\n- Red color is governed by the dominant gene B, so if at least one B, it'll be red. If both are b, it'll be brown.\n  \nThe parents involved are:\n- One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird. Since checkered is dominant over plain, this means they have at least one C. But since it's checkered, maybe it's homozygous? Wait, but in some cases, checkered could mean any dominant trait. However, since they're explicitly stated as checkered red, perhaps their genotype is CC (assuming no c), because if they were Cc, they would still be checkered, just not necessarily all checkered. But usually, a homozygous bird would have both alleles the same. So I think their genotype is CC for C and cc for c. Wait, but red is B, which is dominant. So a red bird must have at least one B. So if it's checkered red, maybe it has at least one C and at least one B. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, actually, the first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird. So 'checkered' refers to the dominant trait, and 'red' refers to another dominant trait. So perhaps their genotype is BBCC or something else. No, wait, maybe it's CC for the dominant trait (since checkered is dominant). But the specific traits are determined by multiple loci, right? So each bird has two loci: one for C (dominant = checkered) and one for B (dominant = red).\n\nSo a homozygous checkered red bird would likely have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. But how exactly? Maybe their genotype is CcCc or something like that? Or perhaps they're CC for C and BB for B, making them BBCC? That seems too much. Alternatively, since they're checkered, their C locus might be dominant, and since they're red, their B locus is also dominant. So their genotype could be Cc (for C) and Bb (for B), making it CcBb. Because if you're heterozygous for both dominant traits, your phenotype would be checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, the other parent is a plain brown bird. Plain is recessive (so both alleles are c), and brown is dominant (so at least one B). So their genotype must be ccBB. Because if they were ccbb, that would make them checkered, but they're plain. So their genotype is ccBB.\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, what will be the gametes?\n\nFor the first parent (CcBb):\n\nThey can produce four types of gametes based on independent assortment:\n- C (for C)\n- c (for c)\n- B (for B)\n- b (for b)\n\nBut considering dominance, the actual phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. However, since we're looking for gamete types, regardless of dominance, the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nFor the second parent (ccBB):\n\nThey can only produce gametes:\n- C (from BB) and b (from bb). So the gametes are CB and cb.\n\nWhen these two parents (CcBb \u00d7 ccBB) mate, the F1 generation would consist of all combinations of the gametes from each parent.\n\nSo the F1 genotypes would be:\n- From C gamete (either C or c):\n   - First parent contributes C or c.\n   - Second parent contributes C or c.\n   So possible Cc and cc.\n\nFrom B gamete (either B or b):\n   - First parent contributes B or b.\n   - Second parent doesn't contribute B or b (because the second parent is ccBB, so only B and b come from the B locus).\n   So possible BB, Bb, bB, bb.\n\nThus, the F1 would be CcBb \u00d7 ccBB, leading to F1 genotypes like CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, etc.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about an F2 generation after crossing a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So that's the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nLet me correct my approach.\n\nThe F1 will be all the possible combinations where each parent contributes either C or c from the first locus and B or b from the second locus.\n\nWait, no. The first parent is CcBb and the second is ccBB.\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n- Parent 1: CB, Cb, cB, cb\n- Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nSo when crossed, the F1 will have gametes from each parent combined.\n\nThe F1 will have:\n- From Parent 1: CB, Cb, cB, cb\n- From Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nThus, F1 genotypes will be:\n- CcBb + CB \u2192 CcBB\n- CcBb + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cBbB + CB \u2192 ccBB (wait, no, correction: the second parent is ccBB, so their gametes are CB and cb. So when combining with Parent 1's gametes, the F1 genotypes are:\n   - CcBb (from Parent1's CB and Parent2's CB)\n   - CcBb (from Parent1's CB and Parent2's cb)\n   - cBbB (from Parent1's cB and Parent2's CB)\n   - cBbB (from Parent1's cB and Parent2's cb)\n   - ccBB (from Parent1's cb and Parent2's CB)\n   - ccBB (from Parent1's cb and Parent2's cb)\n\nWait, no. Let me list them properly:\n\nParent1 gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb\nParent2 gametes: CB, cb\n\nSo when combining:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- Cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB\n- Cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 ccBB\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 ccBB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are:\n- CcBB (from CB+CB)\n- CcBb (from CB+cb)\n- CcBB (from Cb+CB)\n- CcBb (from Cb+cb)\n- ccBB (from cB+CB)\n- ccBB (from cB+cb)\n- ccBB (from cb+CB)\n- ccBB (from cb+cb)\n\nSimplifying, F1 genotypes:\n- CcBB: occurs twice \u2192 frequency 2/8 = 1/4\n- CcBb: occurs twice \u2192 frequency 2/8 = 1/4\n- ccBB: occurs four times \u2192 frequency 4/8 = 1/2\n\nWait, but the question is about F2, so we need to go from F1 to F2.\n\nSo F1 is CcBB, CcBb, and ccBB. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nLet's consider each F1 genotype:\n\n1. CcBB:\n   - When crossed with itself (CcBB \u00d7 CcBB), the offspring will inherit C from both parents, so their C locus will be dominant (checkered), and B from both parents, so their B locus will be dominant (red).\n   - Genotype: CcBB \u00d7 CcBB \u2192 all offspring will have CC (from both Cs), but wait, no: each parent contributes one C and one B. Wait, no, the F1 is CcBB, so each parent contributes either Cc or BB.\n\nWait, correction: F1 is CcBB \u00d7 CcBB. Each parent's gametes are Cc and BB. So F2 will have:\n\n- For C locus: possible gametes Cc (from Cc) or BB (from BB). But since F1 is CcBB, each parent contributes Cc or BB. So in F2, the C locus will be inherited as follows:\n   - 50% Cc (from Cc gamete)\n   - 50% BB (from BB gamete)\n   But wait, each parent can only give one gamete. So the F2 will have Cc from one parent and BB from the other, resulting in CcBB for each F2 individual. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nNo, F1 is CcBB. So each parent can contribute Cc or BB. So the F2 will receive one allele from each parent.\n\nIf a parent contributes Cc, then the F2 will get C and c from that parent, plus BB from the other parent, giving CcBB.\n\nIf a parent contributes BB, then the F2 will get B from that parent, so overall genotype becomes BB followed by whatever from the other parent.\n\nWait, no. Wait, F1 is CcBB, so each parent gives either Cc or BB. So F2 will get one from each parent.\n\nSo F2 genotype possibilities:\n- From Cc (parent1) and BB (parent2): CcBB\n- From BB (parent1) and Cc (parent2): BB Cc \u2192 but since order doesn't matter, it's BB Cc, which simplifies to BBc (but that's not possible; each F2 should have both alleles from each parent. Wait, no, each F2 gets one allele from each parent, so if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 genotype is CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 genotype is BB Cc, but that's impossible because you can't have a double allele without considering both. Wait, no: each F2 receives one allele from each parent. So if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 will have C from parent1 and B from parent2, making it CcBB. If parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 will have B from parent2 and c from parent2, making it BBc? Wait, no, because each parent contributes one allele. So the F2 will always have one from each parent, so it's either Cc (from parent1) and BB (from parent2), or BB (from parent1) and Cc (from parent2). In both cases, the F2 genotype is CcBB. Wait, that can't be right because if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 will have C from parent1 and B from parent2, resulting in CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 will have B from parent2 and c from parent2, resulting in BBc, but that's not correct because each F2 must have two alleles. Wait, no, each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 will have C (from parent1) and B (from parent2), making it CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 will have B (from parent2) and c (from parent2), making it BBc? No, that's not possible because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's C (from parent1) and B (from parent2), making CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 will have C from parent1 and C from parent2, making CC, and B from parent1 and B from parent2, making BB. So the F2 will have CCBB or similar.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach F2 individual receives one allele from each parent. So if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 genotype is C (from parent1) and B (from parent2), resulting in CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 genotype is B (from parent2) and c (from parent2), making BBc? No, that's incorrect because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's B (from parent2) and c (from parent2), making BBc? Wait, that's impossible because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's B from parent2 and c from parent2, making BBc? No, that's not possible because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's B (from parent2) and c (from parent2), making Bc? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, each F2 must have one allele from each parent, so it's either C from parent1 and B from parent2 (CcBB), or B from parent1 and c from parent2 (BBc?), which isn't possible because each F2 must have two alleles. Wait, no, each F2 must have two alleles, so it's C from parent1 and B from parent2 (CCBB), or C from parent1 and c from parent2 (CCc?), which is impossible because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So the F2 genotype will be CcBB or BBc? No, that's not possible. Wait, no, each F2 must have two alleles, so it's C (from parent1) and B (from parent2), making CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 genotype is CC (from parent1) and CC (from parent2), making CC CC, which is technically possible. Wait, no, each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's C (from parent1) and C (from parent2), making CC, and B (from parent1) and B (from parent2), making BB. So the F2 genotype is CC BB.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the F1 and F2, maybe I should look up the Punnett square for dihybrid crosses when dealing with multiple genes and dominance relationships.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of phenotypic ratios based on the expected Mendelian ratios for each trait and combine them.\n\nSince the traits are determined independently (as per Mendel's law), the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nHowever, since the traits are determined by separate loci, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each trait.\n\nSo, for the C locus (dominant = checkered, recessive = plain):\n- Probability of checkered = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of plain = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (dominant = red, recessive = brown):\n- Probability of red = 3/4\n- Probability of brown = 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability for each combination is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, for example, the probability of being checkered (C) AND red (B) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Checkered AND brown = 9/16\n- Plain AND red = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Plain AND brown = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nBut wait, the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, which includes all possible combinations. However, the options provided don't seem to include all four combinations. They only provide four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, the phenotypic categories are based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, the four phenotypes would correspond to:\n1. Checkered and red (both dominant)\n2. Checkered and brown (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and red (C absent, B present)\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and the other plain brown. The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- The dominant genes are C and B.\n- The recessive alleles are c and b.\n- Checkered patterns are controlled by the dominant gene C, meaning if there's at least one C, it will be checkered.\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c, so if both genes are c, it'll be plain.\n- Red color is governed by the dominant gene B, so if at least one B, it'll be red. If both are b, it'll be brown.\n  \nThe parents involved are:\n- One parent is a homozygous checkered red bird. Since checkered is dominant over plain, this means they have at least one C. But since it's checkered, maybe it's homozygous? Wait, but in some cases, checkered could mean any dominant trait. However, since they're explicitly stated as checkered red, perhaps their genotype is CC (assuming no c), because if they were Cc, they would still be checkered, just not necessarily all checkered. But usually, a homozygous bird would have both alleles the same. So I think their genotype is CC for C and cc for c. Wait, but red is B, which is dominant. So a red bird must have at least one B. So if it's checkered red, maybe it has at least one C and at least one B. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, actually, the first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird. So 'checkered' refers to the dominant trait, and 'red' refers to another dominant trait. So perhaps their genotype is BBCC or something else. No, wait, maybe it's CC for the dominant trait (since checkered is dominant). But the specific traits are determined by multiple loci, right? So each bird has two loci: one for C (dominant = checkered) and one for B (dominant = red).\n\nSo a homozygous checkered red bird would likely have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. But how exactly? Maybe their genotype is CcCc or something like that? Or perhaps they're CC for C and BB for B, making them BBCC? That seems too much. Alternatively, since they're checkered, their C locus might be dominant, and since they're red, their B locus is also dominant. So their genotype could be Cc (for C) and Bb (for B), making it CcBb. Because if you're heterozygous for both dominant traits, your phenotype would be checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, the other parent is a plain brown bird. Plain is recessive (so both alleles are c), and brown is dominant (so at least one B). So their genotype must be ccBB. Because if they were ccbb, that would make them checkered, but they're plain. So their genotype is ccBB.\n\nNow, when these two parents mate, what will be the gametes?\n\nFor the first parent (CcBb):\n\nThey can produce four types of gametes based on independent assortment:\n- C (for C)\n- c (for c)\n- B (for B)\n- b (for b)\n\nBut considering dominance, the actual phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. However, since we're looking for gamete types, regardless of dominance, the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nFor the second parent (ccBB):\n\nThey can only produce gametes:\n- C (from BB) and b (from bb). So the gametes are CB and cb.\n\nWhen these two parents (CcBb \u00d7 ccBB) mate, the F1 generation would consist of all combinations of the gametes from each parent.\n\nSo the F1 genotypes would be:\n- From C gamete (either C or c):\n   - First parent contributes C or c.\n   - Second parent contributes C or c.\n   So possible Cc and cc.\n\nFrom B gamete (either B or b):\n   - First parent contributes B or b.\n   - Second parent doesn't contribute B or b (because the second parent is ccBB, so only B and b come from the B locus).\n   So possible BB, Bb, bB, bb.\n\nThus, the F1 would be CcBb \u00d7 ccBB, leading to F1 genotypes like CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, etc.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about an F2 generation after crossing a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So that's the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nLet me correct my approach.\n\nThe F1 will be all the possible combinations where each parent contributes either C or c from the first locus and B or b from the second locus.\n\nWait, no. The first parent is CcBb and the second is ccBB.\n\nEach parent produces four types of gametes:\n- Parent 1: CB, Cb, cB, cb\n- Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nSo when crossed, the F1 will have gametes from each parent combined.\n\nThe F1 will have:\n- From Parent 1: CB, Cb, cB, cb\n- From Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nThus, F1 genotypes will be:\n- CcBb + CB \u2192 CcBB\n- CcBb + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cBbB + CB \u2192 ccBB (wait, no, correction: the second parent is ccBB, so their gametes are CB and cb. So when combining with Parent 1's gametes, the F1 genotypes are:\n   - CcBb (from Parent1's CB and Parent2's CB)\n   - CcBb (from Parent1's CB and Parent2's cb)\n   - cBbB (from Parent1's cB and Parent2's CB)\n   - cBbB (from Parent1's cB and Parent2's cb)\n   - ccBB (from Parent1's cb and Parent2's CB)\n   - ccBB (from Parent1's cb and Parent2's cb)\n\nWait, no. Let me list them properly:\n\nParent1 gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb\nParent2 gametes: CB, cb\n\nSo when combining:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- Cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB\n- Cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 ccBB\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 ccBB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB\n\nSo the F1 genotypes are:\n- CcBB (from CB+CB)\n- CcBb (from CB+cb)\n- CcBB (from Cb+CB)\n- CcBb (from Cb+cb)\n- ccBB (from cB+CB)\n- ccBB (from cB+cb)\n- ccBB (from cb+CB)\n- ccBB (from cb+cb)\n\nSimplifying, F1 genotypes:\n- CcBB: occurs twice \u2192 frequency 2/8 = 1/4\n- CcBb: occurs twice \u2192 frequency 2/8 = 1/4\n- ccBB: occurs four times \u2192 frequency 4/8 = 1/2\n\nWait, but the question is about F2, so we need to go from F1 to F2.\n\nSo F1 is CcBB, CcBb, and ccBB. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nLet's consider each F1 genotype:\n\n1. CcBB:\n   - When crossed with itself (CcBB \u00d7 CcBB), the offspring will inherit C from both parents, so their C locus will be dominant (checkered), and B from both parents, so their B locus will be dominant (red).\n   - Genotype: CcBB \u00d7 CcBB \u2192 all offspring will have CC (from both Cs), but wait, no: each parent contributes one C and one B. Wait, no, the F1 is CcBB, so each parent contributes either Cc or BB.\n\nWait, correction: F1 is CcBB \u00d7 CcBB. Each parent's gametes are Cc and BB. So F2 will have:\n\n- For C locus: possible gametes Cc (from Cc) or BB (from BB). But since F1 is CcBB, each parent contributes Cc or BB. So in F2, the C locus will be inherited as follows:\n   - 50% Cc (from Cc gamete)\n   - 50% BB (from BB gamete)\n   But wait, each parent can only give one gamete. So the F2 will have Cc from one parent and BB from the other, resulting in CcBB for each F2 individual. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nNo, F1 is CcBB. So each parent can contribute Cc or BB. So the F2 will receive one allele from each parent.\n\nIf a parent contributes Cc, then the F2 will get C and c from that parent, plus BB from the other parent, giving CcBB.\n\nIf a parent contributes BB, then the F2 will get B from that parent, so overall genotype becomes BB followed by whatever from the other parent.\n\nWait, no. Wait, F1 is CcBB, so each parent gives either Cc or BB. So F2 will get one from each parent.\n\nSo F2 genotype possibilities:\n- From Cc (parent1) and BB (parent2): CcBB\n- From BB (parent1) and Cc (parent2): BB Cc \u2192 but since order doesn't matter, it's BB Cc, which simplifies to BBc (but that's not possible; each F2 should have both alleles from each parent. Wait, no, each F2 gets one allele from each parent, so if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 genotype is CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 genotype is BB Cc, but that's impossible because you can't have a double allele without considering both. Wait, no: each F2 receives one allele from each parent. So if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 will have C from parent1 and B from parent2, making it CcBB. If parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 will have B from parent2 and c from parent2, making it BBc? Wait, no, because each parent contributes one allele. So the F2 will always have one from each parent, so it's either Cc (from parent1) and BB (from parent2), or BB (from parent1) and Cc (from parent2). In both cases, the F2 genotype is CcBB. Wait, that can't be right because if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 will have C from parent1 and B from parent2, resulting in CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 will have B from parent2 and c from parent2, resulting in BBc, but that's not correct because each F2 must have two alleles. Wait, no, each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 will have C (from parent1) and B (from parent2), making it CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 will have B (from parent2) and c (from parent2), making it BBc? No, that's not possible because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's C (from parent1) and B (from parent2), making CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 will have C from parent1 and C from parent2, making CC, and B from parent1 and B from parent2, making BB. So the F2 will have CCBB or similar.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach F2 individual receives one allele from each parent. So if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives BB, the F2 genotype is C (from parent1) and B (from parent2), resulting in CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives BB and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 genotype is B (from parent2) and c (from parent2), making BBc? No, that's incorrect because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's B (from parent2) and c (from parent2), making BBc? Wait, that's impossible because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's B from parent2 and c from parent2, making BBc? No, that's not possible because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's B (from parent2) and c (from parent2), making Bc? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, each F2 must have one allele from each parent, so it's either C from parent1 and B from parent2 (CcBB), or B from parent1 and c from parent2 (BBc?), which isn't possible because each F2 must have two alleles. Wait, no, each F2 must have two alleles, so it's C from parent1 and B from parent2 (CCBB), or C from parent1 and c from parent2 (CCc?), which is impossible because each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So the F2 genotype will be CcBB or BBc? No, that's not possible. Wait, no, each F2 must have two alleles, so it's C (from parent1) and B (from parent2), making CcBB. Similarly, if parent1 gives Cc and parent2 gives Cc, the F2 genotype is CC (from parent1) and CC (from parent2), making CC CC, which is technically possible. Wait, no, each F2 must have two alleles, one from each parent. So it's C (from parent1) and C (from parent2), making CC, and B (from parent1) and B (from parent2), making BB. So the F2 genotype is CC BB.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the F1 and F2, maybe I should look up the Punnett square for dihybrid crosses when dealing with multiple genes and dominance relationships.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of phenotypic ratios based on the expected Mendelian ratios for each trait and combine them.\n\nSince the traits are determined independently (as per Mendel's law), the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nHowever, since the traits are determined by separate loci, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each trait.\n\nSo, for the C locus (dominant = checkered, recessive = plain):\n- Probability of checkered = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of plain = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (dominant = red, recessive = brown):\n- Probability of red = 3/4\n- Probability of brown = 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability for each combination is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, for example, the probability of being checkered (C) AND red (B) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Checkered AND brown = 9/16\n- Plain AND red = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Plain AND brown = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nBut wait, the question is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, which includes all possible combinations. However, the options provided don't seem to include all four combinations. They only provide four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, the phenotypic categories are based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles for each trait. So, the four phenotypes would correspond to:\n1. Checkered and red (both dominant)\n2. Checkered and brown (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and red (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and brown (both absent)\n\nWhich matches the options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.\n\nSo now, calculating the expected phenotypic ratio based on independent assortment:\n\n- Checkered and red: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered and brown: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and red: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and brown: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, which makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this adds up to 16 parts\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 No\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and another that's plain brown. The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down what's given. The parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So, each bird has two alleles for both genes. Let me write them out:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nSince they're dihybrids, we'll need to look at each trait separately and then combine the results. But wait, since the parents have different genotypes, their offspring will be a mix based on Mendel's laws.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the F1 generation from the cross. But wait, the user already provided the F1 gametes as CB, cb, cB, and cb. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the F2 now.\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb because each parent gives half of their chromosomes. Now, when we do a self-pollination (which makes up the F2), each bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. \n\nSo, the F2 generation will have these gametes combining in all possible ways. That means there will be 16 possible combinations, but some will result in the same genotype. For example, CB and cb can pair with each other, leading to CcBB, CcBb, etc., while CB paired with CB gives CcBB again? Wait, no, actually, each combination leads to a unique genotype if considering all possible pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible F2 genotypes. Since each parent contributes four types of gametes, the Punnett square would indeed have 16 possibilities. However, some will lead to the same genotype. For instance, pairing CB with CB gives CcBB, CB with cb gives CcBb, CB with cB gives CcBB again, and CB with cb gives CcBb again. Similarly, cb with cb gives ccbb, which is the F2 individual. So, after accounting for duplicates, the number might not reduce, but perhaps some genotypes are more common.\n\nBut maybe instead of counting all 16, I should calculate the actual counts for each genotype. Alternatively, perhaps using probability would be easier. Let me think about that.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so I can calculate the probabilities for each trait first and then combine them.\n\nFor the first gene (gene B for color):\n- Parent 1: CC (homozygous dominant)\n- Parent 2: cc (homozygous recessive)\nCrossing them: All F1 will be Cc.\nIn F2:\n- Probability of CC = 25% (from Punnett square: Cc x Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Probability of cc = 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (gene b for color):\n- Parent 1: BB (homozygous dominant)\n- Parent 2: bb (homozygous recessive)\nCrossing them: All F1 will be Bb.\nIn F2:\n- Probability of BB = 25%\n- Probability of Bb = 50%\n- Probability of bb = 25%\n\nNow, assuming independence between the two genes, the combined probabilities for each trait combination would multiply. So, for example, the probability of having checkered (CC) and red (BB) would be 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Checkered red: CC BB = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: CC bb = 6.25%\n- Plain red: cc BB = 6.25%\n- Plain brown: cc bb = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that seems off because adding all four would give 25%, but the options suggest larger numbers. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes translate into counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each gene is controlled separately and their independent assortment leads to specific phenotypic ratios. But the question mentions checking the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, the options provided seem to have higher numbers like 6, 2, 4, etc. So, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has its own segregation ratio. For a monohybrid cross (two alleles), the typical ratio is 3:1. But here, we're dealing with a dihybrid cross, so the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, but scaled depending on dominance.\n\nWait, but the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, the F1 would be CcBB (since each parent contributes C and B respectively?), no, wait. Let me correct that. Each parent contributes one allele each. So, the F1 would get one allele from each parent. Parent 1 is CC BB, so C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so c and b. So, each F1 gets C or c and B or b. Therefore, the F1 genotypes would be CcBB, CcBb, CccB, and Cccb. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each parent contributes one allele, so the F1 would be Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene. So, F1 genotypes are CcBb, which is the heterozygote for both traits.\n\nThen, when selfing (or in this case, creating the F2), the F2 would have various combinations. So, let's think about the F2:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the first gene (color B):\n\nParent 1: CC\nParent 2: cc\nSo, F1 (and F2) will have a 1:1 ratio for the alleles. Thus, F2 for gene B will be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (color b):\n\nParent 1: BB\nParent 2: bb\nSo, F2 will have 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities for each trait combination are multiplied. So:\n\n- Both traits dominant (checkered red): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- First dominant, second recessive (checkered brown): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- First recessive, second dominant (plain red): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Both recessive (plain brown): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nBut the options don't have fractions; they have whole numbers. So perhaps we're looking at the phenotypic ratios without scaling to percentages, meaning each possible phenotype occurs according to the proportion of their genetic contributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented as ratios of counts rather than percentages.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 (if summing all)\n\nL. 1, 2, 6, 3 (if considering dominance)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct way is to realize that each gene segregates independently, so the phenotypic ratio combines the ratios of each gene.\n\nThe phenotypes depend on whether an animal is dominant or recessive for each gene. So, for each trait, the dominant phenotype will take the majority.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation should have 9 possible phenotypes, but due to dominance, some may combine into fewer categories.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio among the checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nFrom our earlier analysis, the F2 should have four possible phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes being dominant or recessive.\n\nSo, let's calculate the proportions:\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- Dominant (red): 75% (25% CC + 50% Cc)\n- Recessive (brown): 25% (25% cc)\n\nFor Gene b (color):\n- Dominant (red): 75% (25% BB + 50% Bb)\n- Recessive (brown): 25% (25% bb)\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\nDominant B and dominant b: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (75%)\nDominant B and recessive b: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\nRecessive B and dominant b: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\nRecessive B and recessive b: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypic ratios:\n\nCheckered Red: 75% (1.5 parts if total is 3, but let's scale appropriately)\nCheckered Brown: 18.75% (0.3 parts)\nPlain Red: 18.75% (0.3 parts)\nPlain Brown: 6.25% (0.1 part)\n\nBut to express this as a ratio, we can multiply each percentage by 16 to eliminate decimals. 75%*16=12, 18.75%*16=3, 18.75%*16=3, 6.25%*16=1. So the ratio becomes 12:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option K says \"12, 2, 2, 0\", which isn't matching. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which also sums to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2014doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dominance. If \"dominant\" is represented by the presence of at least one dominant allele, then the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Dominant B and Dominant b: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 9/16\n- Dominant B and Recessive b: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 3/16\n- Recessive B and Dominant b: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 3/16\n- Recessive B and Recessive b: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown.\n\nBut none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1 except option K and option G. Option K is 12,2,2,0\u2014which doesn't fit. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which also doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance refers to the actual pigmentation, where only certain alleles produce visible colors. So, maybe the presence of dominant alleles leads to a certain phenotype, and recessive ones are the opposite.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nFor color B:\n- Dominant (Red): 75%\n- Recessive (Brown): 25%\n\nFor color b:\n- Dominant (Red): 75%\n- Recessive (Brown): 25%\n\nAssuming these are independent, the phenotypic ratio is still 9:3:3:1, but expressed differently.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the reverse of what we have. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which adds to 16 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but expressed as 12:3:3:1 if considering the sum correctly. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, so when combined, it's 9:3:3:1. This would correspond to checkered red (9 parts), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1).\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption K: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but 12+2+2+0=16.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Same as K.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16, but reversed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but likely the intended answer is option G, which is 12,2,2,0, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance.\n\nWait, another thought: If \"dominant\" in the context of pigmentation means that the presence of any dominant allele leads to a particular color. Suppose that for color B, BB and Bb produce red, and bb produces brown. For color b, BB and Bb produce brown, and bb produces red.\n\nBut that complicates things because now both traits are influenced by the same alleles.\n\nThis would mean that the F2 phenotypes depend on whether each trait is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo, for each bird, the color B and color b could be either dominant or recessive, independent of each other.\n\nSo, the possible combinations would be:\n\n- B dominant and b dominant \u2192 red (both)\n- B dominant and b recessive \u2192 red\n- B recessive and b dominant \u2192 red\n- B recessive and b recessive \u2192 brown\n\nSame logic applies to color b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both dominant: red\n2. One dominant, one recessive: red\n3. Both recessive: brown\n\nSo, regardless of which gene is dominant, as long as both are recessive, it's brown. Otherwise, it's red.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 12:3:3:0 if considering all possible combinations.\n\nWait, but this depends on the exact dominance rules. If both traits are required to be recessive for brown, otherwise red, then:\n\nNumber of reds: All except those with both traits recessive.\n\nThere are 16 possible genotypes in F2.\n\nNumber of green (brown) birds: Only the one where both color B and color b are recessive: 1 bird.\n\nSo, red:15, brown:1 \u2192 Ratio 15:1, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, if each trait is independent:\n\n- Both dominant: red\n- One dominant, one recessive: red\n- Both recessive: brown\n\nSo, the number of red birds: (number of B dominant * number of b dominant) + (number of B dominant * number of b recessive) + (number of B recessive * number of b dominant) ) + (number of B recessive * number of b recessive )\n\nWhich is:\n\n(2 * 2) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 reds, 3 browns \u2192 13:3.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of each phenotype.\n\nEach gene has 4 possible outcomes (2^2), so F2 has 16.\n\nNumber of checkered red: Genotypes where B is dominant and b is recessive.\n\nWait, no. Checkered red implies that color B is dominant and color b is recessive.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown is B recessive and b dominant.\n\nPlain red is B recessive and b recessive.\n\nPlain brown is B dominant and b dominant.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: B dominant, b recessive \u2192 2 * 2 = 4\n- Checkered brown: B recessive, b dominant \u2192 2 * 2 = 4\n- Plain red: B recessive, b recessive \u2192 1\n- Plain brown: B dominant, b dominant \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nWait, but 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 1 plain brown. Sum to 10, but that doesn't add up to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm double-counting.\n\nNo, each bird has only one genotype, so:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 1\nSum: 10, which is less than 16. Where are the remaining 6?\n\nAh, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is:\n\n- B dominant (B_), b recessive (bb): 2 * 1 = 2\n- B recessive, b dominant (Bb, bb): 2 * 2 = 4\n- B recessive, b recessive (bb, bb): 1\n- B dominant, b dominant (B_, B_): 2 * 2 = 4\n\nAdding these: 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11, still not 16.\n\nWait, I must be making a mistake here.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's about a dihybrid cross between two birds, one that's checkered red and another that's plain brown. The goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let me break down what's given. The parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). So, each bird has two alleles for both genes. Let me write them out:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nSince they're dihybrids, we'll need to look at each trait separately and then combine the results. But wait, since the parents have different genotypes, their offspring will be a mix based on Mendel's laws.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the F1 generation from the cross. But wait, the user already provided the F1 gametes as CB, cb, cB, and cb. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the F2 now.\n\nThe F1 would be CcBb because each parent gives half of their chromosomes. Now, when we do a self-pollination (which makes up the F2), each bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. \n\nSo, the F2 generation will have these gametes combining in all possible ways. That means there will be 16 possible combinations, but some will result in the same genotype. For example, CB and cb can pair with each other, leading to CcBB, CcBb, etc., while CB paired with CB gives CcBB again? Wait, no, actually, each combination leads to a unique genotype if considering all possible pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible F2 genotypes. Since each parent contributes four types of gametes, the Punnett square would indeed have 16 possibilities. However, some will lead to the same genotype. For instance, pairing CB with CB gives CcBB, CB with cb gives CcBb, CB with cB gives CcBB again, and CB with cb gives CcBb again. Similarly, cb with cb gives ccbb, which is the F2 individual. So, after accounting for duplicates, the number might not reduce, but perhaps some genotypes are more common.\n\nBut maybe instead of counting all 16, I should calculate the actual counts for each genotype. Alternatively, perhaps using probability would be easier. Let me think about that.\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so I can calculate the probabilities for each trait first and then combine them.\n\nFor the first gene (gene B for color):\n- Parent 1: CC (homozygous dominant)\n- Parent 2: cc (homozygous recessive)\nCrossing them: All F1 will be Cc.\nIn F2:\n- Probability of CC = 25% (from Punnett square: Cc x Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Probability of cc = 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (gene b for color):\n- Parent 1: BB (homozygous dominant)\n- Parent 2: bb (homozygous recessive)\nCrossing them: All F1 will be Bb.\nIn F2:\n- Probability of BB = 25%\n- Probability of Bb = 50%\n- Probability of bb = 25%\n\nNow, assuming independence between the two genes, the combined probabilities for each trait combination would multiply. So, for example, the probability of having checkered (CC) and red (BB) would be 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Checkered red: CC BB = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: CC bb = 6.25%\n- Plain red: cc BB = 6.25%\n- Plain brown: cc bb = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that seems off because adding all four would give 25%, but the options suggest larger numbers. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes translate into counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each gene is controlled separately and their independent assortment leads to specific phenotypic ratios. But the question mentions checking the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, the options provided seem to have higher numbers like 6, 2, 4, etc. So, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has its own segregation ratio. For a monohybrid cross (two alleles), the typical ratio is 3:1. But here, we're dealing with a dihybrid cross, so the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, but scaled depending on dominance.\n\nWait, but the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, the F1 would be CcBB (since each parent contributes C and B respectively?), no, wait. Let me correct that. Each parent contributes one allele each. So, the F1 would get one allele from each parent. Parent 1 is CC BB, so C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so c and b. So, each F1 gets C or c and B or b. Therefore, the F1 genotypes would be CcBB, CcBb, CccB, and Cccb. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each parent contributes one allele, so the F1 would be Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene. So, F1 genotypes are CcBb, which is the heterozygote for both traits.\n\nThen, when selfing (or in this case, creating the F2), the F2 would have various combinations. So, let's think about the F2:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the first gene (color B):\n\nParent 1: CC\nParent 2: cc\nSo, F1 (and F2) will have a 1:1 ratio for the alleles. Thus, F2 for gene B will be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the second gene (color b):\n\nParent 1: BB\nParent 2: bb\nSo, F2 will have 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities for each trait combination are multiplied. So:\n\n- Both traits dominant (checkered red): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- First dominant, second recessive (checkered brown): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- First recessive, second dominant (plain red): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Both recessive (plain brown): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nBut the options don't have fractions; they have whole numbers. So perhaps we're looking at the phenotypic ratios without scaling to percentages, meaning each possible phenotype occurs according to the proportion of their genetic contributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented as ratios of counts rather than percentages.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 (if summing all)\n\nL. 1, 2, 6, 3 (if considering dominance)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct way is to realize that each gene segregates independently, so the phenotypic ratio combines the ratios of each gene.\n\nThe phenotypes depend on whether an animal is dominant or recessive for each gene. So, for each trait, the dominant phenotype will take the majority.\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation should have 9 possible phenotypes, but due to dominance, some may combine into fewer categories.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio among the checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nFrom our earlier analysis, the F2 should have four possible phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes being dominant or recessive.\n\nSo, let's calculate the proportions:\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- Dominant (red): 75% (25% CC + 50% Cc)\n- Recessive (brown): 25% (25% cc)\n\nFor Gene b (color):\n- Dominant (red): 75% (25% BB + 50% Bb)\n- Recessive (brown): 25% (25% bb)\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\nDominant B and dominant b: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (75%)\nDominant B and recessive b: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\nRecessive B and dominant b: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\nRecessive B and recessive b: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypic ratios:\n\nCheckered Red: 75% (1.5 parts if total is 3, but let's scale appropriately)\nCheckered Brown: 18.75% (0.3 parts)\nPlain Red: 18.75% (0.3 parts)\nPlain Brown: 6.25% (0.1 part)\n\nBut to express this as a ratio, we can multiply each percentage by 16 to eliminate decimals. 75%*16=12, 18.75%*16=3, 18.75%*16=3, 6.25%*16=1. So the ratio becomes 12:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option K says \"12, 2, 2, 0\", which isn't matching. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which also sums to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2014doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the dominance. If \"dominant\" is represented by the presence of at least one dominant allele, then the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Dominant B and Dominant b: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 9/16\n- Dominant B and Recessive b: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 3/16\n- Recessive B and Dominant b: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 3/16\n- Recessive B and Recessive b: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown.\n\nBut none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1 except option K and option G. Option K is 12,2,2,0\u2014which doesn't fit. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which also doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance refers to the actual pigmentation, where only certain alleles produce visible colors. So, maybe the presence of dominant alleles leads to a certain phenotype, and recessive ones are the opposite.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nFor color B:\n- Dominant (Red): 75%\n- Recessive (Brown): 25%\n\nFor color b:\n- Dominant (Red): 75%\n- Recessive (Brown): 25%\n\nAssuming these are independent, the phenotypic ratio is still 9:3:3:1, but expressed differently.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the reverse of what we have. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which adds to 16 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but expressed as 12:3:3:1 if considering the sum correctly. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, another approach: Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, so when combined, it's 9:3:3:1. This would correspond to checkered red (9 parts), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1).\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match this. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption K: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but 12+2+2+0=16.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Same as K.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16, but reversed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but likely the intended answer is option G, which is 12,2,2,0, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance.\n\nWait, another thought: If \"dominant\" in the context of pigmentation means that the presence of any dominant allele leads to a particular color. Suppose that for color B, BB and Bb produce red, and bb produces brown. For color b, BB and Bb produce brown, and bb produces red.\n\nBut that complicates things because now both traits are influenced by the same alleles.\n\nThis would mean that the F2 phenotypes depend on whether each trait is dominant or recessive.\n\nSo, for each bird, the color B and color b could be either dominant or recessive, independent of each other.\n\nSo, the possible combinations would be:\n\n- B dominant and b dominant \u2192 red (both)\n- B dominant and b recessive \u2192 red\n- B recessive and b dominant \u2192 red\n- B recessive and b recessive \u2192 brown\n\nSame logic applies to color b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Both dominant: red\n2. One dominant, one recessive: red\n3. Both recessive: brown\n\nSo, regardless of which gene is dominant, as long as both are recessive, it's brown. Otherwise, it's red.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 12:3:3:0 if considering all possible combinations.\n\nWait, but this depends on the exact dominance rules. If both traits are required to be recessive for brown, otherwise red, then:\n\nNumber of reds: All except those with both traits recessive.\n\nThere are 16 possible genotypes in F2.\n\nNumber of green (brown) birds: Only the one where both color B and color b are recessive: 1 bird.\n\nSo, red:15, brown:1 \u2192 Ratio 15:1, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, if each trait is independent:\n\n- Both dominant: red\n- One dominant, one recessive: red\n- Both recessive: brown\n\nSo, the number of red birds: (number of B dominant * number of b dominant) + (number of B dominant * number of b recessive) + (number of B recessive * number of b dominant) ) + (number of B recessive * number of b recessive )\n\nWhich is:\n\n(2 * 2) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 reds, 3 browns \u2192 13:3.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of each phenotype.\n\nEach gene has 4 possible outcomes (2^2), so F2 has 16.\n\nNumber of checkered red: Genotypes where B is dominant and b is recessive.\n\nWait, no. Checkered red implies that color B is dominant and color b is recessive.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown is B recessive and b dominant.\n\nPlain red is B recessive and b recessive.\n\nPlain brown is B dominant and b dominant.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: B dominant, b recessive \u2192 2 * 2 = 4\n- Checkered brown: B recessive, b dominant \u2192 2 * 2 = 4\n- Plain red: B recessive, b recessive \u2192 1\n- Plain brown: B dominant, b dominant \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nWait, but 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 1 plain brown. Sum to 10, but that doesn't add up to 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm double-counting.\n\nNo, each bird has only one genotype, so:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 1\nSum: 10, which is less than 16. Where are the remaining 6?\n\nAh, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is:\n\n- B dominant (B_), b recessive (bb): 2 * 1 = 2\n- B recessive, b dominant (Bb, bb): 2 * 2 = 4\n- B recessive, b recessive (bb, bb): 1\n- B dominant, b dominant (B_, B_): 2 * 2 = 4\n\nAdding these: 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11, still not 16.\n\nWait, I must be making a mistake here. Let me use a Punnett square approach properly.\n\nEach parent contributes two alleles:\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nPossible gametes for Parent 1:\n- C (with probability 1)\n- C (probability",

    "rollout": " Let me start by breaking down what's given.\n\nWe have two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means its genotype is CC BB. The other bird is plain brown, so its genotype must be cc bb because brown is recessive. \n\nThe traits are controlled by two pairs of genes: one pair for color (C/B for dominant) and another for penguin shape (c/b). So, each bird has two alleles for each trait. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the possible offspring from this cross using a Punnett square. Since both parents are homozygous (one bird is CC BB and the other is cc bb), all their gametes should be the same as their own alleles. So, the gametes will be CB and cb.\n\nWhen we make the Punnett square, it'll look like this:\n\n          | CB   | cb\n        -----------------\n        CB     | CcBB | Ccbb\n        cb      | CcBB | c c bb\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you're making the Punnett square for two parents who are both homozygous but different in both traits, the possible combinations are just the products of their gametes. So, since one parent can only give CB or cb, and the other can only give CB or cb, the cross would result in four possible combinations: CB x CB, CB x cb, cb x CB, and cb x cb.\n\nSo, the F1 generation would have four possible genotypes: CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccbb. Now, let's map these to phenotypes.\n\nFor color:\n- C_B_: Checkered red (since C is dominant)\n- c_bb: Plain red (since c is recessive)\n\nFor shape:\n- C_ : Checkered\n- c_ : Plain\n\nSo, combining these, the phenotypes would be:\n- CcBB \u2192 Checkered red\n- Ccbb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBB \u2192 Plain red\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, looking at the F1 generation, how many of each phenotype do we expect? Well, there are four individuals in total. Assuming they're all equally likely, each has a 25% chance. But wait, actually, the F1 generation comes from two F1 parents being crossed, so it's an F2 generation relative to the F1 parents. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify. The initial cross is between a CC BB bird and a cc bb bird. Their F1 generation would consist of four birds, each with either CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, or ccbb. Then, if we consider F1 as the parents for the next cross (to get F2), but perhaps the problem is asking about the F2 generation based on the initial cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits. Wait, no, the parents here are homozygous. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nThe problem says: \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, the parents are homozygous, meaning they can only produce one type of gamete. So, the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in four offspring: CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccbb.\n\nEach of these four offspring will then undergo selfing or interbreeding to form the F2 generation. Wait, no, the question is about the F2 generation after the initial cross. Maybe it's better to think of it as starting from a dihybrid cross.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 generation would be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccbb, each with equal probability. So, each has a 25% chance. Therefore, when considering the F2 generation, assuming each F1 individual is the parent for the next cross, the probabilities would come from those.\n\nWait, but the question is about the F2 generation relative to the initial cross, not from the F1 parents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits, but the setup here isn't that.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, so each bird has two genes, one determining color (C/B) and one determining shape (c/b).\n\nTherefore, each bird has two alleles for color and two for shape.\n\nSo, the parents are:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (so both color is C, both shape is B)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (so both color is c, both shape is b)\n\nThe F1 generation would be the combination of these, so all four possible gametes (each bird can only contribute one allele for each gene, but since the parents are homozygous, all gametes are the same).\n\nThus, the F1 would be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, ccbb.\n\nNow, to find the F2 generation, we'd assume these F1 parents are crossed together. So, each F1 bird can produce gametes: for color (Cc and cc), and for shape (BB and bb).\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\nColor:\n- Cc x Cc \u2192 C_C_, so possible phenotypes: Checkered (C_) and plain (cc)\n- cc x cc \u2192 plain (cc)\n\nShape:\n- BB x BB \u2192 Checkered (BB)\n- BB x bb \u2192 Checkered (Bb)\n- bb x BB \u2192 Checkered (Bb)\n- bb x bb \u2192 plain (bb)\n\nBut since both genes are independent, we combine the results.\n\nWait, actually, the correct way is to consider both genes separately. Each gene is controlled independently, so the F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the phenotypic ratios for each gene.\n\nFor color:\n- C_: Checkered (probability 3/4)\n- cc: Plain (probability 1/4)\n\nFor shape:\n- BB: Checkered (probability 3/4)\n- bb: Plain (probability 1/4)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is (Checkered * Checkered) + (Checkered * Plain) + (Plain * Checkered) + (Plain * Plain).\n\nCalculating each term:\n- Checkered * Checkered = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered * Plain = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain * Checkered = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain * Plain = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1 (which checks out).\n\nSo, the expected phenotypic ratio is:\n(3/4)*Checkered * (3/4)*Checkered = 9 Checkered Checkered,\n(3/4)*Checkered * (1/4)*Plain = 3 Checkered Plain,\n(1/4)*Checkered * (3/4)*Plain = 3 Checkered Plain,\n(1/4)*Checkered * (1/4)*Plain = 1 Checkered Plain,\n\nSimilarly for brown:\n(3/4)*Plain * (3/4)*Checkered = 9 Plain Checkered,\n(3/4)*Plain * (1/4)*Plain = 3 Plain Plain,\n(1/4)*Plain * (3/4)*Checkered = 3 Plain Checkered,\n(1/4)*Plain * (1/4)*Plain = 1 Plain Plain,\n\nCombining all, the overall phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the number of Checkered Checkered, Checkered Plain, Plain Checkered, and Plain Plain.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which also doesn't fit. Option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which matches our ratio except scaled up. Wait, no, 9:3:3:1 could correspond to 9 Checkered Checkered, etc., but none of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypic classes.\n\nIn the question, the colors are red and brown, and the shapes are checkered and plain.\n\nWait, in my previous analysis, I considered red as dominant for color, but according to the problem statement, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele (B) for color would be red. Brown would require the recessive allele (b).\n\nSame for shape: dominant is B, recessive is b.\n\nSo, going back to the F2 generation phenotypes:\n\nCheckered Checkered: All have at least one C (for color) and at least one B (for shape). So, regardless of whether they have a dominant or recessive allele, as long as they meet the criteria.\n\nBut in terms of the actual phenotype, red is dominant over brown, and checkered is dominant over plain. So, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Both dominant traits: Checkered Checkered (red red)\n2. Color dominant, shape recessive: Checkered Brown (red brown)\n3. Color recessive, shape dominant: Plain Checkered (brown red)\n4. Both recessive traits: Plain Brown (brown brown)\n\nSo, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1 for these classes.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says 12 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, etc., which seems scaled up. None of the options match exactly 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the options use a different scale, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, looking at the options more carefully:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This is a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which would imply a dihybrid cross without scaling factors, but the expected is 9:3:3:1. So, this might be incorrect.\n\nOption A: 6,2,2,6 \u2013 this is similar to 9:3:3:1 scaled down, but not matching exactly.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2013 this is 3 Checkered red, 9 Checkered brown, which doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2013 summing to 12, which doesn't align with 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 ratio. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the F2 generation is derived from F1 parents crossing. If the F1 parents are both Cc BB and cc bb, then each F1 bird can produce gametes Cc (for color) and BB (for shape) for one parent, and cc (for color) and bb (for shape) for the other.\n\nWait, no, actually, the F1 parents are Cc BB and cc bb. So, each parent can produce gametes:\n\nFor color:\n- Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n\nFor shape:\n- BB: 100% B\n- bb: 100% b\n\nSo, the F1 x F1 cross would involve each parent contributing one allele for color and one for shape.\n\nThus, the color phenotypes depend on the gametes: C or c.\n\nThe shape depends on the gametes: B or b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is (number of C gametes / total gametes)^2 multiplied by (number of B gametes / total gametes)^2, etc.\n\nWait, more accurately, the F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated by considering all possible combinations.\n\nFor color:\n- Probability of C_: 3/4 (since Cc x Cc)\n- Probability of cc: 1/4\n\nFor shape:\n- Probability of BB: 3/4\n- Probability of bb: 1/4\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4) = 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Looking back, option G says 12 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, etc., which sums to 16, matching the 9+3+3+1=16. But the actual counts are 9 Checkered Checkered, 3 Checkered Brown, etc. So, option G's numbers don't match the expected 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the question expects a simplified version or uses a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the F2 generation differently, such as considering the entire population rather than the F2 itself. But that wouldn't change the ratio significantly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the F2 generation. If the F1 parents are crossed, the F2 would have the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, the question asks for the F2 generation in terms of phenotypes, which should follow this ratio.\n\nGiven that, none of the options directly match 9:3:3:1, but option G says 12,2,2,0, which adds up to 16. Maybe it's scaled by a factor of 4, but that would complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the parents as CcBB and ccbb. Wait, no, the F1 should be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, ccbb.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F2 generation of the initial cross, not the F2 of the F1. If the initial cross produces four F1, and then those F1 are crossed among themselves, leading to the F2. In that case, the F2 would still have the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, none of the options perfectly match, but perhaps the answer intended is option G, but with a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a dihybrid cross without considering both traits independently, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the question is considering the F2 generation relative to the F1 parents, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation instead of F2, but that's not what it says.\n\nWait, the question specifically says \"F2 generation,\" so I have to stick with the F2 ratio derived from the F1 parents. Given that, the closest option is G, which sums to 16, matching the denominator of 16, but the numerator isn't correctly divided into 9:3:3:1. So, perhaps the correct answer is G, even though it doesn't strictly match the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the calculations. Let me recalculate the F2 ratio properly.\n\nFor color:\n- C_: 3/4\n- cc: 1/4\n\nFor shape:\n- BB: 3/4\n- bb: 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is:\n\n(C_: 3/4) * (BB: 3/4) = 9/16 Checkered Checkered\n(C_: 3/4) * (bb: 1/4) = 3/16 Checkered Brown\n(cc: 1/4) * (BB: 3/4) = 3/16 Brown Checkered\n(cc: 1/4) * (bb: 1/4) = 1/16 Brown Brown\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is the only one that sums to 16 (9+3+3+1=16), but the distribution isn't correct. The other options don't match the required 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option G, despite the mismatch in the specific counts, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by breaking down what's given.\n\nWe have two birds crossing their genes. One bird is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means its genotype is CC BB. The other bird is plain brown, so its genotype must be cc bb because brown is recessive. \n\nThe traits are controlled by two pairs of genes: one pair for color (C/B for dominant) and another for penguin shape (c/b). So, each bird has two alleles for each trait. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the possible offspring from this cross using a Punnett square. Since both parents are homozygous (one bird is CC BB and the other is cc bb), all their gametes should be the same as their own alleles. So, the gametes will be CB and cb.\n\nWhen we make the Punnett square, it'll look like this:\n\n          | CB   | cb\n        -----------------\n        CB     | CcBB | Ccbb\n        cb      | CcBB | c c bb\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you're making the Punnett square for two parents who are both homozygous but different in both traits, the possible combinations are just the products of their gametes. So, since one parent can only give CB or cb, and the other can only give CB or cb, the cross would result in four possible combinations: CB x CB, CB x cb, cb x CB, and cb x cb.\n\nSo, the F1 generation would have four possible genotypes: CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccbb. Now, let's map these to phenotypes.\n\nFor color:\n- C_B_: Checkered red (since C is dominant)\n- c_bb: Plain red (since c is recessive)\n\nFor shape:\n- C_ : Checkered\n- c_ : Plain\n\nSo, combining these, the phenotypes would be:\n- CcBB \u2192 Checkered red\n- Ccbb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBB \u2192 Plain red\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, looking at the F1 generation, how many of each phenotype do we expect? Well, there are four individuals in total. Assuming they're all equally likely, each has a 25% chance. But wait, actually, the F1 generation comes from two F1 parents being crossed, so it's an F2 generation relative to the F1 parents. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify. The initial cross is between a CC BB bird and a cc bb bird. Their F1 generation would consist of four birds, each with either CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, or ccbb. Then, if we consider F1 as the parents for the next cross (to get F2), but perhaps the problem is asking about the F2 generation based on the initial cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits. Wait, no, the parents here are homozygous. Let me re-examine the setup.\n\nThe problem says: \"adahybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, the parents are homozygous, meaning they can only produce one type of gamete. So, the cross is between CC BB and cc bb, resulting in four offspring: CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccbb.\n\nEach of these four offspring will then undergo selfing or interbreeding to form the F2 generation. Wait, no, the question is about the F2 generation after the initial cross. Maybe it's better to think of it as starting from a dihybrid cross.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 generation would be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, and ccbb, each with equal probability. So, each has a 25% chance. Therefore, when considering the F2 generation, assuming each F1 individual is the parent for the next cross, the probabilities would come from those.\n\nWait, but the question is about the F2 generation relative to the initial cross, not from the F1 parents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits, but the setup here isn't that.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, so each bird has two genes, one determining color (C/B) and one determining shape (c/b).\n\nTherefore, each bird has two alleles for color and two for shape.\n\nSo, the parents are:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (so both color is C, both shape is B)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (so both color is c, both shape is b)\n\nThe F1 generation would be the combination of these, so all four possible gametes (each bird can only contribute one allele for each gene, but since the parents are homozygous, all gametes are the same).\n\nThus, the F1 would be CcBB, Ccbb, ccBB, ccbb.\n\nNow, to find the F2 generation, we'd assume these F1 parents are crossed together. So, each F1 bird can produce gametes: for color (Cc and cc), and for shape (BB and bb).\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\nColor:\n- Cc x Cc \u2192 C_C_, so possible phenotypes: Checkered (C_) and plain (cc)\n- cc x cc \u2192 plain (cc)\n\nShape:\n- BB x BB \u2192 Checkered (BB)\n- BB x bb \u2192 Checkered (Bb)\n- bb x BB \u2192 Checkered (Bb)\n- bb x bb \u2192 plain (bb)\n\nBut since both genes are independent, we combine the results.\n\nWait, actually, the correct way is to consider both genes separately. Each gene is controlled independently, so the F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the phenotypic ratios for each gene.\n\nFor color:\n- C_: Checkered (probability 3/4)\n- cc: Plain (probability 1/4)\n\nFor shape:\n- BB: Checkered (probability 3/4)\n- bb: Plain (probability 1/4)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is (Checkered * Checkered) + (Checkered * Plain) + (Plain * Checkered) + (Plain * Plain).\n\nCalculating each term:\n- Checkered * Checkered = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered * Plain = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain * Checkered = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain * Plain = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1 (which checks out).\n\nSo, the expected phenotypic ratio is:\n(3/4)*Checkered * (3/4)*Checkered = 9 Checkered Checkered,\n(3/4)*Checkered * (1/4)*Plain = 3 Checkered Plain,\n(1/4)*Checkered * (3/4)*Plain = 3 Checkered Plain,\n(1/4)*Checkered * (1/4)*Plain = 1 Checkered Plain,\n\nSimilarly for brown:\n(3/4)*Plain * (3/4)*Checkered = 9 Plain Checkered,\n(3/4)*Plain * (1/4)*Plain = 3 Plain Plain,\n(1/4)*Plain * (3/4)*Checkered = 3 Plain Checkered,\n(1/4)*Plain * (1/4)*Plain = 1 Plain Plain,\n\nCombining all, the overall phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the number of Checkered Checkered, Checkered Plain, Plain Checkered, and Plain Plain.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which also doesn't fit. Option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which matches our ratio except scaled up. Wait, no, 9:3:3:1 could correspond to 9 Checkered Checkered, etc., but none of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypic classes.\n\nIn the question, the colors are red and brown, and the shapes are checkered and plain.\n\nWait, in my previous analysis, I considered red as dominant for color, but according to the problem statement, red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele (B) for color would be red.

So, the phenotypic classes would be:\n\n1. Both dominant traits: Checkered Checkered (red red)\n2. Color dominant, shape recessive: Checkered Brown (red brown)\n3. Color recessive, shape dominant: Plain Checkered (brown red)\n4. Both recessive traits: Plain Brown (brown brown)\n\nSo, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1 for these classes.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says 12 Checkered red, 2 Checkered brown, etc., which seems scaled up. None of the options match exactly 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the options use a different scale, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, looking at the options more carefully:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This is a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which would imply a dihybrid cross without scaling factors, but the expected is 9:3:3:1. So, this might be incorrect.\n\nOption A: 6,2,2,6 \u2013 this is similar to 9:3:3:1 scaled down, but not matching exactly.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2013 this is 3 Checkered red, 9 Checkered brown, which doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2013 summing to 12, which doesn't align with 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 ratio. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the F2 generation is derived from F1 parents crossing. If the F1 parents are both Cc BB and cc bb, then each F1 bird can produce gametes Cc (for color) and BB (for shape) for one parent, and cc (for color) and bb (for shape) for the other.\n\nWait, no, actually, the F1 parents are Cc BB and cc bb. So, each parent can produce gametes:\n\nFor color:\n- Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n\nFor shape:\n- BB: 100% B\n- bb: 100% b\n\nSo, the F1 x F1 cross would involve each parent contributing one allele for color and one for shape.\n\nThus, the color phenotypes depend on the gametes: C or c.\n\nThe shape depends on the gametes: B or b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is (number of C gametes / total gametes)^2 multiplied by (number of B gametes / total gametes)^2, etc.\n\nWait, more accurately, the F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated by considering all possible combinations.\n\nFor color:\n- Probability of C_: 3/4 (since Cc x Cc)\n- Probability of cc: 1/4\n\nFor shape:\n- Probability of BB: 3/4\n- Probability of bb: 1/4\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4) = 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly.

So the genotype would be CCBB. The other bird is a plain brown bird, meaning its genotype is ccbb because 'c' is the recessive allele for brown and 'b' is for blue. Wait, but in the initial description, it says that red is controlled by B and brown by b, while checkered is C and plain by c. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong earlier. Let's clarify:\n\n- Checkered (homozygous) red bird: Both genes are dominant, so it should have at least one dominant allele. Since it's checkered, perhaps each gene is dominant? Or maybe the first part refers to the pigment pattern, where \"checkered\" could mean that both pigments are present. But more likely, since it's a dominant gene C for checkered, and another gene B for red, but wait no\u2014the problem states checkered as dominant, plain as recessive, and red and brown based on B and b. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, let me read again carefully:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Plain color is determined by recessive allele c. Red color is B, brown by b. So each bird has two alleles for color: one from each parent. So for example, if you're a heterozygote for color, you'd have either B or b. Similarly, for pigment patterns, each bird has two alleles for pigment color: one from each parent.\n\nSo the initial cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). Wait, no\u2014plain color is determined by the recessive allele c, but red is determined by B. Wait, hold on. If the bird is plain color, then both its pigment alleles must be recessive, i.e., bb. But the problem says plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Wait, that doesn't make sense because c would be for something else. Maybe there was a mistake in translation. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is:\n\n- Dominant allele C produces checkered pigment.\n- Recessive allele c results in plain color (so any phenotype without C is plain).\nSimilarly,\n- Dominant allele B gives red color.\n- Recessive allele b gives brown.\n\nBut the initial problem says checkered is dominant, plain is recessive, red is B, brown is b. So the birds have two color genes: one determining checkered/pineapple-like pattern (gene C) and another determining whether they are red (B) or brown (b).\n\nGiven that, let's parse the parents:\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red bird \u2192 CC BB (since checkered is dominant, and red is B)\nParent 2: Plain brown bird \u2192 cc bb (plain is recessive for color, brown is dominant? Wait, no\u2014if plain is recessive, then brown is dominant. Because if the bird is not plain (i.e., has at least one dominant allele), then it can be red or brown.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's break it down:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for color: one for pigment (B/b) and one for pattern (C/c).\n\n- Dominant pigment allele (B) results in red.\n- Recessive pigment allele (b) results in brown.\n\n- Dominant pattern allele (C) results in checkered (pale)\n- Recessive pattern allele (c) results in plain.\n\nSo Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB.\n\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 cc bb.\n\nNow, when these two are crossed:\n\nParent 1 x Parent 2.\n\nThe possible gametes from Parent 1 will be CB (since both alleles are C and B).\n\nThe possible gametes from Parent 2 will be cb (both alleles are c and b).\n\nSo the F1 generation will be CcBb.\n\nNow, we need to consider an F2 generation. Wait, actually, the problem asks about the F2 generation after crossing a F1 bird with itself. Alternatively, perhaps it's an F2 cross considering F1 selfing. Wait, the initial cross is between CCBB and ccbb, which produce F1 of CcBb. Then, the F1 is crossed with itself to get F2. So the F2 generation will consist of four F1 birds, each producing gametes for the next generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to model this as a dihybrid cross with independent assortment, given that each bird has two separate traits (color and pattern), and their genes are independently assorting.\n\nLet me approach this using a Punnett square method for the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, identify the parents involved in the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, each F1 bird contributes one allele for each gene. The possible gametes from each F1 bird are:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- C (from CC)\n- c (from Cc)\n\nFor the B gene:\n- B (from BB)\n- b (from Bb)\n\nSince the two genes are linked or independent? The problem didn't specify linkage, so I'll assume they assort independently. However, in reality, many genes are linked, but without information, we proceed under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nThus, the F2 will have four types of F1 birds, each contributing one allele for each gene. Each gene has two possibilities, leading to 2x2=4 combinations:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBb\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb\n3. cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBb\n4. cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb\n\nSo all F1 birds will be CcBb, but the actual gamete types depend on the segregation. Assuming independent assortment, each F1 bird will produce four types of gametes:\n\nFor C:\n- 25% C (CC)\n- 50% c (Cc)\n- 25% c (Cc)\n\nFor B:\n- 25% B (BB)\n- 50% b (Bb)\n- 25% b (Bb)\n\nSo the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each with probabilities calculated by multiplying the gamete fractions.\n\nHowever, since the problem mentions checking for the phenotypic ratios, let's determine the phenotypes based on the combination of alleles.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color:\n  - B \u2192 Red\n  - b \u2192 Brown\n\n- Pattern:\n  - C \u2192 Checkered\n  - c \u2192 Plain\n\nEach bird has two alleles, one for each trait. The phenotype depends on both traits.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations and determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB:\n   - C \u00d7 B = Red\n   - C \u00d7 B = Checkered\n   \u2192 Red Checkered\n\n2. CC \u00d7 Bb:\n   - C \u00d7 B = Red\n   - C \u00d7 b = Brown\n   \u2192 Red Brown\n\n3. cc \u00d7 BB:\n   - c \u00d7 B = Brown\n   - c \u00d7 B = Plain\n   \u2192 Brown Plain\n\n4. cc \u00d7 Bb:\n   - c \u00d7 B = Brown\n   - c \u00d7 b = Plain\n   \u2192 Brown Plain\n\nWait, but this seems incomplete. Actually, each bird has two alleles for each trait, so for pigment color, each gene is independent. Thus, for pigment color, each bird has a 50% chance of being B or b, and similarly for pattern.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation will have 16 birds, each with a random combination of alleles.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, let's calculate how many birds fall into each category:\n\nRed Checkered: Occurs when both alleles are B (red) and C (checkered). So the genotype is BB C C. Probability: (1/4) for B (since 50% B and 50% b, so 25% BB) multiplied by (1/4 for C) \u2192 1/16.\n\nRed Brown: When B is present (so 3/4 chance) and c (so 1/4) \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16.\n\nBrown Plain: When b (1/4) and c (1/4) \u2192 1/16.\n\nBrown Checkered: Impossible because to have a C (checkered) and b (brown), the genotype would be BC bc. But since each gene is independent, the probability is 1/4 (for B) * 1/4 (for c) = 1/16.\n\nWait, no. To have checkered, the pattern gene must be C (so both alleles are C or one C and one c?), wait no: For checkered, the bird must express C, regardless of the pattern. So, to have checkered, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for pattern. So, the only way to have checkered and brown is BC bc. So, yes, 1/16.\n\nWait, no, because for pattern, if both alleles are c, it's plain; otherwise, checkered. So, to have checkered, at least one C is needed, and for brown, at least one b is needed. So the only possibility for both is BC and bc, which is 1/16.\n\nWait, but for pigment color, the presence of B makes it red, regardless of pattern. So:\n\nRed Checkered: BB C C \u2192 1/16\n\nRed Brown: BB C c \u2192 3/16\n\nBrown Checkered: BB c c \u2192 1/16\n\nBrown Plain: Bb C c \u2192 3/16\n\nWait, no: Brown Checkered occurs when pigment is brown (at least one b) and pattern is checkered (at least one C). So the genotype would be Bb C c or Bb cc?\n\nNo, wait: For pattern, if any C is present, it's checkered; if any c is present, it's plain. Pigment color is determined by B and b, so if B is present, it's red; if b, brown.\n\nSo for Brown Checkered, genotype needs to be Bb (any b allele) and at least one C (so Bb CC, Bb Cc, Bb cc, etc.), but wait, no. Wait, for pattern, if any C is present, it's checkered; brown is only when all C are absent (i.e., cc). Wait, no: Pigment color is determined by B and b; brown is when b is present, regardless of pattern. Pattern is determined by C and c; checkered is when C is present, regardless of pattern.\n\nSo to have Brown Checkered:\n\n- Pigment: At least one b (so genotype has bb)\n- Pattern: At least one C (so genotype has CC or Cc)\n\nSo the possible genotypes for Brown Checkered are:\n\n- bb CC\n- bb Cc\n\nThese are two distinct genotypes. Now, calculating their probabilities:\n\nProbability of bb (pigment): 1/4 (since B is dominant, so 3/4 chance to have at least one B, 1/4 to have bb)\nProbability of CC: 1/4 (since C is dominant)\nProbability of Cc: 1/4 (since Cc is 50%)\nWait, no: For each gene, the alleles are independent.\n\nActually, for each gene, the probability of a specific genotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment color (B/b):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nFor pattern color (C/c):\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the joint probabilities multiply.\n\nSo Brown Checkered requires:\n\n- Pigment: bb (prob 1/4)\n- Pattern: CC (prob 1/4)\n\u2192 Joint prob: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSimilarly, Brown Plain requires:\n\n- Pigment: bb (prob 1/4)\n- Pattern: cc (prob 1/4)\n\u2192 Joint prob: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nCheckered Brown: same as Brown Checkered \u2192 1/16\n\nCheckered Red: requires:\n\n- Pigment: BB (prob 1/4)\n- Pattern: CC (prob 1/4)\n\u2192 1/16\n\nWait, no: Checkered is determined by the pattern gene. So if the bird has at least one C (pattern checkered), regardless of pigment. Pigment is red if at least one B.\n\nSo to have Checkered Red, the bird must have at least one C and at least one B.\n\nSo the genotype must be:\n\n- CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\nCalculating probabilities:\n\nProbability of CC (pattern): 25% for each bird, so overall 25% * 50% (B present) = 12.5%?\nWait, no: The combined probability for pattern CC and pigment BB is (1/4 for CC) * (1/4 for BB) = 1/16.\n\nSimilarly, for CC Bb: (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8\nFor Cc BB: (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\nFor Cc Bb: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4 = 1/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 4/16 = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, for Checkered Brown, the phenotype is brown due to pattern, but checkered due to pigment. So the genotype must have at least one C (pattern) and at least one b (pigment). So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Bb CC, Bb Cc, Bb cc, Bb cc, etc.? No, better to use the same logic:\n\nGenotype must have at least one C (pattern) and at least one b (pigment). So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Bb CC (pigment: B, pattern: C)\n- Bb Cc (pigment: B, pattern: c)\n- Bb cc (pigment: b, pattern: c)\n- Bb cc (same as above)\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nWait, for pigment color, to have brown (b), the bird must have at least one b. For pattern, to have checkered (C), at least one C.\n\nSo the possible genotypes are those where at least one C and at least one b.\n\nLooking at all possible combinations:\n\n1. BB BB: Pigment: B (red), Pattern: B (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n2. BB Bb: Pigment: B (red), Pattern: b (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n3. BB CC: Pigment: B, Pattern: C \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. BB Cc: Pigment: B, Pattern: c \u2192 Red Plain\n5. BB bb: Pigment: B, Pattern: b \u2192 Red Plain\n6. BB Bb: Same as 2\nWait, maybe it's easier to count all possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nTotal of 16 possible genotypes, each with equal probability (1/16):\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Checkered\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC CC \u2192 Red Checkered (since B is present, but C is dominant, so it's still red)\nWait no: Pigment color is determined by B and b. In CC, B is present (since C is dominant), so pigment is red. For pattern, CC is dominant, so checkered. So phenotype is Red Checkered.\n\n4. CC Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n5. CC cc \u2192 Red Plain\n6. CC BB \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n8. CC CC \u2192 Red Checkered\n9. CC Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n10. CC cc \u2192 Red Plain\n11. CC BB \u2192 Red Checkered\n12. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n13. CC CC \u2192 Red Checkered\n14. CC Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n15. CC cc \u2192 Red Plain\n16. CC BB \u2192 Red Checkered\n\nHmm, this approach might take too long. Instead, let me recall that the number of genotypes leading to each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Red Checkered: Requires B (pigment) and C (pattern)\n  Genotype: BB CC, BB Cc, Bb CC, Bb Cc\n  Number of such genotypes: 4\n  Probability: 4/16 = 1/4\n\n- Red Brown: Requires B and cc\n  Genotype: BB cc, Bb cc\n  Number: 2\n  Probability: 2/16 = 1/8\n\n- Brown Checkered: Requires bb (pigment) and CC (pattern)\n  Genotype: bb CC, bb Cc\n  Number: 2\n  Probability: 2/16 = 1/8\n\n- Brown Plain: Requires bb (pigment) and cc (pattern)\n  Genotype: bb cc\n  Number: 1\n  Probability: 1/16\n\nWait, no. Brown Plain requires both bb (pigment) and cc (pattern). So only one genotype: bb cc.\n\nSimilarly, Brown Checkered requires bb (pigment) and at least one C (pattern). So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- bb CC\n- bb Cc\n\nWhich are two types.\n\nSo their probabilities sum to 2/16 = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, Red Checkered is four types: BB CC, BB Cc, Bb CC, Bb Cc. So four cases.\n\nRed Brown is two types: BB cc, Bb cc. Two cases.\n\nSo now, let's map the phenotypes and their counts:\n\nPhenotype | Cases | Count\n---|---|---\nRed Checkered | 4 | 4\nRed Brown | 2 | 2\nBrown Checkered | 2 | 2\nBrown Plain | 1 | 1\nTotal | 9 | 16\n\nWait, but according to our previous calculation, the total cases should add up to 16.\n\nWait, no, according to the above table, the sum is 4+2+2+1=9, which is less than 16. That suggests an error in my counting.\n\nAh, I see. I forgot that for some genotypes, the pattern may vary. Let's recount correctly.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red Checkered** (BB CC, BB Cc, Bb CC, Bb Cc",

But since each gene is independent, the probability is 1/4 (for B) * 1/4 (for c) = 1/16.\n\nWait, no. To have checkered, the pattern gene must be C (so both alleles are C or one C and one c?), wait no: For checkered, the bird must express C, regardless of the pattern.

So:\n\nRed Checkered: BB C C \u2192 1/16\n\nRed Brown: BB C c \u2192 3/16\n\nBrown Checkered: BB c c \u2192 1/16\n\nBrown Plain: Bb C c \u2192 3/16\n\nWait, no: Brown Checkered occurs when pigment is brown (at least one b) and pattern is checkered (at least one C). So the genotype would be Bb C c or Bb cc?\n\nNo, wait: For pattern, if any C is present, it's checkered; if any c is present, it's plain. Pigment color is determined by B and b, so if B is present, it's red; if b, brown.\n\nSo for Brown Checkered, genotype needs to be Bb (any b allele) and at least one C (so Bb CC, Bb Cc, Bb cc, etc.), but wait, no. Wait, for pattern, if any C is present, it's checkered; brown is only when all C are absent (i.e., cc). Wait, no: Pigment color is determined by B and b; brown is when b is present, regardless of pattern. Pattern is determined by C and c; checkered is when C is present, regardless of pattern.\n\nSo to have Brown Checkered:\n\n- Pigment: At least one b (so genotype has bb)\n- Pattern: At least one C (so genotype has CC or Cc)\n\nSo the possible genotypes for Brown Checkered are:\n\n- bb CC\n- bb Cc\n\nThese are two distinct genotypes. Now, calculating their probabilities:\n\nProbability of bb (pigment): 1/4 (since B is dominant, so 3/4 chance to have at least one B, 1/4 to have bb)\nProbability of CC: 1/4 (since C is dominant)\nProbability of Cc: 1/4 (since Cc is 50%)\nWait, no: For each gene, the alleles are independent.\n\nActually, for each gene, the probability of a specific genotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor pigment color (B/b):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nFor pattern color (C/c):\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the joint probabilities multiply.\n\nSo Brown Checkered requires:\n\n- Pigment: bb (prob 1/4)\n- Pattern: CC (prob 1/4)\n\u2192 Joint prob: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSimilarly, Brown Plain requires:\n\n- Pigment: bb (prob 1/4)\n- Pattern: cc (prob 1/4)\n\u2192 Joint prob: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nCheckered Brown: same as Brown Checkered \u2192 1/16\n\nCheckered Red: requires:\n\n- Pigment: BB (prob 1/4)\n- Pattern: CC (prob 1/4)\n\u2192 1/16\n\nWait, no: Checkered is determined by the pattern gene. So if the bird has at least one C (pattern checkered), regardless of pigment. Pigment is red if at least one B.\n\nSo to have Checkered Red, the bird must have at least one C and at least one B.\n\nSo the genotype must be:\n\n- CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\nCalculating probabilities:\n\nProbability of CC (pattern): 25% for each bird, so overall 25% * 50% (B present) = 12.5%?\nWait, no: The combined probability for pattern CC and pigment BB is (1/4 for CC) * (1/4 for BB) = 1/16.\n\nSimilarly, for CC Bb: (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8\nFor Cc BB: (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8\nFor Cc Bb: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4 = 1/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 4/16 = 9/16\n\nSimilarly, for Checkered Brown, the phenotype is brown due to pattern, but checkered due to pigment. So the genotype must have at least one C (pattern) and at least one b (pigment). So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Bb CC, Bb Cc, Bb cc, Bb cc, etc.? No, better to use the same logic:\n\nGenotype must have at least one C (pattern) and at least one b (pigment). So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- Bb CC (pigment: B, pattern: C)\n- Bb Cc (pigment: B, pattern: c)\n- Bb cc (pigment: b, pattern: c)\n- Bb cc (same as above)\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\nWait, for pigment color, to have brown (b), the bird must have at least one b. For pattern, to have checkered (C), at least one C.\n\nSo the possible genotypes are those where at least one C and at least one b.\n\nLooking at all possible combinations:\n\n1. BB BB: Pigment: B (red), Pattern: B (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n2. BB Bb: Pigment: B (red), Pattern: b (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n3. BB CC: Pigment: B, Pattern: C \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. BB Cc: Pigment: B, Pattern: c \u2192 Red Plain\n5. BB bb: Pigment: B, Pattern: b \u2192 Red Plain\n6. BB Bb: Same as 2\nWait, maybe it's easier to count all possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nTotal of 16 possible genotypes, each with equal probability (1/16):\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Checkered\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC CC \u2192 Red Checkered (since B is present, but C is dominant, so it's still red)\nWait no: Pigment color is determined by B and b. In CC, B is present (since C is dominant), so pigment is red. For pattern, CC is dominant, so checkered. So phenotype is Red Checkered.\n\n4. CC Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n5. CC cc \u2192 Red Plain\n6. CC BB \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n8. CC CC \u2192 Red Checkered\n9. CC Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n10. CC cc \u2192 Red Plain\n11. CC BB \u2192 Red Checkered\n12. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n13. CC CC \u2192 Red Checkered\n14. CC Cc \u2192 Red Brown\n15. CC cc \u2192 Red Plain\n16. CC BB \u2192 Red Checkered\n\nHmm, this approach might take too long. Instead, let me recall that the number of genotypes leading to each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Red Checkered: Requires B (pigment) and C (pattern)\n  Genotype: BB CC, BB Cc, Bb CC, Bb Cc\n  Number of such genotypes: 4\n  Probability: 4/16 = 1/4\n\n- Red Brown: Requires B and cc\n  Genotype: BB cc, Bb cc\n  Number: 2\n  Probability: 2/16 = 1/8\n\n- Brown Checkered: Requires bb (pigment) and CC (pattern)\n  Genotype: bb CC, bb Cc\n  Number: 2\n  Probability: 2/16 = 1/8\n\n- Brown Plain: Requires bb (pigment) and cc (pattern)\n  Genotype: bb cc\n  Number: 1\n  Probability: 1/16\n\nWait, no. Brown Plain requires both bb (pigment) and cc (pattern). So only one genotype: bb cc.\n\nSimilarly, Brown Checkered requires bb (pigment) and at least one C (pattern). So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- bb CC\n- bb Cc\n\nWhich are two types.\n\nSo their probabilities sum to 2/16 = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, Red Checkered is four types: BB CC, BB Cc, Bb CC, Bb Cc. So four cases.\n\nRed Brown is two types: BB cc, Bb cc. Two cases.\n\nSo now, let's map the phenotypes and their counts:\n\nPhenotype | Cases | Count\n---|---|---\nRed Checkered | 4 | 4\nRed Brown | 2 | 2\nBrown Checkered | 2 | 2\nBrown Plain | 1 | 1\nTotal | 9 | 16\n\nWait, but according to our previous calculation, the total cases should add up to 16.\n\nWait, no, according to the above table, the sum is 4+2+2+1=9, which is less than 16. That suggests an error in my counting.\n\nAh, I see. I forgot that for some genotypes, the pattern may vary. Let's recount correctly.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red Checkered** (BB CC, BB Cc, Bb CC, Bb Cc",

    "rollout": " Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nWe have two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means it has the genotype CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown bird with the genotype cc bb. They are having an adhybrid cross because the parents are both heterozygous. Wait, no\u2014actually, the first parent is homozygous (CC BB), so when they mate, all their offspring will be from that parent, but wait, no\u2014the second parent is also heterozygous for both genes, right? So actually, the cross should involve a dihybrid between CC BB and cc bb. \n\nSo the question asks about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after completing the Punnett square. But before that, let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. The first parent is CC BB, meaning they're homozygous for both dominant traits. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both traits. Wait, no\u2014that would mean that if you cross them, all the F1 would be Cc Bb. But in this case, since the first parent is homozygous, does that change anything? Maybe not, because the first parent can't produce any different gametes than itself. So perhaps the F1 would all be Cc Bb, and then F2 would come from that cross.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned a checkered pattern controlled by gene C, so maybe the alleles at C determine the pattern. And the color determination is influenced by another gene, B, with B as dominant and b as recessive. So the first parent is CC BB, which would express both dominant traits, leading to checkered red, assuming that the pattern is expressed when both C and B are present. Similarly, the second parent is cc bb, which would lead to plain brown, since c is recessive for both traits.\n\nNow, we need to consider an adhybrid cross between these two parents. Adhybrid means we're considering both dominant and recessive alleles. However, wait\u2014it might be more accurate to think that the parents themselves are the ones providing gametes, but since the first parent is homozygous, its gametes will all be the same. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try again. The cross is between CC BB and cc bb. Since CC BB can only produce CB gametes, and cc bb can only produce cb gametes, the F1 will all be Cc Bb. Then, the F1 will self-fertilize to get F2. Alternatively, if the cross is between two F1 individuals, each F1 would be Cc Bb, so their gametes would be CB, Cb, cB, cb. That makes sense.\n\nBut the question says \"complete a Punnett square for an adhybrid cross.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"adhybrid.\" Perhaps it refers to considering both dominant and recessive alleles for both genes, like looking at the cross between CC BB and cc bb, which would result in F1 being Cc Bb, and then F2 based on that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Let's clarify:\n\n- Homozygous checkered red bird: CC BB \u2192 leads to checkered red phenotype.\n- Plain brown bird: cc bb \u2192 leads to plain brown phenotype.\n- Genes involved: C (dominant = checkered, recessive = plain), B (dominant = red, recessive = brown).\n- The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).\n\nSince the first parent is homozygous, all its gametes will carry the same allele combination. So the F1 will all be Cc Bb. Then, F1s self-pollinate to get F2.\n\nBut the question mentions an adhybrid cross, which typically involves both dominant and recessive alleles. However, in this case, the parents are homozygous, so the F1 would all be Cc Bb. Thus, the F2 would consist of all possible combinations of Cc Bb gametes. So the F2 would be Cc Bb crossed with Cc Bb.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't seem to include that. Instead, the options mention checking red vs brown and plain vs checkered, etc., so perhaps I need to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial cross was between two F1 birds, resulting in F2. But given the confusion, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the parents are CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). Their F1 will be Cc Bb (since each gene is independent). Then, F1 self-pollinates to get F2.\n\nThe possible gametes for F1 (Cc Bb) are:\n- Cc Bb (from the C locus)\n- Cc Bb (from the B locus)\n\nWait, no. Actually, each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus, the parents are CC and cc, but wait, the F1 is Cc Bb, so each gamete would be either C or c for C, and B or b for B.\n\nThus, the F1 gametes are:\n- C B\n- C b\n- c B\n- c b\n\nEach with equal probability. When F1 (Cc Bb) self-mates, the F2 will have four combinations for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C + C \u2192 CC\n- C + c \u2192 Cc\n- c + C \u2192 Cc\n- c + c \u2192 cc\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- B + B \u2192 BB\n- B + b \u2192 Bb\n- b + B \u2192 Bb\n- b + b \u2192 bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations of CC, Cc, cc for the C locus, and BB, Bb, bb for the B locus. This gives us 3 x 3 = 9 possible genotypic classes.\n\nNow, we need to map these to phenotypes. Each bird has two traits: checkered (C) and color (B). The presence of both C and B results in checkered red. The presence of C but not B results in checkered brown. The presence of c (recessive for C) and B results in plain red, and c and b result in plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of alleles at both loci.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each genotype in F2:\n\nTotal F2 = 9 birds.\n\nGenotype counts:\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 2 (from Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb)\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 2 (from Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc BB)\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- Cc bb: 2\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 2\n- cc bb: 1\n\nWait, actually, when squaring a 3x3 grid, the counts are as follows:\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 2\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 2\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- Cc bb: 2\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 2\n- cc bb: 1\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: requires both C and B. So CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n- Checkered brown: requires C but not B. CC bb, Cc bb.\n- Plain red: requires c (recessive C) and B. cc BB, cc Bb.\n- Plain brown: requires c and not B. cc bb.\n\nCounting each:\n\nCheckered red: 1 (CC BB) + 2 (CC Bb) + 2 (Cc BB) + 4 (Cc Bb) = 9? Wait, no, wait. Wait, CC BB is 1, CC Bb is 2, Cc BB is 2, Cc Bb is 4. Adding those together: 1+2=3, +2=5, +4=9. But total F2 is 9 birds, so 9 / 9 = 100% checkered red. That can\u2019t be right because the options suggest variation among the phenotypes.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake. Let me recount properly.\n\nActually, the correct way is to list each genotype and its corresponding phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown\n- CC bb: Plain brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Plain brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nNow, counting how many of each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (4). Total: 1+2+2+4=9.\n\nWait, that's still 9, which doesn't add up to 9. There's something wrong here.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. Each bird is determined by both alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (phenotype)\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown (phenotype)\n- CC bb: Plain brown (phenotype)\n- Cc BB: Checkered red (phenotype)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red (phenotype)\n- Cc bb: Plain brown (phenotype)\n- cc BB: Plain red (phenotype)\n- cc Bb: Plain red (phenotype)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (phenotype)\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (4). Total: 1+2=3, +2=5, +4=9.\n\nWait, that's impossible because there are only 9 birds. So where am I going wrong?\n\nAh, I see. The counts for each genotype are:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 2\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 2\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- Cc bb: 2\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 2\n- cc bb: 1\n\nTotal: 1+2+1+2+4+2+1+2+1 = 16? Wait, no, that can't be right because each parent produces four gametes, so F2 should be 16 birds. But the original cross is between two birds, each producing four gametes, so the F2 is 16.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me approach it differently. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, the F1 will be Cc Bb. Then, F1 self-pairs to give F2.\n\nIn F2, each gene segregates independently, so the possible combinations are:\n\nFor C: CC, Cc, cc\nFor B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of these, giving 3x3=9 genotypic classes.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Checkered brown: C but not B (CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain red: c but not B (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: neither (cc bb)\n\nCounting each:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (4). Total: 1+2+2+4=9.\n\nBut wait, that's 9 out of 16, which seems high. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, no, because each parent contributes four gametes, so F1 is Cc Bb, which when crossed again:\n\nEach gamete from F1 (Cc Bb) combines with another gamete. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C: C can be C or c (each with 50% chance)\nFor B: B can be B or b (each with 50% chance)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nCC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb,\n\nCC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb,\n\ncc bb.\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown\n- CC bb: Plain brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Plain brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nNow, counting:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (4). Total: 1+2+2+4=9.\n\nCheckered brown: CC bb (1), Cc bb (2). Total: 3.\n\nPlain red: cc BB (1), cc Bb (2). Total: 3.\n\nPlain brown: CC bb (1) + Cc Bb (4) + cc bb (1)? Wait, no. Wait, CC bb is 1, Cc Bb is 4, cc bb is 1. So total plain brown: 1+4+1=6.\n\nWait, that adds up: 9 (red) + 3 (brown) + 3 (red) + 6 (brown) = 21, which is too much because there are only 16 birds. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Each F2 individual has two traits, so 16 birds in total. Let's recompute:\n\nCheckered red: 1 (CC BB) + 2 (CC Bb) + 2 (Cc BB) + 4 (Cc Bb) = 9.\n\nCheckered brown: 1 (CC bb) + 2 (Cc bb) = 3.\n\nPlain red: 1 (cc BB) + 2 (cc Bb) = 3.\n\nPlain brown: 1 (CC bb) + 2 (Cc Bb) + 1 (cc bb) = 4.\n\nWait, that sums to 9+3+3+4=19, which is still off. Something's wrong here.\n\nWait, no. Let me use the actual counts from the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb: 2 birds \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb: 1 bird \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc BB: 2 birds \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: 4 birds \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc bb: 2 birds \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc BB: 1 bird \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb: 2 birds \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: 1 bird \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 16 birds.\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9\n- Checkered brown: 2 + 2 = 4 (Wait, no, CC Bb is 2, Cc Bb is 4, totaling 6.)\nWait, no, CC Bb is 2, Cc Bb is 4, and CC bb is 1. So CC Bb (2) + Cc Bb (4) + CC bb (1) = 7.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's list each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: birds 1,4,5 \u2192 3\nCheckered brown: bird 2 \u2192 1\nPlain red: birds 7,8 \u2192 2\nPlain brown: birds 3,6,9 \u2192 3\n\nWait, that totals 3+1+2+3=9, which matches our earlier count.\n\nWait, but according to this, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nCheckered red: 3\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain red: 2\nPlain brown: 3\n\nWhich adds up to 9 birds, but that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought there were 9 checkered reds. Clearly, I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, but according to the actual breakdown above, the correct counts are:\n\nCheckered red: 3\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain red: 2\nPlain brown: 3\n\nBut none of the answer choices match exactly. The closest option is D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 cross instead of the F2, but that wouldn't make sense because the first parent is homozygous.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant a dihybrid cross between two F1 birds, each being Cc BB and cc bb. Let me try that.\n\nIf the cross is between a Cc BB (which is C B) and a cc bb (which is c b), then the F1 would be Cc Bb for each trait, and the F2 would be:\n\nFor C: C (from Cc) and c (from cc)\nFor B: B (from Cc) and b (from bb)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be all combinations:\n\nCC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb,\nCC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb,\ncc bb.\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to the same phenotypic ratios.\n\nSo, back to the original question: the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation is supposed to be one of the options A through J. From my calculations, the correct ratio is:\n\nCheckered red: 3\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain red: 2\nPlain brown: 3\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No, doesn't match.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Check",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nWe have two birds crossing: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means it has the genotype CC BB. The other bird is a plain brown bird with the genotype cc bb. They are having an adhybrid cross because the parents are both heterozygous. Wait, no\u2014actually, the first parent is homozygous (CC BB), so when they mate, all their offspring will be from that parent, but wait, no\u2014the second parent is also heterozygous for both genes, right? So actually, the cross should involve a dihybrid between CC BB and cc bb. \n\nSo the question asks about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after completing the Punnett square. But before that, let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. The first parent is CC BB, meaning they're homozygous for both dominant traits. The second parent is cc bb, which is homozygous recessive for both traits. Wait, no\u2014that would mean that if you cross them, all the F1 would be Cc Bb. But in this case, since the first parent is homozygous, does that change anything? Maybe not, because the first parent can't produce any different gametes than itself. So perhaps the F1 would all be Cc Bb, and then F2 would come from that cross.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned a checkered pattern controlled by gene C, so maybe the alleles at C determine the pattern. And the color determination is influenced by another gene, B, with B as dominant and b as recessive. So the first parent is CC BB, which would express both dominant traits, leading to checkered red, assuming that the pattern is expressed when both C and B are present. Similarly, the second parent is cc bb, which would lead to plain brown, since c is recessive for both traits.\n\nNow, we need to consider an adhybrid cross between these two parents. Adhybrid means we're considering both dominant and recessive alleles. However, wait\u2014it might be more accurate to think that the parents themselves are the ones providing gametes, but since the first parent is homozygous, its gametes will all be the same. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try again. The cross is between CC BB and cc bb. Since CC BB can only produce CB gametes, and cc bb can only produce cb gametes, the F1 will all be Cc Bb. Then, the F1 will self-fertilize to get F2. Alternatively, if the cross is between two F1 individuals, each F1 would be Cc Bb, so their gametes would be CB, Cb, cB, cb. That makes sense.\n\nBut the question says \"complete a Punnett square for an adhybrid cross.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"adhybrid.\" Perhaps it refers to considering both dominant and recessive alleles for both genes, like looking at the cross between CC BB and cc bb, which would result in F1 being Cc Bb, and then F2 based on that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Let's clarify:\n\n- Homozygous checkered red bird: CC BB \u2192 leads to checkered red phenotype.\n- Plain brown bird: cc bb \u2192 leads to plain brown phenotype.\n- Genes involved: C (dominant = checkered, recessive = plain), B (dominant = red, recessive = brown).\n- The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).\n\nSince the first parent is homozygous, all its gametes will carry the same allele combination. So the F1 will all be Cc Bb. Then, F1s self-pollinate to get F2.\n\nBut the question mentions an adhybrid cross, which typically involves both dominant and recessive alleles. However, in this case, the parents are homozygous, so the F1 would all be Cc Bb. Thus, the F2 would consist of all possible combinations of Cc Bb gametes. So the F2 would be Cc Bb crossed with Cc Bb.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't seem to include that. Instead, the options mention checking red vs brown and plain vs checkered, etc., so perhaps I need to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial cross was between two F1 birds, resulting in F2. But given the confusion, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the parents are CC BB (checkered red) and cc bb (plain brown). Their F1 will be Cc Bb (since each gene is independent). Then, F1 self-pollinates to get F2.\n\nThe possible gametes for F1 (Cc Bb) are:\n- Cc Bb (from the C locus)\n- Cc Bb (from the B locus)\n\nWait, no. Actually, each gene segregates independently. So for the C locus, the parents are CC and cc, but wait, the F1 is Cc Bb, so each gamete would be either C or c for C, and B or b for B.\n\nThus, the F1 gametes are:\n- C B\n- C b\n- c B\n- c b\n\nEach with equal probability. When F1 (Cc Bb) self-mates, the F2 will have four combinations for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C + C \u2192 CC\n- C + c \u2192 Cc\n- c + C \u2192 Cc\n- c + c \u2192 cc\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- B + B \u2192 BB\n- B + b \u2192 Bb\n- b + B \u2192 Bb\n- b + b \u2192 bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations of CC, Cc, cc for the C locus, and BB, Bb, bb for the B locus. This gives us 3 x 3 = 9 possible genotypic classes.\n\nNow, we need to map these to phenotypes. Each bird has two traits: checkered (C) and color (B). The presence of both C and B results in checkered red. The presence of C but not B results in checkered brown. The presence of c (recessive for C) and B results in plain red, and c and b result in plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of alleles at both loci.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each genotype in F2:\n\nTotal F2 = 9 birds.\n\nGenotype counts:\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 2 (from Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb)\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 2 (from Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc BB)\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- Cc bb: 2\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 2\n- cc bb: 1\n\nWait, actually, when squaring a 3x3 grid, the counts are as follows:\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 2\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 2\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- Cc bb: 2\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 2\n- cc bb: 1\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: requires both C and B. So CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n- Checkered brown: requires C but not B. CC bb, Cc bb.\n- Plain red: requires c (recessive C) and B. cc BB, cc Bb.\n- Plain brown: requires c and not B. cc bb.\n\nCounting each:\n\nCheckered red: 1 (CC BB) + 2 (CC Bb) + 2 (Cc BB) + 4 (Cc Bb) = 9? Wait, no, wait. Wait, CC BB is 1, CC Bb is 2, Cc BB is 2, Cc Bb is 4. Adding those together: 1+2=3, +2=5, +4=9. But total F2 is 9 birds, so 9 / 9 = 100% checkered red. That can\u2019t be right because the options suggest variation among the phenotypes.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake. Let me recount properly.\n\nActually, the correct way is to list each genotype and its corresponding phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown\n- CC bb: Plain brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Plain brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nNow, counting how many of each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (4). Total: 1+2+2+4=9.\n\nWait, that's still 9, which doesn't add up to 9. There's something wrong here.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. Each bird is determined by both alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (phenotype)\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown (phenotype)\n- CC bb: Plain brown (phenotype)\n- Cc BB: Checkered red (phenotype)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red (phenotype)\n- Cc bb: Plain brown (phenotype)\n- cc BB: Plain red (phenotype)\n- cc Bb: Plain red (phenotype)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (phenotype)\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (4). Total: 1+2=3, +2=5, +4=9.\n\nWait, that's impossible because there are only 9 birds. So where am I going wrong?\n\nAh, I see. The counts for each genotype are:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 2\n- CC bb: 1\n- Cc BB: 2\n- Cc Bb: 4\n- Cc bb: 2\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 2\n- cc bb: 1\n\nTotal: 1+2+1+2+4+2+1+2+1 = 16? Wait, no, that can't be right because each parent produces four gametes, so F2 should be 16 birds. But the original cross is between two birds, each producing four gametes, so the F2 is 16.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me approach it differently. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. When crossed, the F1 will be Cc Bb. Then, F1 self-pairs to give F2.\n\nIn F2, each gene segregates independently, so the possible combinations are:\n\nFor C: CC, Cc, cc\nFor B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of these, giving 3x3=9 genotypic classes.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on whether each gene is dominant or recessive:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Checkered brown: C but not B (CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain red: c but not B (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: neither (cc bb)\n\nCounting each:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (4). Total: 1+2+2+4=9.\n\nBut wait, that's 9 out of 16, which seems high. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, no, because each parent contributes four gametes, so F1 is Cc Bb, which when crossed again:\n\nEach gamete from F1 (Cc Bb) combines with another gamete. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C: C can be C or c (each with 50% chance)\nFor B: B can be B or b (each with 50% chance)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nCC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb,\n\nCC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb,\n\ncc bb.\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown\n- CC bb: Plain brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc bb: Plain brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nNow, counting:\n\nCheckered red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (4). Total: 1+2+2+4=9.\n\nCheckered brown: CC bb (1), Cc bb (2). Total: 3.\n\nPlain red: cc BB (1), cc Bb (2). Total: 3.\n\nPlain brown: CC bb (1) + Cc Bb (4) + cc bb (1)? Wait, no. Wait, CC bb is 1, Cc Bb is 4, cc bb is 1. So total plain brown: 1+4+1=6.\n\nWait, that adds up: 9 (red) + 3 (brown) + 3 (red) + 6 (brown) = 21, which is too much because there are only 16 birds. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Each F2 individual has two traits, so 16 birds in total. Let's recompute:\n\nCheckered red: 1 (CC BB) + 2 (CC Bb) + 2 (Cc BB) + 4 (Cc Bb) = 9.\n\nCheckered brown: 1 (CC bb) + 2 (Cc bb) = 3.\n\nPlain red: 1 (cc BB) + 2 (cc Bb) = 3.\n\nPlain brown: 1 (CC bb) + 2 (Cc Bb) + 1 (cc bb) = 4.\n\nWait, that sums to 9+3+3+4=19, which is still off. Something's wrong here.\n\nWait, no. Let me use the actual counts from the Punnett square:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb: 2 birds \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb: 1 bird \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc BB: 2 birds \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: 4 birds \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc bb: 2 birds \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc BB: 1 bird \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb: 2 birds \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: 1 bird \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 16 birds.\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9\n- Checkered brown: 2 + 2 = 4 (Wait, no, CC Bb is 2, Cc Bb is 4, totaling 6.)\nWait, no, CC Bb is 2, Cc Bb is 4, and CC bb is 1. So CC Bb (2) + Cc Bb (4) + CC bb (1) = 7.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's list each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: birds 1,4,5 \u2192 3\nCheckered brown: bird 2 \u2192 1\nPlain red: birds 7,8 \u2192 2\nPlain brown: birds 3,6,9 \u2192 3\n\nWait, that totals 3+1+2+3=9, which matches our earlier count.\n\nWait, but according to this, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nCheckered red: 3\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain red: 2\nPlain brown: 3\n\nWhich adds up to 9 birds, but that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought there were 9 checkered reds. Clearly, I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, but according to the actual breakdown above, the correct counts are:\n\nCheckered red: 3\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain red: 2\nPlain brown: 3\n\nBut none of the answer choices match exactly. The closest option is D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 cross instead of the F2, but that wouldn't make sense because the first parent is homozygous.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant a dihybrid cross between two F1 birds, each being Cc BB and cc bb. Let me try that.\n\nIf the cross is between a Cc BB (which is C B) and a cc bb (which is c b), then the F1 would be Cc Bb for each trait, and the F2 would be:\n\nFor C: C (from Cc) and c (from cc)\nFor B: B (from Cc) and b (from bb)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be all combinations:\n\nCC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb,\nCC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb,\ncc bb.\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to the same phenotypic ratios.\n\nSo, back to the original question: the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation is supposed to be one of the options A through J. From my calculations, the correct ratio is:\n\nCheckered red: 3\nCheckered brown: 1\nPlain red: 2\nPlain brown: 3\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption B: Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No, doesn't match.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Check",

    "rollout": " Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). We need to find the Punnett square for an adihybridcross between them. Wait, adihybrid means dihybrid, right? So they're crossing two traits at once.\n\nThe parents' genotypes are:\n- CC BB: Checkered red because both C and B are dominant.\n- cc bb: Plain brown because both c and b are recessive.\n\nSince they're doing a dihybrid cross, we'll have four possible combinations in the F1 generation. Each parent contributes two gametes: CC/BB, CC/bb, cc/BB, and cc/bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 will be the combination of these gametes. But wait, let me think again. Actually, each parent's gametes would be half dominant and half recessive. So for CC/BB, each gamete has CB or something? Hmm, maybe I should consider all possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible gametes from each parent first. For CCBB, the gametes can only be CB since both alleles are dominant. For ccbb, the gametes can only be cb because both alleles are recessive. So when they cross:\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 gametes: CB\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 gametes: cb\n\nSo the F1 will be CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nBut wait, the question says to make a Punnett square for the F2 generation. So after F1, which is CcBb, we cross that with itself. That makes sense because the question asks about the F2 generation.\n\nNow, let's construct the Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nEach parent contributes two gametes. The possible gametes are:\n\nFrom Cc: C (dominant) or c (recessive)\nFrom Bb: B (dominant) or b (recessive)\n\nSo the gametes will combine as CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nPutting it together, the F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\nCC (from C x C), Cc (from C x c), cc (from c x c),\nBB (from B x B), Bb (from B x b), bb (from b x b).\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the combination of C and B. Since C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, the phenotype will be determined by whether the individual has at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nLet's map the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\n- CCBB: Checkered red (both dominant)\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown (C dominant, B is dominant due to being heterozygous)\n- CC bb: Checkered brown (only C dominant, b recessive)\n- CC bb is actually already covered under CCb_, but since both are present, it's brown.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- CcBB: Heterozygous dominant for both, so brown\n- Cc Bb: Heterozygous for both, brown\n- Cc bb: Heterozygous for C, but b is recessive, so brown\n- ccBB: Plain red (since only b is recessive)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (only b is recessive)\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, but some might confuse if they're considering dominance correctly. Let me clarify:\n\nFor the presence of dominant alleles, any presence of at least one dominant allele will result in the dominant phenotype. So for example, if you have at least one C and at least one B, you get the checkered red phenotype. If you have at least one C but not B, you get checkered brown. Similarly, if you have at least one B but not C, you get plain brown. And if neither C nor B is present, you get plain red.\n\nSo the correct phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered red (CCBB, CC Bb, CC bb)\nCheckered brown (CcBB, Cc Bb, cB BB, cB Bb, etc.)\nPlain brown (ccBB, cc Bb, cc bb)\nPlain red (none, all recessives)\n\nWait, but in reality, some people might think differently. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\nIf the individual has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it's checkered. If only one dominant allele is present, it's brown. Only recessive (no dominant) is red.\n\nSo:\n\n- Any presence of C and B \u2192 checkered red\n- Any presence of C but not B \u2192 checkered brown\n- Any presence of B but not C \u2192 plain brown\n- Neither C nor B \u2192 plain red\n\nThat seems accurate.\n\nNow, to determine the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can look at the possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (like F2 from F1), the probability distribution is as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: (1/4)(1/4) * 4 = 1/4 (because there are four possible combinations that result in both dominant alleles)\nWait, no. Actually, the number of checkered red in F2 is 9/16 (since 3^2=9 squares where both C and B are dominant).\nSimilarly,\n- Checkered brown: 3/8 (because 3 squares where C is present but B isn't)\n- Plain brown: 3/8 (where B is present but C isn't)\n- Plain red: 1/16 (where neither C nor B is present)\n\nWait, but I think I'm confusing the actual probabilities here. Let me calculate properly.\n\nThe total number of F2 individuals is 16.\n\n- Checkered red: occurs when both C and B are present (C_ B_), which happens in 3x3=9 cases, so 9/16.\n- Checkered brown: occurs when C is present but B is absent (C B b _), which is 3x1=3, so 3/16.\n- Plain brown: occurs when B is present but C is absent (C _ B b), also 3/16.\n- Plain red: when neither C nor B is present (c c), so 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red : checkered brown : plain brown : plain red.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is different.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's 1:3:9:3, which matches a different ratio, perhaps for a trihybrid?\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3, same as option D reversed.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1, which is what we calculated.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). We need to find the Punnett square for an adihybridcross between them. Wait, adihybrid means dihybrid, right? So they're crossing two traits at once.\n\nThe parents' genotypes are:\n- CC BB: Checkered red because both C and B are dominant.\n- cc bb: Plain brown because both c and b are recessive.\n\nSince they're doing a dihybrid cross, we'll have four possible combinations in the F1 generation. Each parent contributes two gametes: CC/BB, CC/bb, cc/BB, and cc/bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 will be the combination of these gametes. But wait, let me think again. Actually, each parent's gametes would be half dominant and half recessive. So for CC/BB, each gamete has CB or something? Hmm, maybe I should consider all possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible gametes from each parent first. For CCBB, the gametes can only be CB since both alleles are dominant. For ccbb, the gametes can only be cb because both alleles are recessive. So when they cross:\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 gametes: CB\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 gametes: cb\n\nSo the F1 will be CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb.\n\nBut wait, the question says to make a Punnett square for the F2 generation. So after F1, which is CcBb, we cross that with itself. That makes sense because the question asks about the F2 generation.\n\nNow, let's construct the Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nEach parent contributes two gametes. The possible gametes are:\n\nFrom Cc: C (dominant) or c (recessive)\nFrom Bb: B (dominant) or b (recessive)\n\nSo the gametes will combine as CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nPutting it together, the F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\nCC (from C x C), Cc (from C x c), cc (from c x c),\nBB (from B x B), Bb (from B x b), bb (from b x b).\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the combination of C and B. Since C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, the phenotype will be determined by whether the individual has at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nLet's map the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\n- CCBB: Checkered red (both dominant)\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown (C dominant, B is dominant due to being heterozygous)\n- CC bb: Checkered brown (only C dominant, b recessive)\n- CC bb is actually already covered under CCb_, but since both are present, it's brown.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- CcBB: Heterozygous dominant for both, so brown\n- Cc Bb: Heterozygous for both, brown\n- Cc bb: Heterozygous for C, but b is recessive, so brown\n- ccBB: Plain red (since only b is recessive)\n- cc Bb: Plain brown (only b is recessive)\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, but some might confuse if they're considering dominance correctly. Let me clarify:\n\nFor the presence of dominant alleles, any presence of at least one dominant allele will result in the dominant phenotype. So for example, if you have at least one C and at least one B, you get the checkered red phenotype. If you have at least one C but not B, you get checkered brown. Similarly, if you have at least one B but not C, you get plain brown. And if neither C nor B is present, you get plain red.\n\nSo the correct phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered red (CCBB, CC Bb, CC bb)\nCheckered brown (CcBB, Cc Bb, cB BB, cB Bb, etc.)\nPlain brown (ccBB, cc Bb, cc bb)\nPlain red (none, all recessives)\n\nWait, but in reality, some people might think differently. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\nIf the individual has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it's checkered. If only one dominant allele is present, it's brown. Only recessive (no dominant) is red.\n\nSo:\n\n- Any presence of C and B \u2192 checkered red\n- Any presence of C but not B \u2192 checkered brown\n- Any presence of B but not C \u2192 plain brown\n- Neither C nor B \u2192 plain red\n\nThat seems accurate.\n\nNow, to determine the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can look at the possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (like F2 from F1), the probability distribution is as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: (1/4)(1/4) * 4 = 1/4 (because there are four possible combinations that result in both dominant alleles)\nWait, no. Actually, the number of checkered red in F2 is 9/16 (since 3^2=9 squares where both C and B are dominant).\nSimilarly,\n- Checkered brown: 3/8 (because 3 squares where C is present but B isn't)\n- Plain brown: 3/8 (where B is present but C isn't)\n- Plain red: 1/16 (where neither C nor B is present)\n\nWait, but I think I'm confusing the actual probabilities here. Let me calculate properly.\n\nThe total number of F2 individuals is 16.\n\n- Checkered red: occurs when both C and B are present (C_ B_), which happens in 3x3=9 cases, so 9/16.\n- Checkered brown: occurs when C is present but B is absent (C B b _), which is 3x1=3, so 3/16.\n- Plain brown: occurs when B is present but C is absent (C _ B b), also 3/16.\n- Plain red: when neither C nor B is present (c c), so 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red : checkered brown : plain brown : plain red.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is different.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's 1:3:9:3, which matches a different ratio, perhaps for a trihybrid?\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3, same as option D reversed.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1, which is what we calculated.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

One bird is a homozygous checkered red parent (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown parent (ccbb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio of their offspring in the F2 generation. The options provided are A through J, each giving different ratios.\n\nFirst, I should break down the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CCBB. Since it's homozygous, both alleles are C and B. C is the dominant for pigmentation, so having at least one C means they're checkered. B is the dominant for red color, so if there's at least one B, they're red. So CCBB would be checkered red.\n\nThe second parent is ccbb. This is homozygous as well, but both alleles are c and b. c is recessive for pigment, meaning no pigment unless there's a dominant allele. Similarly, b is recessive for brown, which isn't expressed unless there's a dominant allele. So ccbb would be plain brown because neither c nor b is present in any dominant form.\n\nNow, we're looking at an F2 generation, which comes from crossing F1 plants. But wait, actually, when you cross a homozygous recessive (like ccbb) with a heterozygote (like CcBB), the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, when you cross F1 individuals among themselves, that's where the Punnett square comes into play.\n\nSo, let's construct the Punnett square for CcBb x CcBb. Each gamete from the first bird has a 50% chance of being CB or cb, and each gamete from the second bird also has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. However, since both parents are CcBb, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB x cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb x CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb x cb \u2192 c c b b \u2192 cc BB (but wait, bb is brown, right? Because b is recessive for brown.)\n\nWait, correction: the letters represent alleles on homologous chromosomes. So, the notation CcBB means one C and one c, and two B's. Wait, but the original notation might not follow standard notation. Typically, it's written as two pairs, like CcBB would mean for example, for one pair, C and c, and another pair B and B. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nActually, in the context given, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, CCBB would mean both alleles are C (pigment) and B (red). And ccbb would mean both alleles are c (no pigment) and b (brown).\n\nSo, each bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no, more accurately, each bird can produce gametes CB, cB, CB, etc., but considering dominance, the actual gametes produced would depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nBut for simplicity, assuming all gametes are equally likely, regardless of dominance, maybe. Alternatively, since the parents are homozygous, the F1 would all be CcBb, meaning each gamete would have a 50% chance of carrying either C or c, and a 50% chance of carrying either B or b.\n\nTherefore, when creating the Punnett square, each parent contributes two types of gametes: C/c and B/b. So, each gamete is a combination of these. For example, the first bird could give a gamete of CB, cB, BC, or cb, but typically, without considering dominance, all gametes are considered possible. However, since the parents are homozygous, the actual gametes may vary based on dominance, but often, when making Punnett squares for such problems, all gametes are assumed to carry the alleles independently.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the Punnett square is constructed as follows: each allele is inherited independently, so for each gene, the gamete has a certain probability of contributing each allele.\n\nIn this case, for Gene C: Parent is CC, so all gametes are C.\nFor Gene B: Parent is BB, so all gametes are B.\n\nThus, the F1 from CC x cc would be Cc, and the F1 from BB x bb would be Bb. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, when F1 (CcBb) self-fertilizes, each gene is independent. So, for gene C, the F1 produces gametes C and c with equal probability. Similarly, for gene B, the F1 produces gametes B and b with equal probability.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes would be Cc x Bb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles:\n- For Pigmentation (C): If C is present (any C), then checkered.\n- For Color (B): If B is present (any B), then red.\n\nSo, combining these:\n- Checkered Red: Both C and B present \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\n- Checkered Brown: C present, b present \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered brown\n- Plain Red: c present, B absent \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain red\n- Plain Brown: c present, b present \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the counts:\nEach gene segregates independently, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for CcBb : Ccbb : ccBb : ccbb.\n\nTotal parts = 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nSo:\n- Checkered Red: 9/16 of total \u2192 9\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain Red: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain Brown: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option G says: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". No.\n\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". That seems close but inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the proportion. Let me double-check.\n\nIf the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, that sums to 16. So each phenotype would be proportional to these numbers.\n\nCheckered Red: 9 \u2192 Checkered Brown: 3 \u2192 Plain Red: 3 \u2192 Plain Brown: 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match exactly. Option G is checkered red 12, which is higher than 9. Option D has checkered red 1, which is too low.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Perhaps the initial assumption about the parents was wrong.\n\nWait, the first parent is CCBB. If the notation is per chromosome, then it's two pairs: C/C and B/B. So, the F1 would be Cc and Bb. Then, the F1s self-fertilize, resulting in Cc x Bb, leading to 9:3:3:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the notation is different, and the parents are CC (for pigment) and BB (for color), so CcBb.\n\nBut according to the options, the correct answer must be among them. Let me look again.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0. That\u2019s 16 total. How does that come?\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the total number of offspring. But in reality, the F2 generation in a dihybrid cross is 9+3+3+1=16, but when counting specific phenotypes, they sum differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the options count the total number of offspring, not the specific phenotypes. But the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, the options list the counts for each phenotype, e.g., checkered red 6, etc. Based on my earlier calculation, checkered red is 9, which isn't listed in any option except perhaps none. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, brown 9, plain red 1, brown 3. That adds up to 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nIf the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, then:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Plain Red: 3\n- Plain Brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 16 total, but the distribution is off.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, brown 3, plain red 9, brown 3 \u2192 Again, incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Maybe checkered red requires both C and B alleles, whereas plain red requires both c and b. Similarly, checkered brown needs C and b, while plain brown needs c and B.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- CCBB: Checkered Red\n- CcBB: Checkered Brown\n- CCbb: Plain Red\n- Ccbb: Plain Brown\n\nWhen F1 is crossed with F1, the F2 would result in the following:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so:\n\nFor C: 9 (CC), 3 (Cc), 3 (Cc), 1 (cc)\nFor B: same as C.\n\nThus, the combined F2 would be:\n\n- CC x CC \u2192 CC (Checkered Red)\n- CC x Cc \u2192 Cc (Checkered Brown)\n- CC x cc \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n- Cc x CC \u2192 Cc (Checkered Brown)\n- Cc x Cc \u2192 Cc (Checkered Brown)\n- Cc x cc \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n- cc x CC \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n- cc x Cc \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n- cc x cc \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n\nWait, that approach might not be accurate. Instead, using the Punnett square method:\n\nF1 for C: Cc (since CC x cc gives Cc)\nSame for B: Bb (from BB x bb)\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) self-pollinates, the F2 would be Cc x Bb.\n\nThe phenotypes would be based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered Red: C and B present \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n- Checkered Brown: C present, b absent \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Plain Red: c present, B absent \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Red\n- Plain Brown: c present, b present \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nThus, the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to match this exact distribution. However, option G says checkered red 12, which is higher than 9. Option D has checkered red 1, which is lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the total number of offspring rather than the specific phenotypes. But the question specifies phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. If the first parent is CC (picturated as checkered red) and the second is BB (picturated as plain brown), then the F1 would be CcBB, and the F2 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven the options, none exactly match this, but option G is the closest with 12, 2, 2, 0, which sums to 16. It suggests a different ratio, possibly due to different segregation probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC (checkered red) and cc (plain brown), but that doesn't make sense because cc would be pure brown, but in the question, the second parent is plain brown (ccbb), so that's correct.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem considers all possibilities, including lethals, but the question doesn't mention anything like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to consider only the phenotypic outcomes without accounting for genetic ratios correctly. Alternatively, maybe the question counts the total number of birds instead of the specific phenotypes. But the question clearly states \"phenotypic ratio.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is none of the above, but since the options are provided, I'll have to choose the closest. Option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the notation.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation uses each allele separately, not as a pair. For example, CCBB could be represented as two separate traits: C (pigment) and B (color). In that case, the F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (color). Thus, F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, the F2 would be Cc x Bb, leading to the same 9:3:3:1 ratio. Still, the options don't match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the total number of offspring regardless of phenotype. But the question asks for phenotypic ratio, so that's not applicable.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue lies in how the problem defines the F2 generation. The F2 generation refers to the second generation after F1 selfing, which would indeed be 9:3:3:1.\n\nSince none of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1, but option E lists 3,9,1,3, which is 16 total, but the breakdown is 3 Checkered Red, 9 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown. That doesn't align with our expectation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial parents were incorrectly interpreted. If the parents were CC (checkered red) and bb (plain brown), then the F1 would be Cc (checkered) and bb (plain). Then, the F2 would be Cc x bb, leading to 1:1:1:1. But that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC (checkered red) and bb (plain brown), so F1 would be Cc (checkered) and bb (plain). Then, F2 would be Cc x bb, which would result in Cc (checkered) and bb (plain), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are CC (checkered red) and Bb (pure brown?), that wouldn't fit the description.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CCBB, which could be CC (pigment) and BB (color), making it checkered red. The second parent is ccbb, which is cc (no pigment) and bb (brown), making it plain brown. So, F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (color), so CcBb.\n\nThen, F2 would be Cc x Bb, resulting in 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly. However, option G mentions 12, 2, 2, 0, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the question intended to use a different approach, such as considering the presence of dominant alleles without considering the order. For instance, in F2, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both C and B: Checkered Red\n- C and b: Checkered Brown\n- c and B: Plain Red\n- c and b: Plain Brown\n\nWith counts 9,3,3,1 respectively.\n\nLooking at the options again, none directly match. However, option D mentions checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our 9:3:3:1 but inverted. So, perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the entire population, not just the F2 generation. If that's the case, the total number of birds would be 16, but the breakdown depends on the phenotypes.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would still be 9:3:3:1, but the total number would be 16. However, the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance rules and consider all alleles present, leading to different ratios. But that's against standard genetics principles.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options exactly match this, perhaps the intended answer is option G, even though it doesn't match. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't make sense because 12 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 16, but the distribution is way off. It would require a different F2 ratio, probably 12:2:2:0, which doesn't correspond to any standard Mendelian ratio.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming that both genes segregate independently. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not producing independent gametes. But without additional information, I assume independence applies.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, perhaps option G is the closest, although it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the total number of offspring, not the specific phenotypes. But the question asks for phenotypic ratio, so that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC (checkered red) and Bb (brown?), but that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC (checkered red) and bb (plain brown), leading to F1 as Cc (checkered) and bb (plain), and F2 as Cc (checkered) and bb (plain), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not matching any options.\n\nI think I've spent enough time analyzing this. Given the options, I believe option G is the closest, but it doesn't align with the calculations. However, if forced to pick, I might go with",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nWe have two birds involved in an adihybrid cross. One bird is a homozygous checkered red parent (CCBB), and the other is a plain brown parent (ccbb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio of their offspring in the F2 generation. The options provided are A through J, each giving different ratios.\n\nFirst, I should break down the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CCBB. Since it's homozygous, both alleles are C and B. C is the dominant for pigmentation, so having at least one C means they're checkered. B is the dominant for red color, so if there's at least one B, they're red. So CCBB would be checkered red.\n\nThe second parent is ccbb. This is homozygous as well, but both alleles are c and b. c is recessive for pigment, meaning no pigment unless there's a dominant allele. Similarly, b is recessive for brown, which isn't expressed unless there's a dominant allele. So ccbb would be plain brown because neither c nor b is present in any dominant form.\n\nNow, we're looking at an F2 generation, which comes from crossing F1 plants. But wait, actually, when you cross a homozygous recessive (like ccbb) with a heterozygote (like CcBB), the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, when you cross F1 individuals among themselves, that's where the Punnett square comes into play.\n\nSo, let's construct the Punnett square for CcBb x CcBb. Each gamete from the first bird has a 50% chance of being CB or cb, and each gamete from the second bird also has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. However, since both parents are CcBb, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB x cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb x CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb x cb \u2192 c c b b \u2192 cc BB (but wait, bb is brown, right? Because b is recessive for brown.)\n\nWait, correction: the letters represent alleles on homologous chromosomes. So, the notation CcBB means one C and one c, and two B's. Wait, but the original notation might not follow standard notation. Typically, it's written as two pairs, like CcBB would mean for example, for one pair, C and c, and another pair B and B. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nActually, in the context given, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So, CCBB would mean both alleles are C (pigment) and B (red). And ccbb would mean both alleles are c (no pigment) and b (brown).\n\nSo, each bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no, more accurately, each bird can produce gametes CB, cB, CB, etc., but considering dominance, the actual gametes produced would depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nBut for simplicity, assuming all gametes are equally likely, regardless of dominance, maybe. Alternatively, since the parents are homozygous, the F1 would all be CcBb, meaning each gamete would have a 50% chance of carrying either C or c, and a 50% chance of carrying either B or b.\n\nTherefore, when creating the Punnett square, each parent contributes two types of gametes: C/c and B/b. So, each gamete is a combination of these. For example, the first bird could give a gamete of CB, cB, BC, or cb, but typically, without considering dominance, all gametes are considered possible. However, since the parents are homozygous, the actual gametes may vary based on dominance, but often, when making Punnett squares for such problems, all gametes are assumed to carry the alleles independently.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the Punnett square is constructed as follows: each allele is inherited independently, so for each gene, the gamete has a certain probability of contributing each allele.\n\nIn this case, for Gene C: Parent is CC, so all gametes are C.\nFor Gene B: Parent is BB, so all gametes are B.\n\nThus, the F1 from CC x cc would be Cc, and the F1 from BB x bb would be Bb. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, when F1 (CcBb) self-fertilizes, each gene is independent. So, for gene C, the F1 produces gametes C and c with equal probability. Similarly, for gene B, the F1 produces gametes B and b with equal probability.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes would be Cc x Bb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles:\n- For Pigmentation (C): If C is present (any C), then checkered.\n- For Color (B): If B is present (any B), then red.\n\nSo, combining these:\n- Checkered Red: Both C and B present \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\n- Checkered Brown: C present, b present \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered brown\n- Plain Red: c present, B absent \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain red\n- Plain Brown: c present, b present \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the counts:\nEach gene segregates independently, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for CcBb : Ccbb : ccBb : ccbb.\n\nTotal parts = 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nSo:\n- Checkered Red: 9/16 of total \u2192 9\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain Red: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain Brown: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option G says: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". No.\n\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". That seems close but inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the proportion. Let me double-check.\n\nIf the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, that sums to 16. So each phenotype would be proportional to these numbers.\n\nCheckered Red: 9 \u2192 Checkered Brown: 3 \u2192 Plain Red: 3 \u2192 Plain Brown: 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match exactly. Option G is checkered red 12, which is higher than 9. Option D has checkered red 1, which is too low.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted.

But in reality, the F2 generation in a dihybrid cross is 9+3+3+1=16, but when counting specific phenotypes, they sum differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the options count the total number of offspring, not the specific phenotypes. But the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, the options list the counts for each phenotype, e.g., checkered red 6, etc. Based on my earlier calculation, checkered red is 9, which isn't listed in any option except perhaps none. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, brown 9, plain red 1, brown 3. That adds up to 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nIf the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, then:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Plain Red: 3\n- Plain Brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 16 total, but the distribution is off.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, brown 3, plain red 9, brown 3 \u2192 Again, incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Maybe checkered red requires both C and B alleles, whereas plain red requires both c and b. Similarly, checkered brown needs C and b, while plain brown needs c and B.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- CCBB: Checkered Red\n- CcBB: Checkered Brown\n- CCbb: Plain Red\n- Ccbb: Plain Brown\n\nWhen F1 is crossed with F1, the F2 would result in the following:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so:\n\nFor C: 9 (CC), 3 (Cc), 3 (Cc), 1 (cc)\nFor B: same as C.\n\nThus, the combined F2 would be:\n\n- CC x CC \u2192 CC (Checkered Red)\n- CC x Cc \u2192 Cc (Checkered Brown)\n- CC x cc \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n- Cc x CC \u2192 Cc (Checkered Brown)\n- Cc x Cc \u2192 Cc (Checkered Brown)\n- Cc x cc \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n- cc x CC \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n- cc x Cc \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n- cc x cc \u2192 cc (Plain Red)\n\nWait, that approach might not be accurate. Instead, using the Punnett square method:\n\nF1 for C: Cc (since CC x cc gives Cc)\nSame for B: Bb (from BB x bb)\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) self-pollinates, the F2 would be Cc x Bb.\n\nThe phenotypes would be based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered Red: C and B present \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n- Checkered Brown: C present, b absent \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Plain Red: c present, B absent \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Red\n- Plain Brown: c present, b present \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nThus, the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 Checkered Red, 3 Checkered Brown, 3 Plain Red, 1 Plain Brown.\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to match this exact distribution. However, option G says checkered red 12, which is higher than 9. Option D has checkered red 1, which is lower.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the total number of offspring rather than the specific phenotypes. But the question specifies phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect. If the first parent is CC (picturated as checkered red) and the second is BB (picturated as plain brown), then the F1 would be CcBB, and the F2 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven the options, none exactly match this, but option G is the closest with 12, 2, 2, 0, which sums to 16. It suggests a different ratio, possibly due to different segregation probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC (checkered red) and cc (plain brown), but that doesn't make sense because cc would be pure brown, but in the question, the second parent is plain brown (ccbb), so that's correct.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem considers all possibilities, including lethals, but the question doesn't mention anything like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to consider only the phenotypic outcomes without accounting for genetic ratios correctly. Alternatively, maybe the question counts the total number of birds instead of the specific phenotypes. But the question clearly states \"phenotypic ratio.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is none of the above, but since the options are provided, I'll have to choose the closest. Option G is 12, 2, 2, 0, which doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the notation.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation uses each allele separately, not as a pair. For example, CCBB could be represented as two separate traits: C (pigment) and B (color). In that case, the F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (color). Thus, F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, the F2 would be Cc x Bb, leading to the same 9:3:3:1 ratio. Still, the options don't match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the total number of offspring regardless of phenotype. But the question asks for phenotypic ratio, so that's not applicable.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue lies in how the problem defines the F2 generation. The F2 generation refers to the second generation after F1 selfing, which would indeed be 9:3:3:1.\n\nSince none of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1, but option E lists 3,9,1,3, which is 16 total, but the breakdown is 3 Checkered Red, 9 Checkered Brown, 1 Plain Red, 3 Plain Brown. That doesn't align with our expectation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial parents were incorrectly interpreted. If the parents were CC (checkered red) and bb (plain brown), then the F1 would be Cc (checkered) and bb (plain). Then, the F2 would be Cc x bb, leading to 1:1:1:1. But that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC (checkered red) and bb (plain brown), so F1 would be Cc (checkered) and bb (plain). Then, F2 would be Cc x bb, which would result in Cc (checkered) and bb (plain), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are CC (checkered red) and Bb (pure brown?), that wouldn't fit the description.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CCBB, which could be CC (pigment) and BB (color), making it checkered red. The second parent is ccbb, which is cc (no pigment) and bb (brown), making it plain brown. So, F1 would be Cc (pigment) and Bb (color), so CcBb.\n\nThen, F2 would be Cc x Bb, resulting in 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly. However, option G mentions 12, 2, 2, 0, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the question intended to use a different approach, such as considering the presence of dominant alleles without considering the order. For instance, in F2, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both C and B: Checkered Red\n- C and b: Checkered Brown\n- c and B: Plain Red\n- c and b: Plain Brown\n\nWith counts 9,3,3,1 respectively.\n\nLooking at the options again, none directly match. However, option D mentions checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our 9:3:3:1 but inverted. So, perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the entire population, not just the F2 generation. If that's the case, the total number of birds would be 16, but the breakdown depends on the phenotypes.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would still be 9:3:3:1, but the total number would be 16. However, the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance rules and consider all alleles present, leading to different ratios. But that's against standard genetics principles.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options exactly match this, perhaps the intended answer is option G, even though it doesn't match. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, option G is \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't make sense because 12 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 16, but the distribution is way off. It would require a different F2 ratio, probably 12:2:2:0, which doesn't correspond to any standard Mendelian ratio.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming that both genes segregate independently. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not producing independent gametes. But without additional information, I assume independence applies.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, perhaps option G is the closest, although it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the total number of offspring, not the specific phenotypes. But the question asks for phenotypic ratio, so that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC (checkered red) and Bb (brown?), but that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC (checkered red) and bb (plain brown), leading to F1 as Cc (checkered) and bb (plain), and F2 as Cc (checkered) and bb (plain), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not matching any options.\n\nI think I've spent enough time analyzing this. Given the options, I believe option G is the closest, but it doesn't align with the calculations.

The other allele is recessive, so you need two c alleles to get the plain pattern.\n\nThen there are the colors. Red is controlled by a dominant gene B, meaning if you have at least one B allele, the bird will be red. The other allele is recessive, so if you have two b alleles, it'll be brown. So, the possible combinations for both traits are:\n\n- Checkered red (CcBb)\n- Checkered brown (Ccbb)\n- Plain red (ccBB)\n- Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nThe cross described is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). So, let me think about how to set up the Punnett square here.\n\nFirst, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. Let's break down their alleles:\n\n- Parent 1 (CCBB): They're homozygous for both genes. So, each gamete will carry CB.\n- Parent 2 (ccbb): They're also homozygous, carrying cb for both genes.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, wait. Wait, the notation might mean different things. Maybe CCBB means that each parent has two copies of the first gene (C) and two copies of the second gene (B). Similarly, ccbb would have two c's and two b's.\n\nSo, when these birds mate, each parent can produce four types of gametes:\n\nFrom CCBB:\n- C (from the first gene pair) and B (from the second gene pair), so gamete CB.\nSince both pairs are heterozygous, but in this case, since each parent is homozygous for both genes, all gametes from them will be CB or cb? Wait, no. Each parent has two copies of each gene, but since they're homozygous, each parent can only contribute one copy of each gene. So, for example, CCBB would produce gametes that are either CB or BB, right? But wait, actually, wait\u2014the notation might be confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, maybe the notation is as follows: CCBB could mean that the bird has two Cs and two Bs. So, each parent is CCBB, meaning they have two Cs and two Bs. Since they're homozygous for both genes, each gamete will carry one C and one B allele, making all gametes CB.\n\nSimilarly, ccbb would have two cs and two bs. Since they're homozygous, each gamete will carry one c and one b allele, making all gametes cb.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because then the F1 would all be CcBb, but the answer options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the notation is such that each parent contributes half of each gene separately. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider each parent's genotype:\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 This means that each bird has two Cs and two Bs. Since it's homozygous, all gametes will be CB.\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 Each bird has two cs and two bs. All gametes will be cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these gametes. But wait, if Parent 1 produces CB gametes and Parent 2 produces cb gametes, then the F1 would be CcBb. Because each gamete combines with another. So, all F1 individuals would be CcBb. That makes sense because the parents are both homozygous.\n\nNow, let's look at the possible F1 offspring. If every individual is CcBb, then what phenotype do they express?\n\nFor color (B):\n- B is dominant, so any presence of B results in red.\n- bb results in brown.\nSo, CcBb would be red.\n\nFor pattern (C):\n- C is dominant, so any presence of C results in checkered.\n- cc results in plain.\nSo, CcBb would be checkered.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals are checkered red.\n\nNow, we need to consider the F2 generation, but wait, the question asks about the F2 generation after crossing a checkered red bird (CCBB) with a plain brown bird (ccbb). Wait, no, hold on. Let me reread the question.\n\nWait, the initial setup is that the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). So, the F1 generation would be the result of crossing these two.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that each parent would produce gametes CB and cb, leading to all F1 being CcBb. However, according to the standard dihybrid cross, the F1 should be CcBb, but in reality, when you cross two homozygotes, like CCBB and ccbb, each parent can only give CB and cb, respectively. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, which would all be red and checkered.\n\nBut looking back at the question, it says \"Complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adi hybrid crosses usually involve two different parents. In this case, one parent is homozygous checkered red (CCBB), and the other is plain brown (ccbb). So, the F1 would be CcBb, which would all be red and checkered.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the F2 generation. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read again.\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adi-hybrid crosses typically involve two different parents. In this case, one is homozygous checkered red (CCBB) and the other is plain brown (ccbb). So, the F1 would be CcBb, which is all red and checkered.\n\nBut then why are we considering F2? Unless I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check the parents' genotypes. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb).\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is different. Maybe CCBB represents that the bird has two dominant alleles for both genes. So, each parent is CCBB, meaning two C's and two B's. Since they're homozygous, each gamete carries CB.\n\nAnd the other parent is ccbb, meaning two c's and two b's, so each gamete carries cb.\n\nTherefore, all F1 would be CcBb, which is red and checkered.\n\nNow, the F2 generation would require crossing F1 individuals, but the question specifies the F2 generation after crossing the parents. So, perhaps the question is not about F2 but about the F1 itself.\n\nWait, no, the question states: \"Complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\"\n\nHmm, that seems contradictory. If the parents are homozygous, their offspring won't go through F1, F2 generations. They'd all be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generated from a dihybrid cross between CCBB and ccbb, assuming they can produce gametes independently. Wait, but CCBB and ccbb are homozygous, so their gametes are fixed.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would all be CcBb, which is red and checkered. Then, the F2 wouldn't exist because all F1 are the same.\n\nBut the question mentions F2, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the parents aren't homozygous. Perhaps the notation is different, like CC indicates a dominant allele, and BB indicates another. Or maybe it's a typo and should be something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CcBB and ccbb, but that's not what was stated.\n\nWait, let me try again. The parents are CCBB and ccbb.\n\nEach parent is homozygous for both genes. So, each parent can only produce gametes that are CB or cb, respectively.\n\nThus, the F1 would all be CcBb, which is red and checkered.\n\nNow, the question refers to the F2 generation, but if the parents are homozygous, their offspring can't go through F1, F2, etc., because they're all the same.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question intended to refer to F1 instead of F2. But the user specified F2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe one is CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and the other is ccbb (homozygous plain brown). So, when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb (red, checkered), and the F2 would depend on the cross of F1 with themselves.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"for the F_2 generation\", so perhaps the question is correct and the parents are not both homozygous.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB (so C and B) and cc bb (c and b). So, each parent can produce gametes CB and cb.\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, which is red, checkered.\n\nThen, the F2 would be the cross of F1 with F1.\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be CcBb x CcBb.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine the genotypic ratios.\n\nUsing a Punnett square:\n\nCcBb x CcBb\n\nEach gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately.\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- BB: probability = (2/3 * 2/3) + (1/3 * 1/3) ? Wait, no. Wait, each gene is controlled separately. So, for the color gene, each parent contributes B or b.\n\nParent 1: Cc (for color) \u2192 gametes: C and c.\n\nParent 2: Cc \u2192 same.\n\nSo, for color:\n\nProbability of B (dominant) = (probability of at least one B) = 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for pattern (C):\n\nParent 1: CC \u2192 gametes: C.\n\nParent 2: cc \u2192 gametes: c.\n\nSo, for pattern:\n\nProbability of C (dominant) = 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 3/4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, since each parent is homozygous for both genes, their gametes are fixed. For color, each parent can only give C or c. For pattern, each parent can only give C or c.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals are CcBb, which is red, checkered.\n\nThen, F2 would be the cross of CcBb x CcBb.\n\nBut since all F1 are CcBb, their F2 would inherit from Cc x Cc for each gene.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\nProbability of dominant allele (C or B) = 3/4.\n\nProbability of recessive (c or b) = 1/4.\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)^2 : 2*(3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to 9:6:1.\n\nBut wait, for both genes, the phenotypic expression depends on the combination of the alleles.\n\nWait, no, because each gene's dominance is independent. So, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:6:1, where 9 are red and checkered, 6 are red and plain, and 1 is brown and plain.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option A shows checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Option D shows checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. None seem to match 9:6:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nCrossing a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) with a plain brown bird (ccbb).\n\nSo, each parent is homozygous for both genes. Thus, all F1 would be CcBb, which is red and checkered.\n\nThen, F2 would be the cross of F1 with themselves. So, each gene is independent, so the phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)^2 : 2*(3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)^2 for each gene, resulting in 9:6:1.\n\nBut none of the options given match this exactly. The closest option is E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But that's reversed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to F1 instead of F2. But the user clearly mentioned F2.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the phenotypic expressions. Let's see.\n\nEach bird has two genes: color (B/b) and pattern (C/c).\n\nPhenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nIf both B and C are present, it's red and checkered.\n\nIf B is present but c is present, it's red and plain.\n\nIf c is present regardless, it's brown regardless.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and checkered (B and C both present)\n2. Red and plain (B present, c absent)\n3. Brown and checkered (b present, C present)\n4. Brown and plain (b present, c absent)\n\nNow, in the F1 generation, all are CcBb, so all four phenotypes would occur based on their random assortment.\n\nThe expected phenotypic ratio is calculated using a 9:6:3:0 rule for two loci, but in this case, since both genes are dominant, the phenotypic ratio is 9:6:1.\n\nSo, 9% checkered red, 6% checkered brown, 3% plain red, 0% plain brown.\n\nWait, that doesn't align with any of the options given. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD.1:3:9:3\n\nE.3:9:1:3\n\nWait, none of these match 9:6:1. But option C is 9:3:3:1, which is similar but includes a 3:1 split. That doesn't fit our scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether B is present (red) or not (brown), and whether C is present (checkered) or not (plain).\n\nAll F1 are CcBb, so:\n\n- For color: B present \u2192 red, B absent \u2192 brown.\n\n- For pattern: C present \u2192 checkered, C absent \u2192 plain.\n\nSo, possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red & Checkered (B and C)\n2. Red & Plain (B and not C)\n3. Brown & Checkered (not B and C)\n4. Brown & Plain (not B and not C)\n\nThe expected counts would be based on the probabilities:\n\nThe probability of B present (B or B\u0304) is 3/4, and C present is 3/4. Since they're independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is:\n\nRed & Checkered: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nRed & Plain: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nBrown & Checkered: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nBrown & Plain: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16 parts.\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches this calculation.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly state 9:3:3:1 except option C.\n\nBut wait, in the options, option C is labeled as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought the F2 would be the cross of F1, but the question refers to F2 generation, which suggests that the parents are both F1. But in the question, the parents are homozygous, so their F1 would all be the same.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1 generation rather than F2. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to option C.\n\nBut the options include C as \"9:3:3:1\", which matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option C, showing the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. It's about the pigeon checkered pattern being controlled by a dominant gene C, which means that if someone has at least one C allele, they'll have a checkered pattern. The other allele is recessive, so you need two c alleles to get the plain pattern.\n\nThen there are the colors. Red is controlled by a dominant gene B, meaning if you have at least one B allele, the bird will be red. The other allele is recessive, so if you have two b alleles, it'll be brown. So, the possible combinations for both traits are:\n\n- Checkered red (CcBb)\n- Checkered brown (Ccbb)\n- Plain red (ccBB)\n- Plain brown (ccbb)\n\nThe cross described is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). So, let me think about how to set up the Punnett square here.\n\nFirst, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. Let's break down their alleles:\n\n- Parent 1 (CCBB): They're homozygous for both genes. So, each gamete will carry CB.\n- Parent 2 (ccbb): They're also homozygous, carrying cb for both genes.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, wait. Wait, the notation might mean different things. Maybe CCBB means that each parent has two copies of the first gene (C) and two copies of the second gene (B). Similarly, ccbb would have two c's and two b's.\n\nSo, when these birds mate, each parent can produce four types of gametes:\n\nFrom CCBB:\n- C (from the first gene pair) and B (from the second gene pair), so gamete CB.\nSince both pairs are heterozygous, but in this case, since each parent is homozygous for both genes, all gametes from them will be CB or cb? Wait, no. Each parent has two copies of each gene, but since they're homozygous, each parent can only contribute one copy of each gene. So, for example, CCBB would produce gametes that are either CB or BB, right? But wait, actually, wait\u2014the notation might be confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, maybe the notation is as follows: CCBB could mean that the bird has two Cs and two Bs. So, each parent is CCBB, meaning they have two Cs and two Bs. Since they're homozygous for both genes, each gamete will carry one C and one B allele, making all gametes CB.\n\nSimilarly, ccbb would have two cs and two bs. Since they're homozygous, each gamete will carry one c and one b allele, making all gametes cb.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because then the F1 would all be CcBb, but the answer options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the notation is such that each parent contributes half of each gene separately. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider each parent's genotype:\n\nParent 1: CCBB \u2192 This means that each bird has two Cs and two Bs. Since it's homozygous, all gametes will be CB.\nParent 2: ccbb \u2192 Each bird has two cs and two bs. All gametes will be cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these gametes. But wait, if Parent 1 produces CB gametes and Parent 2 produces cb gametes, then the F1 would be CcBb. Because each gamete combines with another. So, all F1 individuals would be CcBb. That makes sense because the parents are both homozygous.\n\nNow, let's look at the possible F1 offspring. If every individual is CcBb, then what phenotype do they express?\n\nFor color (B):\n- B is dominant, so any presence of B results in red.\n- bb results in brown.\nSo, CcBb would be red.\n\nFor pattern (C):\n- C is dominant, so any presence of C results in checkered.\n- cc results in plain.\nSo, CcBb would be checkered.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals are checkered red.\n\nNow, we need to consider the F2 generation, but wait, the question asks about the F2 generation after crossing a checkered red bird (CCBB) with a plain brown bird (ccbb). Wait, no, hold on. Let me reread the question.\n\nWait, the initial setup is that the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb). So, the F1 generation would be the result of crossing these two.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that each parent would produce gametes CB and cb, leading to all F1 being CcBb. However, according to the standard dihybrid cross, the F1 should be CcBb, but in reality, when you cross two homozygotes, like CCBB and ccbb, each parent can only give CB and cb, respectively. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, which would all be red and checkered.\n\nBut looking back at the question, it says \"Complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adi hybrid crosses usually involve two different parents. In this case, one parent is homozygous checkered red (CCBB), and the other is plain brown (ccbb). So, the F1 would be CcBb, which would all be red and checkered.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the F2 generation. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read again.\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adi-hybrid crosses typically involve two different parents. In this case, one is homozygous checkered red (CCBB) and the other is plain brown (ccbb). So, the F1 would be CcBb, which is all red and checkered.\n\nBut then why are we considering F2? Unless I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check the parents' genotypes. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a plain brown bird (ccbb).\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is different. Maybe CCBB represents that the bird has two dominant alleles for both genes. So, each parent is CCBB, meaning two C's and two B's. Since they're homozygous, each gamete carries CB.\n\nAnd the other parent is ccbb, meaning two c's and two b's, so each gamete carries cb.\n\nTherefore, all F1 would be CcBb, which is red and checkered.\n\nNow, the F2 generation would require crossing F1 individuals, but the question specifies the F2 generation after crossing the parents. So, perhaps the question is not about F2 but about the F1 itself.\n\nWait, no, the question states: \"Complete a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\"\n\nHmm, that seems contradictory. If the parents are homozygous, their offspring won't go through F1, F2 generations. They'd all be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generated from a dihybrid cross between CCBB and ccbb, assuming they can produce gametes independently. Wait, but CCBB and ccbb are homozygous, so their gametes are fixed.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would all be CcBb, which is red and checkered. Then, the F2 wouldn't exist because all F1 are the same.\n\nBut the question mentions F2, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the parents aren't homozygous. Perhaps the notation is different, like CC indicates a dominant allele, and BB indicates another. Or maybe it's a typo and should be something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CcBB and ccbb, but that's not what was stated.\n\nWait, let me try again. The parents are CCBB and ccbb.\n\nEach parent is homozygous for both genes. So, each parent can only produce gametes that are CB or cb, respectively.\n\nThus, the F1 would all be CcBb, which is red and checkered.\n\nNow, the question refers to the F2 generation, but if the parents are homozygous, their offspring can't go through F1, F2, etc., because they're all the same.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question intended to refer to F1 instead of F2. But the user specified F2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Maybe one is CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and the other is ccbb (homozygous plain brown). So, when crossed, the F1 would be CcBb (red, checkered), and the F2 would depend on the cross of F1 with themselves.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"for the F_2 generation\", so perhaps the question is correct and the parents are not both homozygous.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are CC BB (so C and B) and cc bb (c and b). So, each parent can produce gametes CB and cb.\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, which is red, checkered.\n\nThen, the F2 would be the cross of F1 with F1.\n\nSo, F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be CcBb x CcBb.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratios, we need to determine the genotypic ratios.\n\nUsing a Punnett square:\n\nCcBb x CcBb\n\nEach gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately.\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- BB: probability = (2/3 * 2/3) + (1/3 * 1/3) ? Wait, no. Wait, each gene is controlled separately. So, for the color gene, each parent contributes B or b.\n\nParent 1: Cc (for color) \u2192 gametes: C and c.\n\nParent 2: Cc \u2192 same.\n\nSo, for color:\n\nProbability of B (dominant) = (probability of at least one B) = 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for pattern (C):\n\nParent 1: CC \u2192 gametes: C.\n\nParent 2: cc \u2192 gametes: c.\n\nSo, for pattern:\n\nProbability of C (dominant) = 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 3/4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, since each parent is homozygous for both genes, their gametes are fixed. For color, each parent can only give C or c. For pattern, each parent can only give C or c.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals are CcBb, which is red, checkered.\n\nThen, F2 would be the cross of CcBb x CcBb.\n\nBut since all F1 are CcBb, their F2 would inherit from Cc x Cc for each gene.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\nProbability of dominant allele (C or B) = 3/4.\n\nProbability of recessive (c or b) = 1/4.\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)^2 : 2*(3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to 9:6:1.\n\nBut wait, for both genes, the phenotypic expression depends on the combination of the alleles.\n\nWait, no, because each gene's dominance is independent. So, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:6:1, where 9 are red and checkered, 6 are red and plain, and 1 is brown and plain.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option A shows checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Option D shows checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. None seem to match 9:6:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\n\nCrossing a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) with a plain brown bird (ccbb).\n\nSo, each parent is homozygous for both genes. Thus, all F1 would be CcBb, which is red and checkered.\n\nThen, F2 would be the cross of F1 with themselves. So, each gene is independent, so the phenotypic ratio would be (3/4)^2 : 2*(3/4)*(1/4) : (1/4)^2 for each gene, resulting in 9:6:1.\n\nBut none of the options given match this exactly. The closest option is E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But that's reversed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to F1 instead of F2. But the user clearly mentioned F2.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the phenotypic expressions. Let's see.\n\nEach bird has two genes: color (B/b) and pattern (C/c).\n\nPhenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nIf both B and C are present, it's red and checkered.\n\nIf B is present but c is present, it's red and plain.\n\nIf c is present regardless, it's brown regardless.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and checkered (B and C both present)\n2. Red and plain (B present, c absent)\n3. Brown and checkered (b present, C present)\n4. Brown and plain (b present, c absent)\n\nNow, in the F1 generation, all are CcBb, so all four phenotypes would occur based on their random assortment.\n\nThe expected phenotypic ratio is calculated using a 9:6:3:0 rule for two loci, but in this case, since both genes are dominant, the phenotypic ratio is 9:6:1.\n\nSo, 9% checkered red, 6% checkered brown, 3% plain red, 0% plain brown.\n\nWait, that doesn't align with any of the options given. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD.1:3:9:3\n\nE.3:9:1:3\n\nWait, none of these match 9:6:1. But option C is 9:3:3:1, which is similar but includes a 3:1 split. That doesn't fit our scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether B is present (red) or not (brown), and whether C is present (checkered) or not (plain).\n\nAll F1 are CcBb, so:\n\n- For color: B present \u2192 red, B absent \u2192 brown.\n\n- For pattern: C present \u2192 checkered, C absent \u2192 plain.\n\nSo, possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red & Checkered (B and C)\n2. Red & Plain (B and not C)\n3. Brown & Checkered (not B and C)\n4. Brown & Plain (not B and not C)\n\nThe expected counts would be based on the probabilities:\n\nThe probability of B present (B or B\u0304) is 3/4, and C present is 3/4. Since they're independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is:\n\nRed & Checkered: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nRed & Plain: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nBrown & Checkered: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nBrown & Plain: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1=16 parts.\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches this calculation.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly state 9:3:3:1 except option C.\n\nBut wait, in the options, option C is labeled as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought the F2 would be the cross of F1, but the question refers to F2 generation, which suggests that the parents are both F1. But in the question, the parents are homozygous, so their F1 would all be the same.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question intended to refer to the F1 generation rather than F2. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to option C.\n\nBut the options include C as \"9:3:3:1\", which matches our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option C, showing the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Wait, no, actually, wait\u2014the problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is c, which is recessive. So, the first bird must be CC cc, but wait, no\u2014that can't be right because each bird has two alleles. Wait, maybe it's CC for the pattern and cc for color? Or perhaps the bird has two genes, one for pattern (C) and one for color (B), where B is dominant for red and b is recessive for brown. Hmm, let me clarify.\n\nThe second bird is a plain brown bird, meaning its alleles are cc for the pattern and bb for color. Because brown is the recessive phenotype, so bb would make it brown. But wait, the problem states that red is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by b. So, if the second bird is plain brown, then their genotype must be cc bb, right?\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, the first bird is a homozygous checkered red bird. Homozygous would mean both alleles are dominant. So, if the pattern is C and color is B, then the first bird would be CC BB. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem mentions that the pattern is controlled by C and the color by B. Maybe the first bird is CC BB, making it checkered (since C is dominant) and red (as B is dominant).\n\nSo, the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb (plain brown)\n\nWe're looking at an adihybridcross, but wait, the user mentioned \"adihybridcross.\" Typically, adihybrid refers to dihybrid crosses, but adi usually stands for adohybrid, which isn't standard. Maybe they meant a regular dihybrid cross. Anyway, the cross is between these two birds.\n\nThe task is to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation, showing the phenotypic ratios and other related data like genotypes and genotypic frequencies.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the possible gametes from each parent.\n\nFor Parent 1 (CC BB):\n- Since both alleles are dominant, all gametes will carry the dominant allele.\n- So, Parent 1 can only produce gametes CB or BB? Wait, no\u2014wait, if the bird is homozygous for both traits, then all its gametes will carry the dominant alleles. So, Parent 1 can only produce gametes that are CB (for color) and BB (for pattern)? Wait, no\u2014wait, each gene is separate, so for each gene, you have the possibilities.\n\nWait, no\u2014the bird is homozygous for both, so for each gene, it's either dominant or not. So, for Pattern (C), since it's homozygous dominant, all gametes get C. For Color (B), same thing\u2014it's homozygous dominant, so all gametes get B. Therefore, Parent 1 can only produce gametes CB, where C is the pattern allele and B is the color allele.\n\nSimilarly, Parent 2 (cc bb):\n- Both alleles are recessive, so all gametes will carry the recessive alleles.\n- Therefore, Parent 2 can only produce gametes cb, where c is the pattern allele and b is the color allele.\n\nNow, when we cross Parent 1 (CB) and Parent 2 (cb), what's the F1 generation? Each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nSo, for the pattern gene:\n- Parent 1 gives C\n- Parent 2 gives c\n- So, F1 genotype for pattern is Cc.\n\nFor the color gene:\n- Parent 1 gives B\n- Parent 2 gives b\n- So, F1 genotype for color is Bb.\n\nTherefore, F1 individuals are CcBb. All F1s are the same genotype because they inherit exactly one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. To determine the F2, we need to consider the selfing of the F1 plants. However, the question seems to suggest using a Punnett square for F2 based on the F1 parents, but I think I might have misread it earlier.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adi usually stands for adohybrid, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and they meant a regular dihybrid cross. So, perhaps the parents are both heterozygous for both traits. Wait, but according to the problem statement, Parent 1 is homozygous for both (CC BB) and Parent 2 is also homozygous (cc bb). That seems unusual because typically, dihybrid crosses involve heterozygotes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are actually different. Wait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb. That makes sense as they're both homozygous for each trait.\n\nBut then, how do you cross them to get F2? Normally, you'd cross a heterozygote with itself or with another plant. But here, both parents are homozygous. So, their offspring would all be homozygous, unless they cross one with another plant. Wait, perhaps the question intended to use a heterozygous parent, like Cc for one gene and Bb for another. Otherwise, crossing two homozygous plants would result in all offspring being homozygous.\n\nBut given the options provided, it seems like the answer involves considering the F2 from a cross where one parent is Cc and the other is Bb. But the question states that the parents are homozygous, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, and I need to proceed despite the parental genotypes being homozygous. So, assuming Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb.\n\nWhen crossed, all offspring will be CcBb, as previously established.\n\nThen, the next step is to determine the F1, F2, etc., but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, the F1 would all be CcBb. Then, when you cross F1 plants among themselves, you get F2.\n\nWait, but the question asks about an adihybridcross, which often refers to dihybrid cross. So, perhaps the intended parents were Cc for one gene and Bb for another. Let me assume that and proceed accordingly.\n\nAssuming Parent 1 is Cc (heterozygous for pattern) and Parent 2 is Bb (heterozygous for color), then F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be calculated based on that.\n\nBut the initial problem says the parents are homozygous. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that their offspring will all be CcBb, and thus, any further crosses would follow from that.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking for an F2 generation, so perhaps the cross should be between F1 and F1 again, or F1 and another F1.\n\nWait, but the question specifically says \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" which suggests that the cross is between two homozygous plants.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would all be CcBb, and the F2 would consist of all CcBb as well, because both parents are homozygous. Thus, the F2 would be the same as the F1.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because F2 would just be the same as F1, leading to no change. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is to treat the parents as Cc and Bb, even though they're stated as homozygous.\n\nThis confusion arises because the wording is ambiguous. If the parents are indeed homozygous, then their offspring will all be CcBb, and thus, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the same. But that contradicts the idea of an F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are considered as Cc and Bb (each homozygous for one trait), then the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow Mendelian ratios.\n\nGiven the options provided, option D shows a phenotypic ratio of 1:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. Wait, that's the typical ratio for a dihybrid cross (Cc x Bb), resulting in 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:3:1\n\nEtc. So, the correct ratio for a dihybrid cross is C: D, depending on the letters used.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies the checkered pattern as C and plain as c, and red as B and brown as b. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (CB): dominant for both traits.\n\n- Checkered Brown (CB): dominant for pattern, recessive for color.\n\n- Plain Red (cb): recessive for pattern, dominant for color.\n\n- Plain Brown (cb): recessive for both traits.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the genetic ratios produced by the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nIf the parents are Cc and Bb, then F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow a 1:2:1:2:1:2:1:2 ratio for the four phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 would have the phenotypic ratios based on the combination of the two traits. The number of each phenotype would be as follows:\n\nFor each trait, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Dominant for both: 3/4 of the time.\n\n- Dominant for one and recessive for the other: 1/4 for each pair.\n\n- Recessive for both: 1/4.\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities multiply.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.\n\nThus, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CB): 9/16\n\n2. Checkered Brown (CB): 3/16\n\n3. Plain Red (cb): 3/16\n\n4. Plain Brown (cb): 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16 parts, 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nYes, that matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nAlright, there's a cross between two birds: one is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means both its alleles are dominant for red (C) and for checkered (let's say that's another dominant trait). Wait, no, actually, wait\u2014the problem says the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is c, which is recessive.

Or perhaps the bird has two genes, one for pattern (C) and one for color (B), where B is dominant for red and b is recessive for brown. Hmm, let me clarify.\n\nThe second bird is a plain brown bird, meaning its alleles are cc for the pattern and bb for color. Because brown is the recessive phenotype, so bb would make it brown. But wait, the problem states that red is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by b.

All F1s are the same genotype because they inherit exactly one allele from each parent for each gene.\n\nNow, moving on to the F2 generation. To determine the F2, we need to consider the selfing of the F1 plants. However, the question seems to suggest using a Punnett square for F2 based on the F1 parents, but I think I might have misread it earlier.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, adi usually stands for adohybrid, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and they meant a regular dihybrid cross. So, perhaps the parents are both heterozygous for both traits. Wait, but according to the problem statement, Parent 1 is homozygous for both (CC BB) and Parent 2 is also homozygous (cc bb). That seems unusual because typically, dihybrid crosses involve heterozygotes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are actually different. Wait, the problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, Parent 1 is CC BB, and Parent 2 is cc bb. That makes sense as they're both homozygous for each trait.\n\nBut then, how do you cross them to get F2? Normally, you'd cross a heterozygote with itself or with another plant. But here, both parents are homozygous. So, their offspring would all be homozygous, unless they cross one with another plant. Wait, perhaps the question intended to use a heterozygous parent, like Cc for one gene and Bb for another. Otherwise, crossing two homozygous plants would result in all offspring being homozygous.\n\nBut given the options provided, it seems like the answer involves considering the F2 from a cross where one parent is Cc and the other is Bb. But the question states that the parents are homozygous, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, and I need to proceed despite the parental genotypes being homozygous. So, assuming Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb.\n\nWhen crossed, all offspring will be CcBb, as previously established.\n\nThen, the next step is to determine the F1, F2, etc., but in this case, since both parents are homozygous, the F1 would all be CcBb. Then, when you cross F1 plants among themselves, you get F2.\n\nWait, but the question asks about an adihybridcross, which often refers to dihybrid cross. So, perhaps the intended parents were Cc for one gene and Bb for another. Let me assume that and proceed accordingly.\n\nAssuming Parent 1 is Cc (heterozygous for pattern) and Parent 2 is Bb (heterozygous for color), then F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be calculated based on that.\n\nBut the initial problem says the parents are homozygous. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that their offspring will all be CcBb, and thus, any further crosses would follow from that.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking for an F2 generation, so perhaps the cross should be between F1 and F1 again, or F1 and another F1.\n\nWait, but the question specifically says \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" which suggests that the cross is between two homozygous plants.\n\nIn that case, the F1 would all be CcBb, and the F2 would consist of all CcBb as well, because both parents are homozygous. Thus, the F2 would be the same as the F1.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because F2 would just be the same as F1, leading to no change. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is to treat the parents as Cc and Bb, even though they're stated as homozygous.\n\nThis confusion arises because the wording is ambiguous. If the parents are indeed homozygous, then their offspring will all be CcBb, and thus, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the same. But that contradicts the idea of an F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are considered as Cc and Bb (each homozygous for one trait), then the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow Mendelian ratios.\n\nGiven the options provided, option D shows a phenotypic ratio of 1:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. Wait, that's the typical ratio for a dihybrid cross (Cc x Bb), resulting in 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:3:1\n\nEtc. So, the correct ratio for a dihybrid cross is C: D, depending on the letters used.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies the checkered pattern as C and plain as c, and red as B and brown as b. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (CB): dominant for both traits.\n\n- Checkered Brown (CB): dominant for pattern, recessive for color.\n\n- Plain Red (cb): recessive for pattern, dominant for color.\n\n- Plain Brown (cb): recessive for both traits.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the genetic ratios produced by the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nIf the parents are Cc and Bb, then F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow a 1:2:1:2:1:2:1:2 ratio for the four phenotypes.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 would have the phenotypic ratios based on the combination of the two traits. The number of each phenotype would be as follows:\n\nFor each trait, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Dominant for both: 3/4 of the time.\n\n- Dominant for one and recessive for the other: 1/4 for each pair.\n\n- Recessive for both: 1/4.\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities multiply.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.\n\nThus, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CB): 9/16\n\n2. Checkered Brown (CB): 3/16\n\n3. Plain Red (cb): 3/16\n\n4. Plain Brown (cb): 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16 parts, 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nYes, that matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The genes involved are C (dominant for checkered), c (recessive for plain), B (dominant for red), and b (recessive for brown). We need to create a Punnett square for an adi hybrid cross, which means each parent contributes two alleles. \n\nFirst, let me break down the parents:\n\nParent 1: Checkered red bird \u2192 genotype should be CC BB because checkered is dominant over plain, and red is dominant over brown. So both parents are homozygous for these traits.\n\nParent 2: Plain brown bird \u2192 genotype would be cc bb since plain is recessive and brown is also recessive.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first parent says \"checkered red\" bird. Since checkered is dominant over plain, if it's checkered red, that suggests that the alleles at the C locus are present in such a way that the phenotype is checkered. But how exactly does checkered work? Hmm. Maybe it's just that the presence of the dominant allele makes it checkered. So Parent 1 is CC BB.\n\nParent 2 is plain brown \u2192 so they must be cc bb.\n\nNow, we're making an adi hybrid cross between these two. Adi hybrid usually refers to a cross where one parent is heterozygous for one trait and the other is homozygous recessive. Wait, but here both parents are homozygous. Wait, hold on\u2014no, actually, Parent 1 is CC BB, so he's homozygous for both dominant traits, and Parent 2 is cc bb, homozygous for both recessive traits. That can't form a dihybrid cross because dihybrid crosses involve heterozygotes.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says \"adihybridcross,\" but perhaps it's a typo or misnomer. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross involving two different pairs. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about dihybrid, but about a cross where each parent has two different alleles for each gene. Let me re-examine the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Genotype for C is CC, for B is BB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Genotype for C is cc, for B is bb.\n\nSo when they mate, the possible gametes from Parent 1 will be CB (since both C alleles are dominant), and from Parent 2, they'll be cb.\n\nSo the F1 would get one allele from each parent, so from Parent 1: C and B, from Parent 2: c and b. So the F1 genotypes would be Cc Bb.\n\nThen the F1s would self-fertilize to produce F2. So let's construct the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nThe F1 is Cc Bb. So the gametes from F1 would be:\n\n- From C locus: C and c.\n- From B locus: B and b.\n\nEach combination is equally likely, so four types: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nThus, the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n1. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 for C locus: CC, Cc, cc.\n2. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 for B locus: BB, Bb, bb.\n\nSo the F2 would be a grid of all possible combinations, resulting in 9 squares.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles. Let's map them:\n\n- C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- c and B \u2192 Plain Red\n- c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio depends on how many of each genotype there are in the F2.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of CC = 25%\n- Cc = 50%\n- cc = 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- Probability of BB = 25%\n- Bb = 50%\n- bb = 25%\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n\nCheckered Red: CC \u00d7 BB = 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 6 out of 100.\n\nCheckered Brown: CC \u00d7 Bb = 6.25% \u2192 6 out of 100.\n\nPlain Red: cc \u00d7 BB = 6.25% \u2192 6 out of 100.\n\nPlain Brown: cc \u00d7 Bb = 6.25% \u2192 6 out of 100.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps the question expects us to consider all possible phenotypes, including those not explicitly mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was incorrect. Let me double-check the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps Parent 1 is not CC BB but instead something else. Wait, the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird.\" So the alleles are dominant for checkered and red, implying that the bird has the dominant alleles for both traits. So yes, CC BB.\n\nParent 2 is \"plain brown bird.\" So their alleles are recessive: cc bb.\n\nThus, the cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nThe F2 would be a dihybrid cross, leading to 9 possible genotypic classes.\n\nSo, checking back:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- etc., but more accurately, using Punnett squares.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The correct approach is to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio based on the genetic makeup.\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio for two linked or independent genes is typically 9:3:3:1, depending on whether they are linked or independent. If independent, then:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option D mentions 1:3:9:3, which seems reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then all F2 individuals will be Cc Bb. Therefore, their genotypes are all the same, leading to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but that would mean all 9 F2 individuals are Checkered Red or Plain Red, depending on the alleles.\n\nWait, no, because in dihybrid crosses, the F2 includes all combinations, regardless of dominance. So:\n\n- For the C locus: CC, Cc, cc\n- For the B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo combining them gives:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Wait, no, because bb is brown, right?\n\nWait, no, wait. Because B is dominant for red, so bb would express brown. Similarly, Bb would express red.\n\nWait, but in this case, the F2 would include:\n\n- All individuals where C is dominant (C) and B is dominant (B): Checkered Red\n- All individuals where C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b): Checkered Brown\n- All individuals where C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B): Plain Red\n- All individuals where C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (b): Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: When either C or B is present\n- Checkered Brown: When C is present but B is absent\n- Plain Red: When C is absent but B is present\n- Plain Brown: When neither C nor B is present\n\nSo the number of each phenotype would correspond to the number of genotypic classes.\n\nIn the F2 cross, for each gene:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombined, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% + 50% = 75% \u2192 75 out of 100\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 25 out of 100\n- Plain Red: 25% \u2192 25 out of 100\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 25 out of 100\n\nSo the ratio would be 75:25:25:25, which simplifies to 3:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly give this. However, option H is 5:3:2:6, which isn't matching. Option J is 2:6:3:1, still not matching. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which adds up to 16, but the total should be 9. Hmm, I think I might be miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, because the actual numbers are 75% Checkered Red, 25% Checkered Brown, 25% Plain Red, 25% Plain Brown. So the ratio is 75:25:25:25, which can be simplified by dividing each by 25, giving 3:1:1:1.\n\nNone of the options directly reflect this, except perhaps option G, which says 12:2:2:0, but that's 16 parts. Wait, maybe I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me reread the question.\n\nAh! Wait, the first parent is \"checkered red\" bird. In genetics, being checkered could imply that the alleles at the dominant locus are present in a way that creates a check pattern, but perhaps it's referring to the presence of the dominant allele, not the specific phenotype. So perhaps the checkered phenotype is due to having at least one dominant allele, not necessarily the exact pattern.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is \"plain brown,\" meaning they have both recessive alleles.\n\nSo, in terms of the genes, assuming that the checkered trait is expressed when at least one dominant allele is present, and brown when none are present.\n\nGiven that, the parents would be:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 dominant for checkered (so phenotype checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 recessive for both traits (phenotype plain brown)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nThe F2 would be a dihybrid cross, resulting in 9 possible genotypic classes, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment).\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none of them provide a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the closest is option H: 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, but our calculation shows 16 parts (9+something?), which doesn't add up correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the phenotypes. Let me list them again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Wait, no, because bb would be brown. So that's Brown.\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1,4,7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered Brown: 2,5,8 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain Red: 3,9 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Brown: 6,4 \u2192 Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the F2:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 three\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb \u2192 three\n- Plain Red: CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb \u2192 three\n- Plain Brown: cc bb \u2192 one? No, wait, cc bb is brown, but in the list above, I see cc BB is red. Wait, no, cc BB is red, cc Bb is brown, cc bb is brown, and cc BB is red. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,4,7 \u2192 3\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain Red: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: Cases 6,9? Wait, no. Case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown. So 2 cases.\n\nWait, that totals to 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10, but there are only 9 F2 individuals. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,4,7 \u2192 3\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain Red: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: Cases 6, 9? Wait, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, so only 2 cases.\n\nAdding up: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10. But there are only 9 individuals. Hmm, that indicates an error in counting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, case 6: Cc bb \u2192 brown\ncase 9: cc bb \u2192 brown\nThat's two cases for brown.\n\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 brown\ncase 9: cc bb \u2192 brown\nTotal brown: 2 (from cases 3,6,9?) Wait, no, each case is a distinct individual. So:\n\nCheckered Red: 3\nCheckered Brown: 3\nPlain Red: 2\nPlain Brown: 2\nTotal: 3+3+2+2=10, but there are only 9 individuals. This discrepancy suggests an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps case 3 is CC bb \u2192 brown, case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, and case 4 is Cc BB \u2192 red. So:\n\n- Red: 3 (cases 1,4,7)\n- Brown: 3 (cases 2,5,6,9?) Wait, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, so cases 2,5,6,9 \u2192 4 cases. That would make 7 red and 3 brown, totaling 10 again. Wait, no, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount each phenotype:\n\nCheckered Red: Cases 1,4,7 \u2192 3\nCheckered Brown: Cases 2,5,8 \u2192 3\nPlain Red: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2\nPlain Brown: Cases 6,9? Wait, case 9 is already counted under plain brown. Wait, case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown. So that's two cases for brown.\n\nSo total:\n\nRed: 3 + 2 = 5\nBrown: 3 + 2 = 5\nWait, that sums to 10, but there are only 9 F2 individuals. Clearly, I'm miscounting somewhere.\n\nAh, wait! Case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, but case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown. So that's two cases for brown, plus case 3 (CC bb) and case 9 (cc bb) for plain brown. So that's 4 cases for brown. Then, checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 2, plain brown is 4. Total is 3+3+2+4=12, which exceeds 9. Clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the counts. Let me try a different method:\n\nEach F2 individual has a 25% chance for each of the four possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Brown (brown)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,4,7 \u2192 3\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain Red: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: Cases 6,8,9 \u2192 Wait, no, case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown. So cases 6,8,9 \u2192 3.\n\nWait, that can't be right because case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, and case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown. So that's three cases for brown. But that would make:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Plain Red: 2\n- Plain Brown: 3\n\nTotal: 3+3+2+3=11, which is impossible. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nPerhaps the issue arises because some genotypes are identical, but in reality, each F2 individual is unique, so the counts should sum to 9.\n\nLet me list all nine:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 RR\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Rr\n3. CC bb \u2192 Rr\n4. Cc BB \u2192 RR\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Rr\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Rr\n7. cc BB \u2192 rr\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Rr\n9. cc bb \u2192 rr\n\nWait, no, scratch that. Each F2 individual has a unique genotype. So:\n\n1.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it carefully again.\n\nWe have two birds crossing, one that's a checkered red and another that's plain brown. The genes involved are C (dominant for checkered), c (recessive for plain), B (dominant for red), and b (recessive for brown). We need to create a Punnett square for an adi hybrid cross, which means each parent contributes two alleles. \n\nFirst, let me break down the parents:\n\nParent 1: Checkered red bird \u2192 genotype should be CC BB because checkered is dominant over plain, and red is dominant over brown. So both parents are homozygous for these traits.\n\nParent 2: Plain brown bird \u2192 genotype would be cc bb since plain is recessive and brown is also recessive.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the first parent says \"checkered red\" bird. Since checkered is dominant over plain, if it's checkered red, that suggests that the alleles at the C locus are present in such a way that the phenotype is checkered. But how exactly does checkered work? Hmm. Maybe it's just that the presence of the dominant allele makes it checkered. So Parent 1 is CC BB.\n\nParent 2 is plain brown \u2192 so they must be cc bb.\n\nNow, we're making an adi hybrid cross between these two. Adi hybrid usually refers to a cross where one parent is heterozygous for one trait and the other is homozygous recessive. Wait, but here both parents are homozygous. Wait, hold on\u2014no, actually, Parent 1 is CC BB, so he's homozygous for both dominant traits, and Parent 2 is cc bb, homozygous for both recessive traits. That can't form a dihybrid cross because dihybrid crosses involve heterozygotes.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says \"adihybridcross,\" but perhaps it's a typo or misnomer. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross involving two different pairs. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about dihybrid, but about a cross where each parent has two different alleles for each gene. Let me re-examine the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Genotype for C is CC, for B is BB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Genotype for C is cc, for B is bb.\n\nSo when they mate, the possible gametes from Parent 1 will be CB (since both C alleles are dominant), and from Parent 2, they'll be cb.\n\nSo the F1 would get one allele from each parent, so from Parent 1: C and B, from Parent 2: c and b. So the F1 genotypes would be Cc Bb.\n\nThen the F1s would self-fertilize to produce F2. So let's construct the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nThe F1 is Cc Bb. So the gametes from F1 would be:\n\n- From C locus: C and c.\n- From B locus: B and b.\n\nEach combination is equally likely, so four types: CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n\nThus, the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n1. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 for C locus: CC, Cc, cc.\n2. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 for B locus: BB, Bb, bb.\n\nSo the F2 would be a grid of all possible combinations, resulting in 9 squares.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles. Let's map them:\n\n- C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- c and B \u2192 Plain Red\n- c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio depends on how many of each genotype there are in the F2.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of CC = 25%\n- Cc = 50%\n- cc = 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- Probability of BB = 25%\n- Bb = 50%\n- bb = 25%\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied:\n\nCheckered Red: CC \u00d7 BB = 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 6 out of 100.\n\nCheckered Brown: CC \u00d7 Bb = 6.25% \u2192 6 out of 100.\n\nPlain Red: cc \u00d7 BB = 6.25% \u2192 6 out of 100.\n\nPlain Brown: cc \u00d7 Bb = 6.25% \u2192 6 out of 100.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps the question expects us to consider all possible phenotypes, including those not explicitly mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was incorrect. Let me double-check the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps Parent 1 is not CC BB but instead something else. Wait, the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird.\" So the alleles are dominant for checkered and red, implying that the bird has the dominant alleles for both traits. So yes, CC BB.\n\nParent 2 is \"plain brown bird.\" So their alleles are recessive: cc bb.\n\nThus, the cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nThe F2 would be a dihybrid cross, leading to 9 possible genotypic classes.\n\nSo, checking back:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC\n- CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc\n- etc., but more accurately, using Punnett squares.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The correct approach is to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio based on the genetic makeup.\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio for two linked or independent genes is typically 9:3:3:1, depending on whether they are linked or independent. If independent, then:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align. Option D mentions 1:3:9:3, which seems reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount.\n\nIf the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then all F2 individuals will be Cc Bb. Therefore, their genotypes are all the same, leading to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but that would mean all 9 F2 individuals are Checkered Red or Plain Red, depending on the alleles.\n\nWait, no, because in dihybrid crosses, the F2 includes all combinations, regardless of dominance. So:\n\n- For the C locus: CC, Cc, cc\n- For the B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo combining them gives:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Wait, no, because bb is brown, right?\n\nWait, no, wait. Because B is dominant for red, so bb would express brown. Similarly, Bb would express red.\n\nWait, but in this case, the F2 would include:\n\n- All individuals where C is dominant (C) and B is dominant (B): Checkered Red\n- All individuals where C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b): Checkered Brown\n- All individuals where C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B): Plain Red\n- All individuals where C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (b): Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: When either C or B is present\n- Checkered Brown: When C is present but B is absent\n- Plain Red: When C is absent but B is present\n- Plain Brown: When neither C nor B is present\n\nSo the number of each phenotype would correspond to the number of genotypic classes.\n\nIn the F2 cross, for each gene:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombined, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% + 50% = 75% \u2192 75 out of 100\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 25 out of 100\n- Plain Red: 25% \u2192 25 out of 100\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 25 out of 100\n\nSo the ratio would be 75:25:25:25, which simplifies to 3:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly give this. However, option H is 5:3:2:6, which isn't matching. Option J is 2:6:3:1, still not matching. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which adds up to 16, but the total should be 9. Hmm, I think I might be miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, because the actual numbers are 75% Checkered Red, 25% Checkered Brown, 25% Plain Red, 25% Plain Brown. So the ratio is 75:25:25:25, which can be simplified by dividing each by 25, giving 3:1:1:1.\n\nNone of the options directly reflect this, except perhaps option G, which says 12:2:2:0, but that's 16 parts. Wait, maybe I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me reread the question.\n\nAh! Wait, the first parent is \"checkered red\" bird. In genetics, being checkered could imply that the alleles at the dominant locus are present in a way that creates a check pattern, but perhaps it's referring to the presence of the dominant allele, not the specific phenotype. So perhaps the checkered phenotype is due to having at least one dominant allele, not necessarily the exact pattern.\n\nSimilarly, the second parent is \"plain brown,\" meaning they have both recessive alleles.\n\nSo, in terms of the genes, assuming that the checkered trait is expressed when at least one dominant allele is present, and brown when none are present.\n\nGiven that, the parents would be:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 dominant for checkered (so phenotype checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 recessive for both traits (phenotype plain brown)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be Cc Bb.\n\nThe F2 would be a dihybrid cross, resulting in 9 possible genotypic classes, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment).\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none of them provide a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the closest is option H: 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, but our calculation shows 16 parts (9+something?), which doesn't add up correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the phenotypes. Let me list them again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Wait, no, because bb would be brown. So that's Brown.\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1,4,7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered Brown: 2,5,8 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain Red: 3,9 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Brown: 6,4 \u2192 Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the F2:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB \u2192 three\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb \u2192 three\n- Plain Red: CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb \u2192 three\n- Plain Brown: cc bb \u2192 one? No, wait, cc bb is brown, but in the list above, I see cc BB is red. Wait, no, cc BB is red, cc Bb is brown, cc bb is brown, and cc BB is red. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,4,7 \u2192 3\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain Red: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: Cases 6,9? Wait, no. Case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown. So 2 cases.\n\nWait, that totals to 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10, but there are only 9 F2 individuals. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,4,7 \u2192 3\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain Red: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: Cases 6, 9? Wait, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, so only 2 cases.\n\nAdding up: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10. But there are only 9 individuals. Hmm, that indicates an error in counting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, case 6: Cc bb \u2192 brown\ncase 9: cc bb \u2192 brown\nThat's two cases for brown.\n\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 brown\ncase 9: cc bb \u2192 brown\nTotal brown: 2 (from cases 3,6,9?) Wait, no, each case is a distinct individual. So:\n\nCheckered Red: 3\nCheckered Brown: 3\nPlain Red: 2\nPlain Brown: 2\nTotal: 3+3+2+2=10, but there are only 9 individuals. This discrepancy suggests an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps case 3 is CC bb \u2192 brown, case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, and case 4 is Cc BB \u2192 red. So:\n\n- Red: 3 (cases 1,4,7)\n- Brown: 3 (cases 2,5,6,9?) Wait, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, so cases 2,5,6,9 \u2192 4 cases. That would make 7 red and 3 brown, totaling 10 again. Wait, no, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount each phenotype:\n\nCheckered Red: Cases 1,4,7 \u2192 3\nCheckered Brown: Cases 2,5,8 \u2192 3\nPlain Red: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2\nPlain Brown: Cases 6,9? Wait, case 9 is already counted under plain brown. Wait, case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown. So that's two cases for brown.\n\nSo total:\n\nRed: 3 + 2 = 5\nBrown: 3 + 2 = 5\nWait, that sums to 10, but there are only 9 F2 individuals. Clearly, I'm miscounting somewhere.\n\nAh, wait! Case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, but case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown. So that's two cases for brown, plus case 3 (CC bb) and case 9 (cc bb) for plain brown. So that's 4 cases for brown. Then, checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 2, plain brown is 4. Total is 3+3+2+4=12, which exceeds 9. Clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the counts. Let me try a different method:\n\nEach F2 individual has a 25% chance for each of the four possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Brown (brown)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,4,7 \u2192 3\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 2,5,8 \u2192 3\n- Plain Red: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: Cases 6,8,9 \u2192 Wait, no, case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown. So cases 6,8,9 \u2192 3.\n\nWait, that can't be right because case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 brown, case 9 is cc bb \u2192 brown, and case 6 is Cc bb \u2192 brown. So that's three cases for brown. But that would make:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Plain Red: 2\n- Plain Brown: 3\n\nTotal: 3+3+2+3=11, which is impossible. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nPerhaps the issue arises because some genotypes are identical, but in reality, each F2 individual is unique, so the counts should sum to 9.\n\nLet me list all nine:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 RR\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Rr\n3. CC bb \u2192 Rr\n4. Cc BB \u2192 RR\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Rr\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Rr\n7. cc BB \u2192 rr\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Rr\n9. cc bb \u2192 rr\n\nWait, no, scratch that. Each F2 individual has a unique genotype. So:\n\n1.",

    "rollout": " Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cross involves two birds: one that's homozygously checkered red (CCBB) and another that's plain brown (ccbb). I need to create a Punnett square for their offspring, specifically looking at the F2 generation. \n\nLet me start by figuring out the possible gametes each parent can produce. The first bird, CCBB, has two dominant alleles for both color genes (C and B), so it can only contribute the dominant alleles C and B to its offspring. The second bird, ccbb, has two recessive alleles for both color genes (c and b), so it can only contribute the recessive alleles c and b.\n\nNow, when these gametes combine, the F1 generation will consist of all combinations of C/B from the first parent and c/b from the second parent. So, the possible offspring will have the following genotype combinations:\n\n- Cc (from C and c)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nNext, for the F2 generation, we're considering an F1 x F1 cross. Since F1 is CcBb, each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, and cb. When these gametes combine, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from C + C)\n- Cc (from C + c or c + C)\n- cC (same as Cc)\n- cc (from c + c)\n- BB (from B + B)\n- Bb (from B + b or b + B)\n- bB (same as Bb)\n- bb (from b + b)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will include CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, and bb.\n\nNow, let's map these genotypes to phenotypes based on the given traits. The dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. So:\n\n- CC or Cc will express both C and B, making them checkered.\n- Cc or Cc (wait, actually, since both parents are Cc, the offspring could be CC, Cc, or cc. Wait no, in F1 CcBb, each parent can give either C or c for the first gene and B or b for the second. So combining Cc x Cc gives CC, Cc, or cc for each gene. Similarly for Bb x Bb gives BB, Bb, or bb. So F2 genotypes will have combinations of these.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Each parent is CcBb, so when they self-fertilize, the segregation follows independent assortment, so each gene is independently assorting.\n\nFor the F2 population, the phenotypic ratios depend on how many individuals express what traits.\n\nLet me consider each trait separately:\n\n- Checkered (expressing both C and B): This occurs when neither allele is recessive. So, for each gene:\n  - For the first gene (C and c), not cc.\n  - For the second gene (B and b), not bb.\n  \nBut wait, in the F2, each gene segregates independently, so the probability of not being recessive for each gene is (3/4), but since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. However, some of these might overlap if both genes are recessive. But in reality, the total number expressing both dominant traits would be the sum of those who are CC, Cc, cC, or Cc? Wait no, because the dominant traits are expressed regardless of the other gene. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the actual counts.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no, that's for a dihybrid cross where each gene is independently assorting and dominant traits are expressed. But in our case, the genes are linked? Or are they independent?\n\nWait, the problem states that the traits are determined by dominant and recessive alleles, but doesn't mention linkage. So I think it's safe to assume independence unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, the dihybrid cross with two dominant traits would result in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But let me verify:\n\nThe possible phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red: C_B_ \u2192 (C and B dominant) \u2192 phenotype is red and brown (since B is dominant over b).\n2. Checkered brown: C_bb \u2192 phenotype is red and brown (but B is present as dominant).\n3. Plain red: ccBB \u2192 phenotype is red (no B present).\n4. Plain brown: ccbb \u2192 phenotype is brown (no C present).\n\nWait, no. Because in the F2, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So if both C and B are present, the animal is checkered. If only C is present, it's red. Only B is present, it's brown. Neither is present, it's brown.\n\nWait, but the initial problem says \"red\" is C_B_, and \"brown\" is c_bb. So, any presence of C or B results in red pigment, and any presence of c or b results in brown. Therefore, the phenotype depends on whether the animal has at least one dominant allele for each color gene.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered red.\n2. Either C or B present: Checkered red or brown?\nWait, no. If an animal has at least one dominant allele for each color, then it's checkered. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nWait, correction: An animal is checkered if it has at least one dominant allele for both color genes. It's plain if it lacks at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, checking each possibility:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered red.\n- C_bb: Checkered brown.\n- ccBB: Plain red.\n- ccbb: Plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_\n- Checkered brown: C_bb\n- Plain red: ccBB\n- Plain brown: ccbb\n\nNow, calculating the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross with independent genes, the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1. So, total parts = 16.\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_) : 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (C_bb) : 3 parts\n- Plain red (ccBB) : 3 parts\n- Plain brown (ccbb) : 1 part\n\nWait, but in the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6+2=8, 6+2=8 \u2192 8:8 \u2192 same ratio, which doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 simplifies to 2:1:0:1, which isn't matching.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 matches the calculation.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No, reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, reversed.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, which isn't the case here.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16, but 12+2=14, etc., which doesn't align.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not the same.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Not the same.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16.\n\nK. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Same issue as G.\n\nL. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nM. 16,0,0,0 \u2192 No.\n\nN. 0,0,0,0 \u2192 No.\n\nO. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Reversed E.\n\nSo, the correct answer seems to be option C, which is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown.

I need to create a Punnett square for their offspring, specifically looking at the F2 generation. \n\nLet me start by figuring out the possible gametes each parent can produce.

When these gametes combine, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from C + C)\n- Cc (from C + c or c + C)\n- cC (same as Cc)\n- cc (from c + c)\n- BB (from B + B)\n- Bb (from B + b or b + B)\n- bB (same as Bb)\n- bb (from b + b)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will include CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, and bb.\n\nNow, let's map these genotypes to phenotypes based on the given traits. The dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. So:\n\n- CC or Cc will express both C and B, making them checkered.\n- Cc or Cc (wait, actually, since both parents are Cc, the offspring could be CC, Cc, or cc. Wait no, in F1 CcBb, each parent can give either C or c for the first gene and B or b for the second. So combining Cc x Cc gives CC, Cc, or cc for each gene. Similarly for Bb x Bb gives BB, Bb, or bb. So F2 genotypes will have combinations of these.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Each parent is CcBb, so when they self-fertilize, the segregation follows independent assortment, so each gene is independently assorting.\n\nFor the F2 population, the phenotypic ratios depend on how many individuals express what traits.\n\nLet me consider each trait separately:\n\n- Checkered (expressing both C and B): This occurs when neither allele is recessive. So, for each gene:\n  - For the first gene (C and c), not cc.\n  - For the second gene (B and b), not bb.\n  \nBut wait, in the F2, each gene segregates independently, so the probability of not being recessive for each gene is (3/4), but since the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. However, some of these might overlap if both genes are recessive. But in reality, the total number expressing both dominant traits would be the sum of those who are CC, Cc, cC, or Cc? Wait no, because the dominant traits are expressed regardless of the other gene. Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the actual counts.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, no, that's for a dihybrid cross where each gene is independently assorting and dominant traits are expressed. But in our case, the genes are linked? Or are they independent?\n\nWait, the problem states that the traits are determined by dominant and recessive alleles, but doesn't mention linkage. So I think it's safe to assume independence unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, the dihybrid cross with two dominant traits would result in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But let me verify:\n\nThe possible phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered red: C_B_ \u2192 (C and B dominant) \u2192 phenotype is red and brown (since B is dominant over b).\n2. Checkered brown: C_bb \u2192 phenotype is red and brown (but B is present as dominant).\n3. Plain red: ccBB \u2192 phenotype is red (no B present).\n4. Plain brown: ccbb \u2192 phenotype is brown (no C present).\n\nWait, no. Because in the F2, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So if both C and B are present, the animal is checkered. If only C is present, it's red. Only B is present, it's brown. Neither is present, it's brown.\n\nWait, but the initial problem says \"red\" is C_B_, and \"brown\" is c_bb. So, any presence of C or B results in red pigment, and any presence of c or b results in brown. Therefore, the phenotype depends on whether the animal has at least one dominant allele for each color gene.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered red.\n2. Either C or B present: Checkered red or brown?\nWait, no. If an animal has at least one dominant allele for each color, then it's checkered. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nWait, correction: An animal is checkered if it has at least one dominant allele for both color genes. It's plain if it lacks at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, checking each possibility:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered red.\n- C_bb: Checkered brown.\n- ccBB: Plain red.\n- ccbb: Plain brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_\n- Checkered brown: C_bb\n- Plain red: ccBB\n- Plain brown: ccbb\n\nNow, calculating the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross with independent genes, the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1. So, total parts = 16.\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_) : 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (C_bb) : 3 parts\n- Plain red (ccBB) : 3 parts\n- Plain brown (ccbb) : 1 part\n\nWait, but in the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6+2=8, 6+2=8 \u2192 8:8 \u2192 same ratio, which doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8+4+0+4=16 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 simplifies to 2:1:0:1, which isn't matching.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 matches the calculation.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No, reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, reversed.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, which isn't the case here.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16, but 12+2=14, etc., which doesn't align.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not the same.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Not the same.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16.\n\nK. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Same issue as G.\n\nL. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nM. 16,0,0,0 \u2192 No.\n\nN. 0,0,0,0 \u2192 No.\n\nO. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Reversed E.\n\nSo, the correct answer seems to be option C, which is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Looking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

One bird is a parent who is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means they have the genotype CC BB. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so that's cc bb. We need to create a Punnett square for an adihybridcross between these two parents. Then, we have to determine the phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the information given:\n\n- Gene C controls the checkered pattern. The dominant allele C results in a checkered pattern, while the recessive allele c results in plain color.\n- Gene B determines red or brown color. The dominant allele B produces red, and the recessive allele b gives brown.\n  \nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. Since both parents are homozygous for one gene but heterozygous for the other, their offspring will exhibit certain combinations.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the possible gametes each parent can produce.\n\nFor the parent with CC BB:\n- They can only give the C allele because both alleles are C. So, all gametes will be CB.\n\nFor the parent with cc bb:\n- They can only give the c allele because both alleles are c. So, all gametes will be cb.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you're creating a Punnett square, you consider all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent. But since each parent here can only provide one type of gamete due to being homozygous, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. If the parent is CC BB, then any gamete they produce would carry the C and B alleles. Similarly, the other parent is cc bb, so all gametes would carry c and b. Therefore, the F1 generation would be all combinations of CB and cb, making four types: CB, CB, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right either. Because each parent contributes one allele per gene, the F1 should be a combination of C and c for gene C, and B and b for gene B.\n\nBut wait, if the first parent is CC BB, meaning they're homozygous for both genes, then any gamete they produce must carry both alleles for those genes\u2014so for gene C, they can only contribute C, and for gene B, they can only contribute B. Similarly, the second parent is cc bb, so they can only contribute c and b respectively.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these alleles. That is, for gene C, it's either C or c, but since the parent is homozygous, it's always C. Wait, no\u2014the parent is CC BB, so each gene is homozygous, meaning they can only pass C and B alleles. Similarly, the other parent is cc bb, so they can only pass c and b. Therefore, the F1 will have CC BB as the only possibility? No, that can't be right because that's the parent themselves. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nNo, actually, each bird is a diploid individual, so for each gene, they have two alleles. The first parent is CC BB, so for gene C, they have CC, and for gene B, they have BB. The second parent is cc bb, so for gene C, they have cc, and for gene B, they have bb. When they mate, each parent will contribute one allele for each gene.\n\nSo, for gene C, the parent with CC BB can only contribute C. The other parent can only contribute c. Therefore, all F1 birds will have the genotype Cc for gene C. Similarly, for gene B, the first parent contributes B, and the second contributes b, so all F1 birds will have genotype Bb.\n\nWait, but the initial statement says the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the F1 would be Cc Bb. Wait, no\u2014if each parent can only give one allele, then the F1 would be Cc Bb. But the question mentions F1 as CcBb and then goes into F2. Hmm, perhaps my earlier approach was incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F1 is generated by considering the possible gametes from each parent. Since the first parent is CC BB, they can only give C and B. The second parent is cc bb, so they can only give c and b. Therefore, each F1 bird will receive one allele for each gene from each parent. So, for gene C, each bird gets either C or c, but since the first parent can only give C and the second can only give c, the only possibility is Cc. Similarly, for gene B, each bird gets either B or b, so the only possibility is Bb. Therefore, the F1 bird is Cc Bb, and all F1s are identical.\n\nThen, the F2 generation comes from the F1 parents. Each F1 bird is Cc Bb, so they can produce gametes that are a combination of Cc and Bb. Using a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\n- First gene (C):\n  - Parent A: Cc (so gametes: C and c)\n  - Parent B: Cc (same)\n- Second gene (B):\n  - Parent A: Bb (gametes: B and b)\n  - Parent B: Bb (same)\n\nSo, the F2 would have:\n\n- For gene C: CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 simplified to CC, Cc, cc\n- For gene B: BB, Bb, bB, bb \u2192 same as above\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the combination of these genes. The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered pattern (C) and red color (B): Checkered red (RR)\n- Checkered pattern (C) and brown color (bB): Checkered brown (Rr)\n- Plain color (cc) and red color (B): Plain red (rr)\n- Plain color (cc) and brown color (bB): Plain brown (rrBb)\n\nWait, but Rr is a middle phenotype between RR and rr, but in this case, since the birds are just expressed as either red or brown, and checkered as either plain or colored, perhaps the phenotypes are simply categories without intermediate classes. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypes are more about the presence of dominant traits rather than exact colors.\n\nWait, looking back at the question: It says \"red color\" is controlled by B, and \"brown color\" by b. So, each bird has two alleles for color, and if at least one is dominant, it shows the corresponding color. For pattern, C is dominant, so plain is c.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: Cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: cc Bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the options given. Let's see what each option suggests:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 1+3+9+3=16, which is too high because the total number of F2 individuals isn't specified. Wait, but actually, in a dihybrid cross, the number of F2 individuals depends on the parents' contribution. But perhaps the question assumes that the F2 refers to the actual number of birds produced, regardless of dominance. However, typically, dihybrid crosses result in 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014in a standard dihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where each category corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits for both genes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Total 16.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Total 16.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 12.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Total 16.\n\nIn a typical dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 for one phenotype, 3 for another, etc., totaling 16. None of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1, except perhaps none do. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. Looking at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Total 16. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. 5+3+2+6=16. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: sum is 12, which might be half.\n\nOption E: sum is 16, but the distribution is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the F2 phenotypes. Let me re-examine that.\n\nEach F2 bird has two alleles for gene C and two for gene B. The phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (checkered) and B is present (red).\n\nSo, possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (Cc Bb): 25% of F2\n2. Checkered brown (Cc Bb): 25%\n3. Plain red (cc BB): 25%\n4. Plain brown (cc Bb): 25%\n\nSo, the ratio should be 25% each, but the options don't exactly match this. Instead, the options suggest different distributions. Perhaps I've misinterpreted the cross setup.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would come from F1 x F1.\n\nEarlier analysis suggested that F2 would have 25% each of the four phenotypes. But perhaps the question is considering the phenotypes based on whether the animal is checkered or plain, and red or brown.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: the F2 will have:\n\n- All checkered (since C is dominant), so either checkered red or checkered brown.\n- All plain (since c is recessive), so either plain red or plain brown.\n\nWithin checkered, the color is determined by B (dominant) or b (recessive):\n\n- Checkered red (B present)\n- Checkered brown (b present)\n\nSimilarly, within plain, the color is determined by B (red) or b (brown):\n\n- Plain red (B present)\n- Plain brown (b present)\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the options are referring to the number of birds, assuming each bird is equally likely, but perhaps the question is considering only the checkered vs plain as separate groups and red vs brown as separate groups, leading to 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype separately.\n\nFor checkered (C present):\n\n- Red (B present): probability = (probability of B) * (probability of C) + (probability of recessive B) * (probability of C recessive)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to compute using the Punnett square.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities multiply:\n\nFor C:\n\n- C occurs in 75% (CC and Cc)\n- c occurs in 25% (cc)\n\nFor B:\n\n- B occurs in 75% (BB and Bb)\n- b occurs in 25% (bb)\n\nSo, the phenotypes for checkered are:\n\n- Both C and B: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- C and b: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- c and B: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- c and b: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSumming up:\n\nCheckered red: 56.25%\nCheckered brown: 18.75% + 18.75% = 37.5%\nPlain red: 6.25%\nPlain brown: 0% (since c is plain, but brown is b, which isn't possible if c is present?)\n\nWait, no, because if a bird is plain (cc), its color cannot be brown (b). So, the only plain color is when both alleles are c (cc), but color is determined by B. So, a plain bird could still be brown only if it's cc bb and B is present. Wait, no\u2014wait, the color determination is separate. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird is plain (cc), then its color is determined solely by the presence of B. Since B is recessive, the bird would be plain regardless of B. But wait, no\u2014if the bird is plain (cc), it means it's not showing the checkered pattern. Its color is determined by B. So, if B is present, it's red; otherwise, it's brown. But since cc is plain, it can't have B (because B is recessive). Therefore, a plain bird would always be brown, unless it's cc and has B. Wait, no\u2014a bird that's plain (cc) cannot have B because B is recessive, so it would always be brown.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered pattern (C) is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele is checkered.\n- Checkered red (CR) requires at least one C and one B allele.\n- Checkered brown (CB) requires at least one C and one b allele.\n- Plain (cc) means both alleles are c, so the color is determined by B.\n  - If B is present (at least one B allele), the bird is red (CR).\n  - If B is absent (which can't happen here because the bird is cc), it would be brown (CB). But since the bird is already plain (cc), it can't have B, so it would be brown.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, for a plain bird (cc), their color is determined by B:\n\n- CR (checkered red): requires at least one B allele. But since the bird is cc, there are no B alleles. So, a plain bird can never be CR. It must be CB, which is brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Let me rephrase:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. For gene B, the presence of a dominant B allele leads to red color, and a recessive b allele leads to brown color. So, for a bird that is plain (cc), regardless of B, it's brown because the B allele is recessive. Therefore, a plain bird cannot be CR; it must be CB, and thus brown.\n\nThat changes things. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CR: Checkered red (C present and B present)\n- CB: Checkered brown (C present and b present)\n- CB: Plain brown (cc and B present)\n- CR: Wait, no\u2014that's not possible. Wait, correction: If a bird is plain (cc), their color is determined by B. If B is present, it's red; if not, it's brown. But since the bird is cc, B is not present, so they are brown. So, a plain bird is CB, brown.\n\nWait, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. CR: Checkered red (C and B present)\n2. CB: Checkered brown (C and b present)\n3. CB: Plain brown (cc and B present)\n4. CR: Wait, no, because if a bird is plain (cc), it can't be CR; it's CB, brown.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- CR: 25%\n- CB: 50% (because 25% for CR, 25% for CB, 25% for CB, 25% for CR?) Wait, no\u2014actually, the Punnett square for F2 would produce four combinations: CR, CB, CB, CR. But since some phenotypes may overlap, I need to count correctly.\n\nWait, let's use the Punnett square properly.\n\nParental cross: CC BB (C c? No, wait, no\u2014parents are CC BB and cc bb. So, the F1 would be Cc Bb. Then, F1 x F1 would produce the following F2:\n\nFor gene C (from CC BB): each parent can contribute C or c. So, possible gametes: C (25%) and c (75%).\n\nFor gene B (from cc bb): each parent can contribute B or b. So, possible gametes: B (25%) and b (75%).\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F2:\n\n- C c \u00d7 C c: Gene C: CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 Simplified to CC, Cc, cc\n- B b \u00d7 B b: Gene B: BB, Bb, bB, bb \u2192 Simplified to BB, Bb, bb\n\nNow, combining them:\n\nEach combination of C and B will lead to a particular phenotype.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's nine possible combinations, but some will combine. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm overcomplicating. In reality, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (CR, red)\n- ",

One bird is a parent who is a homozygous checkered red bird, which means they have the genotype CC BB. The other parent is a plain brown bird, so that's cc bb. We need to create a Punnett square for an adihybridcross between these two parents. Then, we have to determine the phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation based on the options provided.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the information given:\n\n- Gene C controls the checkered pattern. The dominant allele C results in a checkered pattern, while the recessive allele c results in plain color.\n- Gene B determines red or brown color. The dominant allele B produces red, and the recessive allele b gives brown.\n  \nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. Since both parents are homozygous for one gene but heterozygous for the other, their offspring will exhibit certain combinations.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the possible gametes each parent can produce.\n\nFor the parent with CC BB:\n- They can only give the C allele because both alleles are C. So, all gametes will be CB.\n\nFor the parent with cc bb:\n- They can only give the c allele because both alleles are c. So, all gametes will be cb.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you're creating a Punnett square, you consider all possible combinations of the alleles from each parent. But since each parent here can only provide one type of gamete due to being homozygous, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. If the parent is CC BB, then any gamete they produce would carry the C and B alleles. Similarly, the other parent is cc bb, so all gametes would carry c and b. Therefore, the F1 generation would be all combinations of CB and cb, making four types: CB, CB, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right either. Because each parent contributes one allele per gene, the F1 should be a combination of C and c for gene C, and B and b for gene B.\n\nBut wait, if the first parent is CC BB, meaning they're homozygous for both genes, then any gamete they produce must carry both alleles for those genes\u2014so for gene C, they can only contribute C, and for gene B, they can only contribute B. Similarly, the second parent is cc bb, so they can only contribute c and b respectively.\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will consist of all possible combinations of these alleles. That is, for gene C, it's either C or c, but since the parent is homozygous, it's always C. Wait, no\u2014the parent is CC BB, so each gene is homozygous, meaning they can only pass C and B alleles. Similarly, the other parent is cc bb, so they can only pass c and b. Therefore, the F1 will have CC BB as the only possibility? No, that can't be right because that's the parent themselves. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nNo, actually, each bird is a diploid individual, so for each gene, they have two alleles. The first parent is CC BB, so for gene C, they have CC, and for gene B, they have BB. The second parent is cc bb, so for gene C, they have cc, and for gene B, they have bb. When they mate, each parent will contribute one allele for each gene.\n\nSo, for gene C, the parent with CC BB can only contribute C. The other parent can only contribute c. Therefore, all F1 birds will have the genotype Cc for gene C. Similarly, for gene B, the first parent contributes B, and the second contributes b, so all F1 birds will have genotype Bb.\n\nWait, but the initial statement says the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the F1 would be Cc Bb. Wait, no\u2014if each parent can only give one allele, then the F1 would be Cc Bb. But the question mentions F1 as CcBb and then goes into F2. Hmm, perhaps my earlier approach was incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F1 is generated by considering the possible gametes from each parent. Since the first parent is CC BB, they can only give C and B. The second parent is cc bb, so they can only give c and b. Therefore, each F1 bird will receive one allele for each gene from each parent. So, for gene C, each bird gets either C or c, but since the first parent can only give C and the second can only give c, the only possibility is Cc. Similarly, for gene B, each bird gets either B or b, so the only possibility is Bb. Therefore, the F1 bird is Cc Bb, and all F1s are identical.\n\nThen, the F2 generation comes from the F1 parents. Each F1 bird is Cc Bb, so they can produce gametes that are a combination of Cc and Bb. Using a Punnett square for F1 x F1:\n\n- First gene (C):\n  - Parent A: Cc (so gametes: C and c)\n  - Parent B: Cc (same)\n- Second gene (B):\n  - Parent A: Bb (gametes: B and b)\n  - Parent B: Bb (same)\n\nSo, the F2 would have:\n\n- For gene C: CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 simplified to CC, Cc, cc\n- For gene B: BB, Bb, bB, bb \u2192 same as above\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the combination of these genes. The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered pattern (C) and red color (B): Checkered red (RR)\n- Checkered pattern (C) and brown color (bB): Checkered brown (Rr)\n- Plain color (cc) and red color (B): Plain red (rr)\n- Plain color (cc) and brown color (bB): Plain brown (rrBb)\n\nWait, but Rr is a middle phenotype between RR and rr, but in this case, since the birds are just expressed as either red or brown, and checkered as either plain or colored, perhaps the phenotypes are simply categories without intermediate classes. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypes are more about the presence of dominant traits rather than exact colors.\n\nWait, looking back at the question: It says \"red color\" is controlled by B, and \"brown color\" by b. So, each bird has two alleles for color, and if at least one is dominant, it shows the corresponding color. For pattern, C is dominant, so plain is c.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: Cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: cc Bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the options given. Let's see what each option suggests:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 1+3+9+3=16, which is too high because the total number of F2 individuals isn't specified. Wait, but actually, in a dihybrid cross, the number of F2 individuals depends on the parents' contribution. But perhaps the question assumes that the F2 refers to the actual number of birds produced, regardless of dominance. However, typically, dihybrid crosses result in 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014in a standard dihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where each category corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits for both genes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Total 16.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Total 16.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Total 12.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Total 16.\n\nIn a typical dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 for one phenotype, 3 for another, etc., totaling 16. None of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1, except perhaps none do. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. Looking at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Total 16. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. 5+3+2+6=16. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: sum is 12, which might be half.\n\nOption E: sum is 16, but the distribution is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the F2 phenotypes. Let me re-examine that.\n\nEach F2 bird has two alleles for gene C and two for gene B. The phenotypes are determined by whether C is present (checkered) and B is present (red).\n\nSo, possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (Cc Bb): 25% of F2\n2. Checkered brown (Cc Bb): 25%\n3. Plain red (cc BB): 25%\n4. Plain brown (cc Bb): 25%\n\nSo, the ratio should be 25% each, but the options don't exactly match this. Instead, the options suggest different distributions. Perhaps I've misinterpreted the cross setup.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup, the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So, the F1 would be Cc Bb, and the F2 would come from F1 x F1.\n\nEarlier analysis suggested that F2 would have 25% each of the four phenotypes. But perhaps the question is considering the phenotypes based on whether the animal is checkered or plain, and red or brown.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: the F2 will have:\n\n- All checkered (since C is dominant), so either checkered red or checkered brown.\n- All plain (since c is recessive), so either plain red or plain brown.\n\nWithin checkered, the color is determined by B (dominant) or b (recessive):\n\n- Checkered red (B present)\n- Checkered brown (b present)\n\nSimilarly, within plain, the color is determined by B (red) or b (brown):\n\n- Plain red (B present)\n- Plain brown (b present)\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the options are referring to the number of birds, assuming each bird is equally likely, but perhaps the question is considering only the checkered vs plain as separate groups and red vs brown as separate groups, leading to 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype separately.\n\nFor checkered (C present):\n\n- Red (B present): probability = (probability of B) * (probability of C) + (probability of recessive B) * (probability of C recessive)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to compute using the Punnett square.\n\nSince each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities multiply:\n\nFor C:\n\n- C occurs in 75% (CC and Cc)\n- c occurs in 25% (cc)\n\nFor B:\n\n- B occurs in 75% (BB and Bb)\n- b occurs in 25% (bb)\n\nSo, the phenotypes for checkered are:\n\n- Both C and B: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- C and b: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- c and B: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- c and b: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSumming up:\n\nCheckered red: 56.25%\nCheckered brown: 18.75% + 18.75% = 37.5%\nPlain red: 6.25%\nPlain brown: 0% (since c is plain, but brown is b, which isn't possible if c is present?)\n\nWait, no, because if a bird is plain (cc), its color cannot be brown (b). So, the only plain color is when both alleles are c (cc), but color is determined by B. So, a plain bird could still be brown only if it's cc bb and B is present. Wait, no\u2014wait, the color determination is separate. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird is plain (cc), then its color is determined solely by the presence of B. Since B is recessive, the bird would be plain regardless of B. But wait, no\u2014if the bird is plain (cc), it means it's not showing the checkered pattern. Its color is determined by B. So, if B is present, it's red; otherwise, it's brown. But since cc is plain, it can't have B (because B is recessive). Therefore, a plain bird would always be brown, unless it's cc and has B. Wait, no\u2014a bird that's plain (cc) cannot have B because B is recessive, so it would always be brown.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered pattern (C) is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele is checkered.\n- Checkered red (CR) requires at least one C and one B allele.\n- Checkered brown (CB) requires at least one C and one b allele.\n- Plain (cc) means both alleles are c, so the color is determined by B.\n  - If B is present (at least one B allele), the bird is red (CR).\n  - If B is absent (which can't happen here because the bird is cc), it would be brown (CB). But since the bird is already plain (cc), it can't have B, so it would be brown.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, for a plain bird (cc), their color is determined by B:\n\n- CR (checkered red): requires at least one B allele. But since the bird is cc, there are no B alleles. So, a plain bird can never be CR. It must be CB, which is brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Let me rephrase:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. For gene B, the presence of a dominant B allele leads to red color, and a recessive b allele leads to brown color. So, for a bird that is plain (cc), regardless of B, it's brown because the B allele is recessive. Therefore, a plain bird cannot be CR; it must be CB, and thus brown.\n\nThat changes things. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CR: Checkered red (C present and B present)\n- CB: Checkered brown (C present and b present)\n- CB: Plain brown (cc and B present)\n- CR: Wait, no\u2014that's not possible. Wait, correction: If a bird is plain (cc), their color is determined by B. If B is present, it's red; if not, it's brown. But since the bird is cc, B is not present, so they are brown. So, a plain bird is CB, brown.\n\nWait, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. CR: Checkered red (C and B present)\n2. CB: Checkered brown (C and b present)\n3. CB: Plain brown (cc and B present)\n4. CR: Wait, no, because if a bird is plain (cc), it can't be CR; it's CB, brown.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- CR: 25%\n- CB: 50% (because 25% for CR, 25% for CB, 25% for CB, 25% for CR?) Wait, no\u2014actually, the Punnett square for F2 would produce four combinations: CR, CB, CB, CR. But since some phenotypes may overlap, I need to count correctly.\n\nWait, let's use the Punnett square properly.\n\nParental cross: CC BB (C c? No, wait, no\u2014parents are CC BB and cc bb. So, the F1 would be Cc Bb. Then, F1 x F1 would produce the following F2:\n\nFor gene C (from CC BB): each parent can contribute C or c. So, possible gametes: C (25%) and c (75%).\n\nFor gene B (from cc bb): each parent can contribute B or b. So, possible gametes: B (25%) and b (75%).\n\nUsing a Punnett square for F2:\n\n- C c \u00d7 C c: Gene C: CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 Simplified to CC, Cc, cc\n- B b \u00d7 B b: Gene B: BB, Bb, bB, bb \u2192 Simplified to BB, Bb, bb\n\nNow, combining them:\n\nEach combination of C and B will lead to a particular phenotype.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's nine possible combinations, but some will combine. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm overcomplicating. In reality, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (CR, red)\n- ",

    "chunk_resampled": "Let me read it again carefully.",
    "rollout": " Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds: one that's homozygously checkered red (CCBB) and another that's plain brown (ccbb). We need to create a Punnett square for their offspring and determine the phenotypic ratios based on the given options.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the genes involved. There are two genes here: one for the color pattern (B and b) and one for the dominance in the pattern (C and c). \n\nThe parent birds are:\n- Homozygous Checkered Red: CC BB\n- Plain Brown: cc bb\n\nSo when they mate, each bird will produce gametes. Since CCBB is homozygous, all its gametes should be CB. Similarly, ccbb is homozygous, so all its gametes should be cb. This makes sense because both parents are homozygous for their respective alleles.\n\nNow, if we have two CcBB parent birds crossing, the possible gametes from each would be CB, Cb, cB, and cb. But wait, since both parents are CCBB and ccbb, the gametes from each parent are all CB and cb respectively. So when they combine, the F1 generation would get one gamete from each parent. Therefore, the F1 should be CcBB (from CB), CcBb (from CB and cb?), no\u2014wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If both parents are heterozygous for both traits, then the F1 would be Cc for the first gene (since it's the dominant one) and Bb for the second gene? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the F1 generation comes from combining the gametes of CCBB and ccbb. Since CCBB can only make CB gametes and ccbb can only make cb gametes, the F1 would consist of four combinations: CB and cb. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each bird produces four types of gametes, but both parents contribute two different gametes each, leading to four F1 offspring.\n\nBut in reality, each bird contributes two gametes, so when you pair them, you get four possible combinations. So the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CB x cb: CB + cb = CcBb?\nWait, no. Let me clarify: Each bird has two alleles, so the F1 would be the combination of one allele from each parent. Since CCBB gives CB, and ccbb gives cb, the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb?\n\nNo, wait, let me do it properly. Each bird contributes one allele to the offspring. So from CCBB, it can give either C or B. From ccbb, it can give either c or b. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- C (from CCBB) + c (from ccbb) = Cc\n- C (from CCBB) + b (from ccbb) = Cb\n- B (from CCBB) + c (from ccbb) = Bc\n- B (from CCBB) + b (from ccbb) = Bb\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because each bird has two pairs of alleles. Let me correct that.\n\nEach parent is CCBB and ccbb. When crossed, each bird will produce two types of gametes: from CCBB, it can produce CB gametes, and from ccbb, it can produce cb gametes. So the F1 generation would be the combination of these gametes. Since each bird contributes one gamete, the F1 would be:\n\n- CB from one parent and cb from the other: CB + cb = CcBb\n- CB from one and CB from the other: same as above.\nWait, no\u2014that's not how it works. Each bird contributes one gamete, so the F1 would have the following possible combinations:\n\nFrom the first bird (CCBB): CB or CB (but since it's homozygous, both are CB)\nFrom the second bird (ccbb): cb or cb (both are cb)\n\nSo the F1 will be:\n\n- CB (from CCBB) and cb (from ccbb) \u2192 CcBb\n- CB (from CCBB) and cb (from ccbb) \u2192 CcBb\nSimilarly, the other bird could also produce CB and cb, but since each bird only produces one gamete, each F1 individual gets one gamete from each parent.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually more accurate to say that each F1 individual receives one allele from each parent. So each parent contributes one allele per gene. So for the first gene (C/c), since one parent is CC and the other is cc, each F1 will receive C from the first parent and c from the second. For the second gene (B/b), since one parent is BB and the other is bb, each F1 will receive B from the first parent and b from the second. Therefore, all F1 individuals are CcBb.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Because if the parents are CCBB (homozygous) and ccbb (homozygous), then any F1 offspring must inherit CC from one parent and cc from the other. Wait, no\u2014the parents are each homozygous for both traits. So each parent is CC BB, meaning both alleles for C are C, and both for B are B. Similarly, the other parent is cc bb, so both alleles for c are c, and both for b are b.\n\nWhen they mate, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C, each parent contributes C (from CCBB) or C (since both are C). Similarly, for gene B, each parent contributes B (from BB) or B (from bb). Wait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB and ccbb, so each parent has two Cs and two Bs for the first gene, and two cs and two bs for the second gene.\n\nTherefore, each F1 offspring will have one allele for each gene from each parent. So for gene C, each parent contributes either C or C (since both are C), and for gene B, each parent contributes either B or B (since both are B). Thus, all F1 offspring will be CcBb.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let me correct that. Each parent is CC BB, which means for gene C, both alleles are C, and for gene B, both are B. Similarly, the other parent is cc bb, so for gene c, both are c, and for gene b, both are b.\n\nThus, each F1 offspring will receive one allele for each gene from each parent. So for gene C, each parent contributes either C (from CCBB) or C (since both are C). Similarly, for gene B, each parent contributes either B (from BB) or B (since both are B). Therefore, all F1 offspring will be CcBb.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the idea of F1 being CcBb. However, considering that each parent can only contribute C and B, and c and b, respectively, the F1 would indeed be CcBb.\n\nBut let me confirm this because sometimes when both parents are homozygous, the F1 can be different. Wait, no\u2014in this case, each parent is homozygous for both traits, so all F1 will inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Therefore, all F1 offspring will be CcBb.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions an F2 generation, so perhaps the initial step was wrong. Maybe the parents aren't both homozygous for both traits. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nAh, wait\u2014the parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). Both are homozygous for both traits. So each parent is homozygous for both genes, meaning that all their gametes carry both alleles for each gene. Therefore, the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, when they self-pollinate (which isn't mentioned yet), the F1 becomes F2. But according to the question, we're supposed to look at the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So the parents are CCBB and ccbb, but we need to consider their F2 generation.\n\nWait, but usually, when you cross two homozygous parents, all the F1 are the same genotype, and then the F2 would come from those F1 parents. But since the F1 are all CcBb, their offspring would be CcBb x CcBb, resulting in CcBb x CcBb, leading to F2 with various genotypes and phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, and when crossed, the F1 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, leading to F2.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question specifies a dihybrid cross where one parent is homozygous checkered red (CCBB) and the other is plain brown (ccbb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and then the F2 would be generated from F1 parents. So yes, the F2 would come from F1 parents.\n\nSo, now, the F2 generation would consist of F1 x F1, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The Punnett square for this cross would result in the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc for gene C, and Bb \u00d7 Bb for gene B.\n\nFor each gene, the possible gametes are C and c for gene C, and B and b for gene B.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypic ratios would be:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios would be the product of these probabilities.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about phenotypic ratios, not the genotypic ones. So we need to map the genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nGiven the traits:\n\n- Dominant alleles for color (B and b) lead to red or brown pigmentation.\n- Dominant alleles for pattern (C and c) lead to checkered or plain patterns.\n\nAssuming that both genes are acting independently:\n\nPhenotype for color:\n\n- If B is present (either dominant), the bird is red.\n- If b is present (recessive), the bird is brown.\n\nPhenotype for pattern:\n\n- If C is present (dominant), the bird is checkered.\n- If c is present (recessive), the bird is plain.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Brown (CcBb?) No, wait: Actually, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (dominant for both traits)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (only B dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (only b recessive)\n4. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5.

CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because some combinations might be missing. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of each genotype correctly.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the number of each genotype is calculated using the formula (p^2 + 2pq + q^2) for each gene. Assuming the parents are homozygous for both traits, all offspring will have the same genotype for each gene.\n\nSo for gene C:\n\nProbability of CC = 25%, Cc = 50%, cc = 25%\n\nSame for gene B: BB = 25%, Bb = 50%, bb = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply:\n\nFor example, the probability of CC and BB is 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, CC and Bb is 25% * 50% = 12.5%.\n\nAnd so on for all 16 possible combinations.\n\nBut since the question is about phenotypic ratios, not genotypic, I need to categorize each genotype into its phenotype.\n\nLet's see:\n\nCheckered Red: Both C and B dominant \u2192 CC BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nCheckered Brown: Either B is recessive or C is recessive.\n\nWait, no. Checkered brown is when either C is recessive (so no checkered pattern) OR B is recessive (brown).\n\nSo phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red: CC BB \u2192 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown: (CC Bb) + (cc BB) + (CC bb) + (cc Bb) + (cc bb) \u2192 Let's calculate this.\n\nWait, no: Checkered brown occurs when either C is absent (so no checkered pattern, hence brown) or B is absent (so brown regardless of C). So the genotypes contributing to checkered brown are:\n\n- CC bb \u2192 brown (no C)\n- cc BB \u2192 brown (no B)\n- cc Bb \u2192 brown (no B)\n- cc bb \u2192 brown (no B and no C)\n\nSo adding up their probabilities:\n\n(25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% for cc bb\n(25% cc) * (50% Bb) = 12.5% for cc Bb\n(50% BB) * (25% cc) = 12.5% for BB cc\n(50% BB) * (50% Bb) = 25% for BB Bb\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up the calculations.\n\nActually, the correct way is:\n\nFor each possible genotype, sum the probabilities where the phenotype is checkered brown.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these together: 6.25 + 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 = ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question involves a dihybrid cross between two birds: one that's homozygously checkered red (CCBB) and another that's plain brown (ccbb). We need to create a Punnett square for their offspring and determine the phenotypic ratios based on the given options.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the genes involved. There are two genes here: one for the color pattern (B and b) and one for the dominance in the pattern (C and c). \n\nThe parent birds are:\n- Homozygous Checkered Red: CC BB\n- Plain Brown: cc bb\n\nSo when they mate, each bird will produce gametes. Since CCBB is homozygous, all its gametes should be CB. Similarly, ccbb is homozygous, so all its gametes should be cb. This makes sense because both parents are homozygous for their respective alleles.\n\nNow, if we have two CcBB parent birds crossing, the possible gametes from each would be CB, Cb, cB, and cb. But wait, since both parents are CCBB and ccbb, the gametes from each parent are all CB and cb respectively. So when they combine, the F1 generation would get one gamete from each parent. Therefore, the F1 should be CcBB (from CB), CcBb (from CB and cb?), no\u2014wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If both parents are heterozygous for both traits, then the F1 would be Cc for the first gene (since it's the dominant one) and Bb for the second gene? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the F1 generation comes from combining the gametes of CCBB and ccbb. Since CCBB can only make CB gametes and ccbb can only make cb gametes, the F1 would consist of four combinations: CB and cb. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each bird produces four types of gametes, but both parents contribute two different gametes each, leading to four F1 offspring.\n\nBut in reality, each bird contributes two gametes, so when you pair them, you get four possible combinations. So the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CB x cb: CB + cb = CcBb?\nWait, no. Let me clarify: Each bird has two alleles, so the F1 would be the combination of one allele from each parent. Since CCBB gives CB, and ccbb gives cb, the F1 would be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb?\n\nNo, wait, let me do it properly. Each bird contributes one allele to the offspring. So from CCBB, it can give either C or B. From ccbb, it can give either c or b. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- C (from CCBB) + c (from ccbb) = Cc\n- C (from CCBB) + b (from ccbb) = Cb\n- B (from CCBB) + c (from ccbb) = Bc\n- B (from CCBB) + b (from ccbb) = Bb\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because each bird has two pairs of alleles. Let me correct that.\n\nEach parent is CCBB and ccbb. When crossed, each bird will produce two types of gametes: from CCBB, it can produce CB gametes, and from ccbb, it can produce cb gametes. So the F1 generation would be the combination of these gametes. Since each bird contributes one gamete, the F1 would be:\n\n- CB from one parent and cb from the other: CB + cb = CcBb\n- CB from one and CB from the other: same as above.\nWait, no\u2014that's not how it works. Each bird contributes one gamete, so the F1 would have the following possible combinations:\n\nFrom the first bird (CCBB): CB or CB (but since it's homozygous, both are CB)\nFrom the second bird (ccbb): cb or cb (both are cb)\n\nSo the F1 will be:\n\n- CB (from CCBB) and cb (from ccbb) \u2192 CcBb\n- CB (from CCBB) and cb (from ccbb) \u2192 CcBb\nSimilarly, the other bird could also produce CB and cb, but since each bird only produces one gamete, each F1 individual gets one gamete from each parent.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually more accurate to say that each F1 individual receives one allele from each parent. So each parent contributes one allele per gene. So for the first gene (C/c), since one parent is CC and the other is cc, each F1 will receive C from the first parent and c from the second. For the second gene (B/b), since one parent is BB and the other is bb, each F1 will receive B from the first parent and b from the second. Therefore, all F1 individuals are CcBb.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Because if the parents are CCBB (homozygous) and ccbb (homozygous), then any F1 offspring must inherit CC from one parent and cc from the other. Wait, no\u2014the parents are each homozygous for both traits. So each parent is CC BB, meaning both alleles for C are C, and both for B are B. Similarly, the other parent is cc bb, so both alleles for c are c, and both for b are b.\n\nWhen they mate, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C, each parent contributes C (from CCBB) or C (since both are C). Similarly, for gene B, each parent contributes B (from BB) or B (from bb). Wait, no\u2014the parents are CCBB and ccbb, so each parent has two Cs and two Bs for the first gene, and two cs and two bs for the second gene.\n\nTherefore, each F1 offspring will have one allele for each gene from each parent. So for gene C, each parent contributes either C or C (since both are C), and for gene B, each parent contributes either B or B (since both are B). Thus, all F1 offspring will be CcBb.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Let me correct that. Each parent is CC BB, which means for gene C, both alleles are C, and for gene B, both are B. Similarly, the other parent is cc bb, so for gene c, both are c, and for gene b, both are b.\n\nThus, each F1 offspring will receive one allele for each gene from each parent. So for gene C, each parent contributes either C (from CCBB) or C (since both are C). Similarly, for gene B, each parent contributes either B (from BB) or B (since both are B). Therefore, all F1 offspring will be CcBb.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the idea of F1 being CcBb. However, considering that each parent can only contribute C and B, and c and b, respectively, the F1 would indeed be CcBb.\n\nBut let me confirm this because sometimes when both parents are homozygous, the F1 can be different. Wait, no\u2014in this case, each parent is homozygous for both traits, so all F1 will inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Therefore, all F1 offspring will be CcBb.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions an F2 generation, so perhaps the initial step was wrong. Maybe the parents aren't both homozygous for both traits. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nAh, wait\u2014the parents are CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). Both are homozygous for both traits. So each parent is homozygous for both genes, meaning that all their gametes carry both alleles for each gene. Therefore, the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, when they self-pollinate (which isn't mentioned yet), the F1 becomes F2. But according to the question, we're supposed to look at the F2 generation.\n\nWait, but the question says \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So the parents are CCBB and ccbb, but we need to consider their F2 generation.\n\nWait, but usually, when you cross two homozygous parents, all the F1 are the same genotype, and then the F2 would come from those F1 parents. But since the F1 are all CcBb, their offspring would be CcBb x CcBb, resulting in CcBb x CcBb, leading to F2 with various genotypes and phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are CC BB and cc bb, and when crossed, the F1 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, leading to F2.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question specifies a dihybrid cross where one parent is homozygous checkered red (CCBB) and the other is plain brown (ccbb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and then the F2 would be generated from F1 parents. So yes, the F2 would come from F1 parents.\n\nSo, now, the F2 generation would consist of F1 x F1, which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The Punnett square for this cross would result in the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc for gene C, and Bb \u00d7 Bb for gene B.\n\nFor each gene, the possible gametes are C and c for gene C, and B and b for gene B.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypic ratios would be:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratios would be the product of these probabilities.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about phenotypic ratios, not the genotypic ones. So we need to map the genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nGiven the traits:\n\n- Dominant alleles for color (B and b) lead to red or brown pigmentation.\n- Dominant alleles for pattern (C and c) lead to checkered or plain patterns.\n\nAssuming that both genes are acting independently:\n\nPhenotype for color:\n\n- If B is present (either dominant), the bird is red.\n- If b is present (recessive), the bird is brown.\n\nPhenotype for pattern:\n\n- If C is present (dominant), the bird is checkered.\n- If c is present (recessive), the bird is plain.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Brown (CcBb?) No, wait: Actually, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (dominant for both traits)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (only B dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (only b recessive)\n4. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5.

CC bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because some combinations might be missing. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of each genotype correctly.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the number of each genotype is calculated using the formula (p^2 + 2pq + q^2) for each gene. Assuming the parents are homozygous for both traits, all offspring will have the same genotype for each gene.\n\nSo for gene C:\n\nProbability of CC = 25%, Cc = 50%, cc = 25%\n\nSame for gene B: BB = 25%, Bb = 50%, bb = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply:\n\nFor example, the probability of CC and BB is 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, CC and Bb is 25% * 50% = 12.5%.\n\nAnd so on for all 16 possible combinations.\n\nBut since the question is about phenotypic ratios, not genotypic, I need to categorize each genotype into its phenotype.\n\nLet's see:\n\nCheckered Red: Both C and B dominant \u2192 CC BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nCheckered Brown: Either B is recessive or C is recessive.\n\nWait, no. Checkered brown is when either C is recessive (so no checkered pattern) OR B is recessive (brown).\n\nSo phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red: CC BB \u2192 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown: (CC Bb) + (cc BB) + (CC bb) + (cc Bb) + (cc bb) \u2192 Let's calculate this.\n\nWait, no: Checkered brown occurs when either C is absent (so no checkered pattern, hence brown) or B is absent (so brown regardless of C). So the genotypes contributing to checkered brown are:\n\n- CC bb \u2192 brown (no C)\n- cc BB \u2192 brown (no B)\n- cc Bb \u2192 brown (no B)\n- cc bb \u2192 brown (no B and no C)\n\nSo adding up their probabilities:\n\n(25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% for cc bb\n(25% cc) * (50% Bb) = 12.5% for cc Bb\n(50% BB) * (25% cc) = 12.5% for BB cc\n(50% BB) * (50% Bb) = 25% for BB Bb\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm mixing up the calculations.\n\nActually, the correct way is:\n\nFor each possible genotype, sum the probabilities where the phenotype is checkered brown.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these together: 6.25 + 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 = ",

One bird is homozygously checkered red (CCBB), and the other is plain brown (ccbb). We need to complete a Punnett square for this cross, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. Then, there are several options provided, each giving different phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let me break down the given information:\n\n- Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - Dominant (C): Checkered red\n  - Recessive (c): Plain red\n- Gene B determines color:\n  - Dominant (B): Checkered brown\n  - Recessive (b): Plain brown\n- The parent cross is between CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (homozygous plain brown).\n\nSo, the parents are both homozygous for their respective traits because they're stated as such (CCBB and ccbb). That means all offspring will be heterozygotes when crossed once (F1), but since we're looking at F2, which comes from F1 parents, that suggests we'll have a dihybrid cross in terms of genes C/B and c/b.\n\nWait, actually, no. The initial cross is between CCBB (which would give gametes CB) and ccbb (gametes cb). So, F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. But then, the F2 generation comes from F1 individuals, meaning we have another round of independent assortment.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"for this cross,\" which might refer to the initial cross producing F1, and then considering the F2 generated from F1 parents. Alternatively, perhaps the entire setup is about F2, starting from a dihybrid cross.\n\nLet me clarify: the first part describes the setup, including possible gametes and F1 and F2 generations. However, the actual question seems to focus on the F2 generation after crossing a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) with a plain brown bird (ccbb). Wait, no\u2014looking back, the problem states: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me see:\n\nThe correct setup is between CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (homozygous plain brown). So, these are both homozygous, leading to an F1 generation where all offspring are CcBb, as each parent gives either C or B for gene C, and either c or b for gene B.\n\nThen, the next step is creating the F2 generation, which would come from F1 parents (CcBb x CcBb). This is a dihybrid cross, so the expected phenotypes can be calculated using the 9-3-3-1 rule.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on both gene C and gene B. So, we need to consider all combinations:\n\nFor gene C:\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Checkered red (since C is dominant over c)\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n\nFor gene B:\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach combination of these two genes will determine the phenotype. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Plain red (c_B_)\n3. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n4. Plain brown (cbb)\n\nNext, I'll calculate the expected phenotypic ratio using the Punnett square.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (like F1 x F1), the 9 possible combinations are:\n\n- 9/16 C_B_: Checkered red\n- 3/16 c_B_: Plain red\n- 3/16 C_bb: Checkered brown\n- 1/16 cbb: Plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Matches our calculation.\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Inverses of our result.\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Also inverses.\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All equal, doesn't fit.\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\nOption K: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Same as D, but reversed.\nOption L: Not here, assuming none.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, which shows the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1 for checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown respectively.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question involves an adihybrid cross between two birds. One bird is homozygously checkered red (CCBB), and the other is plain brown (ccbb). We need to complete a Punnett square for this cross, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. Then, there are several options provided, each giving different phenotypic ratios.\n\nFirst, let me break down the given information:\n\n- Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - Dominant (C): Checkered red\n  - Recessive (c): Plain red\n- Gene B determines color:\n  - Dominant (B): Checkered brown\n  - Recessive (b): Plain brown\n- The parent cross is between CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (homozygous plain brown).\n\nSo, the parents are both homozygous for their respective traits because they're stated as such (CCBB and ccbb). That means all offspring will be heterozygotes when crossed once (F1), but since we're looking at F2, which comes from F1 parents, that suggests we'll have a dihybrid cross in terms of genes C/B and c/b.\n\nWait, actually, no. The initial cross is between CCBB (which would give gametes CB) and ccbb (gametes cb). So, F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. But then, the F2 generation comes from F1 individuals, meaning we have another round of independent assortment.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"for this cross,\" which might refer to the initial cross producing F1, and then considering the F2 generated from F1 parents. Alternatively, perhaps the entire setup is about F2, starting from a dihybrid cross.\n\nLet me clarify: the first part describes the setup, including possible gametes and F1 and F2 generations. However, the actual question seems to focus on the F2 generation after crossing a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) with a plain brown bird (ccbb). Wait, no\u2014looking back, the problem states: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me see:\n\nThe correct setup is between CCBB (homozygous checkered red) and ccbb (homozygous plain brown). So, these are both homozygous, leading to an F1 generation where all offspring are CcBb, as each parent gives either C or B for gene C, and either c or b for gene B.\n\nThen, the next step is creating the F2 generation, which would come from F1 parents (CcBb x CcBb). This is a dihybrid cross, so the expected phenotypes can be calculated using the 9-3-3-1 rule.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on both gene C and gene B. So, we need to consider all combinations:\n\nFor gene C:\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Checkered red (since C is dominant over c)\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n\nFor gene B:\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach combination of these two genes will determine the phenotype. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Plain red (c_B_)\n3. Checkered brown (C_bb)\n4. Plain brown (cbb)\n\nNext, I'll calculate the expected phenotypic ratio using the Punnett square.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross (like F1 x F1), the 9 possible combinations are:\n\n- 9/16 C_B_: Checkered red\n- 3/16 c_B_: Plain red\n- 3/16 C_bb: Checkered brown\n- 1/16 cbb: Plain brown\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Matches our calculation.\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Inverses of our result.\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Also inverses.\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All equal, doesn't fit.\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No.\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No.\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\nOption K: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Same as D, but reversed.\nOption L: Not here, assuming none.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, which shows the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1 for checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown respectively.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

We need to create a Punnett square for their offspring, specifically the F2 generation. \n\nFirst, let me break down the genes involved. There are two pairs: one determining color (C/B) and another for the pattern (c/b). Since these are independent traits, we can analyze them separately but also consider their interaction in the cross.\n\nStarting with the parents:\n- Parent 1: CC (homozygous checkered) and BB (homozygous red). So both alleles for color are dominant, making it checkered red.\n- Parent 2: cc (homozygous plain) and bb (homozygous brown). Both alleles here are recessive, so it becomes plain brown.\n\nNow, when they mate, each parent will produce gametes based on Mendel's laws. However, since these are separate genes, the F1 generation would inherit one allele from each parent.\n\nFor the F1 generation:\n- Each parent contributes either C or c for the color gene, and B or b for the pigment gene.\n- So the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb.\n- Therefore, the F1 genotype would be CcBB (from Parent 1), CcBb (Parent 1 and Parent 2), etc. Wait, actually, each F1 bird would receive one allele from each parent. So for the F1, the possible combinations are Cc (from Parent 1) and c (from Parent 2) for the first gene, and B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2) for the second gene.\n\nWait no, actually, each parent contributes one allele. So Parent 1 is CC BB, which gives either C or C and B or B. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, giving c and b. But wait, Parent 1 isn't heterozygous for color; it's homozygous for both because CC and BB. Similarly, Parent 2 is homozygous for both. So all F1 offspring would get CC from Parent 1 and cc from Parent 2, meaning all F1 would be Cc cc? No, wait, that's not right. Because Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only give C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only give c and b. So F1 would receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the first gene, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 for the second gene. So each F1 bird would be CcBb.\n\nBut then the F1s would all be CcBb. Now, when these F1s self-pollinate to form F2, we'll look at the segregation of each gene independently.\n\nEach F1 bird has the genotype CcBb. When they self-fertilize, each gene segregates independently. So for the color gene (C/c), there are three possibilities: CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Similarly, for the pigment gene (B/b), there are three possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%).\n\nSince the two genes are linked but also functionally independent, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be the product of the probabilities for each trait. So:\n\n- Probability of checkered red: (Probability of CC) * (Probability of BB) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Probability of checkered brown: (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n- Probability of plain red: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n- Probability of plain brown: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n\nSo translating into counts assuming a large number of offspring, say 16 birds (since 4x4=16):\n\n- Checkered red: 6\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 6\n- Plain brown: 2\n\nThat matches option A.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option A states the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if considering the F2 generation, the actual count depends on how many offspring there are, but the ratios remain the same regardless of the total number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So Parent 1 is CC BB, which gives either C or C and B or B. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, giving c and b. But wait, Parent 1 isn't heterozygous for color; it's homozygous for both because CC and BB. Similarly, Parent 2 is homozygous for both. So all F1 offspring would get CC from Parent 1 and cc from Parent 2, meaning all F1 would be Cc cc? No, wait, that's not right. Because Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only give C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only give c and b. So F1 would receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2 for the first gene, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 for the second gene.
