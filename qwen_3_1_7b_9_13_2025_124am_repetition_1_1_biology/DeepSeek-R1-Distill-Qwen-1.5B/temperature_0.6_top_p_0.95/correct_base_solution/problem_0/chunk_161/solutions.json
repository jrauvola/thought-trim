    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

But looking back, the options may not account for scaling factors. Wait, perhaps I've misapplied the probabilities. Let me double-check. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So, for a bird to have red (C) and brown (B), both genes must be present. The probability for C is 3/4, and for B is 3/4, but since they're independent, the combined probability is 9/16. Similarly, for only red (B absent), the probability is (3/4)(1/4)=3/16. Only brown (C absent) is also 3/16. Neither is 1/16. Therefore, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. However, the options seem to list the counts per phenotype without the ratio. So option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That aligns with our calculation of 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

But looking back, the options may not account for scaling factors. Wait, perhaps I've misapplied the probabilities. Let me double-check. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So, for a bird to have red (C) and brown (B), both genes must be present. The probability for C is 3/4, and for B is 3/4, but since they're independent, the combined probability is 9/16. Similarly, for only red (B absent), the probability is (3/4)(1/4)=3/16. Only brown (C absent) is also 3/16. Neither is 1/16. Therefore, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. However, the options seem to list the counts per phenotype without the ratio. So option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That aligns with our calculation of 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

    "rollout": " E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, according to my calculations, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but looking at option E, it's 3:9:1:3, which is different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me re-examine. Another approach is to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C present and B present (9/16)\nPhenotype B: C present and B absent (3/16)\nPhenotype C: C absent and B present (3/16)\nPhenotype D: Neither present (1/16)\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options exactly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nThat's 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nSum: 16\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nSum:16\nOption A: 6:6:2:2 \u2192 sum 16\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 sum 16\nOption D: 2:6:2:6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nLooking back, our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But none of the options list 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option E, which has a ratio that sums to 16 but is structured differently. Wait, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in terms of their squares. Let me try another approach. Using a Punnett square for F2, considering both genes:\n\nEach gene has a 25% chance of producing each allele. The F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25% of the time\nPhenotype 2: C, not B \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nPhenotype 3: Not C, B \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nPhenotype 4: Neither \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nIf we round these percentages to whole numbers, we get 6.25 \u2248 6, 12.5 \u2248 13, etc. But this approach might not align perfectly. Alternatively, considering the actual counts, the F2 generation should have the following:\n\nTotal offspring: 16 (assuming 100% efficiency)\nPhenotype Counts:\n- Both traits (checkered and red): 9\n- Checkered only (B present, C absent): 3\n- Red only (C present, B absent): 3\n- Neither (plain and checkered): 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nYes! Option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C. However, upon reviewing, the original options didn't include 9:3:3:1. Wait, checking the user's options:\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6:6:2:2\nB.8:4:0:4\nC.9:3:3:1\nD.2:6:2:6\nE.3:9:1:3\n\nAh, I see now.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, according to my calculations, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but looking at option E, it's 3:9:1:3, which is different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me re-examine. Another approach is to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype A: C present and B present (9/16)\nPhenotype B: C present and B absent (3/16)\nPhenotype C: C absent and B present (3/16)\nPhenotype D: Neither present (1/16)\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options exactly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nThat's 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nSum: 16\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nSum:16\nOption A: 6:6:2:2 \u2192 sum 16\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 sum 16\nOption D: 2:6:2:6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nLooking back, our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But none of the options list 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option E, which has a ratio that sums to 16 but is structured differently. Wait, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in terms of their squares. Let me try another approach. Using a Punnett square for F2, considering both genes:\n\nEach gene has a 25% chance of producing each allele. The F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25% of the time\nPhenotype 2: C, not B \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nPhenotype 3: Not C, B \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nPhenotype 4: Neither \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nIf we round these percentages to whole numbers, we get 6.25 \u2248 6, 12.5 \u2248 13, etc. But this approach might not align perfectly. Alternatively, considering the actual counts, the F2 generation should have the following:\n\nTotal offspring: 16 (assuming 100% efficiency)\nPhenotype Counts:\n- Both traits (checkered and red): 9\n- Checkered only (B present, C absent): 3\n- Red only (C present, B absent): 3\n- Neither (plain and checkered): 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nYes! Option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C. However, upon reviewing, the original options didn't include 9:3:3:1. Wait, checking the user's options:\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6:6:2:2\nB.8:4:0:4\nC.9:3:3:1\nD.2:6:2:6\nE.3:9:1:3\n\nAh, I see now. Option C indeed states 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, meaning Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1. Yes, that matches. Option C states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which aligns perfectly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination.

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A to J, each giving different counts. Let me look again.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This sums up to 16, which aligns with our calculations. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:9, but looking at the options:\n\nLooking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A: 6,2,2,2; B:8,4,0,4; C:9,3,3,1; D:1,3,9,3; E:3,9,1,3. Hmm, according to our calculations, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. Wait, but looking back, I think I may have mixed up the order. Option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That would correspond to Phenotype C: 3, Phenotype B: 3, Phenotype D: 1, and Phenotype A: 9. Wait, but the options list them as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps the order is different. Let me clarify: - Phenotype A: checkered red (from c and bb)\n- Phenotype B: checkered brown (from c and Bb)\n- Phenotype C: plain red (from cc and bb)\n- Phenotype D: plain brown (from cc and Bb)\n\nSo in terms of the options, option C lists checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). Yes, that matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the correct answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Because in the problem statement, the options list the phenotypes in order: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our calculations, checkered red would be phenotype D (neither) with 1 part, checkered brown with B (only C) with 3 parts, plain red with C (only B) with 3 parts, and plain brown with A (both) with 9 parts. So the ratio would be 1:3:3:9. That corresponds to option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, that's the inverse. Wait, according to our count, the frequencies are 1 (D), 3 (B), 3 (C), 9 (A). So the ratio is A:B:C:D = 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C lists plain red as 9, checkered red as 5, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the other way around. Let me double-check. The phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Our calculations showed that:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D: 1 part\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Plain red: red and plain \u2192 Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A: 9 parts\n\nSo the ratio would be A (9), B (3), C (3), D (1).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3. Oh, wait, I think I messed up the interpretation. Because in the problem statement, the options list the phenotypes in order: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our calculations, checkered red would be phenotype D (neither) with 1 part, checkered brown with B (only C) with 3 parts, plain red with C (only B) with 3 parts, and plain brown with A (both) with 9 parts. So the ratio would be 1:3:3:9. That corresponds to option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, that's the inverse. Wait, according to our count, the frequencies are 1 (D), 3 (B), 3 (C), 9 (A). So the ratio is A:B:C:D = 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C lists plain red as 9, checkered red as 5, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the other way around. Let me double-check. The phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Our calculations showed that:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D: 1 part\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Plain red: red and plain \u2192 Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A: 9 parts\n\nSo the ratio would be A (9), B (3), C (3), D (1). Which matches option C. Option C states: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that's correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A through H, each giving a different ratio.",
    "rollout": " A through H, each giving a different ratio. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding these up: 3+9+1+3=16. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1. Wait, no, that's not exactly matching. Alternatively, the ratio of checkered red to plain red is 3:1, and similarly checkered brown to plain brown is 9:3. So the overall F2 ratio is 1:3:1:3 when considering the combined counts. Wait, but looking back, the user didn't provide the options; they just presented the choices. Wait, the user included options A through H, each with different ratios. Let me look again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6+2=8, 6+2=8 \u2192 Ratio 4:4:4:4? Wait, no. Wait, checking the options:\n\nLooking back, the user presented the options as:\n\nA. ... \nB. ...\nC. ...\n...\nH. ...\n\nEach option lists the expected phenotypic ratio. From what I recall, the correct ratio is 1:3:1:3 for the F2 generation, meaning checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1:3:1:3. But looking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't seem right. Option F says 4:4:4:4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. That can't be right because the phenotypes aren't equally likely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options. Let me re-examine the options provided by the user:\n\nThe user listed options starting from A to H, each defining a phenotypic ratio. Let me list them again as provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16, which is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1.\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 2:1:0:1\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12:2:2:0\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\n\nNow, according to my earlier analysis, the correct F2 ratio should reflect the probabilities I calculated earlier. Specifically, the phenotypic distribution should follow a 1:3:1:3 ratio, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options directly state that. Option E states 3:9:1:3, which is equivalent to 1:3:1/3:1 if divided by 3. But perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio without scaling, so the numbers add up to 16, as seen in option E. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype B: Only C \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: Only B \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but if we consider the entire population, it's 9+3+3+1=16 parts. However, looking at the options, option E presents the ratio as 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what I have. Wait, perhaps the order of the options is different. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So that's 3:9:1:3, which adds up to 16. But according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. None of the options match that. Option E is the closest, but the order is reversed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, or I misunderstood the problem. Let me try another approach. Instead of calculating probabilities, perhaps I can think about the F2 generation based on the possible gametes and their combinations.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nF1: CC BB (only has one allele for each gene, so technically it's still heterozygous for each gene?)\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous, their F1 will all be homozygous. So F1 is CC BB and cc bb. When they mate, F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFrom F1:\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n\nWhich averages to:\n- 50% CB\n- 50% cb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, for phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red pigment \u2192 checkered (c is recessive for B, but wait\u2014CC is dominant for C, so it's red. But does C affect the B gene? Yes, because C is the dominant allele for pigment, while b is recessive. So, in terms of pigmentation, CC would be red, but B is also present (as C is dominant over b). So the phenotype is red and checkered? Wait, no\u2014that's mixing up. Wait, no\u2014pigment color is determined by C, and body color by B. So a bird with CC is red (because C is dominant) but since B is present (as C is dominant, so the B allele is present?), no\u2014wait, no\u2014the B gene is about color, but the presence of dominant alleles in C affects the pigment color. So, a bird with CC (dominant C) is red, and regardless of the B gene (which may or may not be present), it's considered red. Similarly, a bird with cc is plain, regardless of B. So the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- CC (C present, B present) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc (C present, B absent) \u2192 red and checkered\n- cc (B present, b recessive) \u2192 plain and brown\n- cc (B absent, b recessive) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because, for each gene, the presence of a dominant allele determines that trait. So, for pigment color (C):\n\n- CC or Cc \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- BB or Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype combines both traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) AND brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C present) AND checkered (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2: red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain (C absent) AND brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain (C absent) AND checkered (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes lead to these phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, the number of birds with each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBut wait, no\u2014all four genotypes (CC, Cc, cc, bb) have a certain distribution among the phenotypes based on the dominance of each gene.\n\nLet me calculate the expected phenotypic ratios based on the four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (red pigment): 25% of the population\n   - Among these, B is present (since CC is always B present?) Wait, no\u2014CC has the B allele, so B is present. Therefore, Phenotype 1: red and brown.\n\n2. Cc (red pigment): 50% of the population\n   - Among these, half have B (Bb) and half have bb (since it's Cc).\n   - So, Phenotype 2: red and checkered.\n\n3. cc (plain pigment): 25% of the population\n   - Among these, B is recessive (bb), so Phenotype 4: plain and checkered.\n\n4. bb (plain pigment): 25% of the population\n   - Among these, B is recessive (bb), so Phenotype 4: plain and checkered.\n\nWait, that can't be right because cc (plain pigment) would have B absent, but bb would also have B absent. So Phenotype 4 is common in both cc and bb.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- Phenotype 1: red and brown \u2192 25% of the population\n- Phenotype 2: red and checkered \u2192 50% of the population\n- Phenotype 4: plain and checkered \u2192 50% of the population\n- Phenotype 3: plain and brown \u2192 0% of the population\n\nWait, that can't be correct because each bird must have two traits, but according to the rules above, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. However, in reality, a bird cannot have both traits unless both are present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping.\n\nWait, no\u2014a bird can have both traits if it has dominant alleles in both genes. For example, a bird with CcBb would have both traits, but a bird with CCbb would have only pigment red (since C is present) and body black (because B is recessive). Similarly, a bird with ccBB would have body brown and pigment black (since B is present), and a bird with ccbb would have both traits missing.\n\nTherefore, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- CC (red pigment) and B (brown color) \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n- CC and bb \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n- Cc (red pigment) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 2: red and checkered\n- Cc and bb \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n- cc (plain pigment) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n- cc and bb \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n\nWait, but this leads to:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC (25%), B (brown) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 3: cc (25%), B (brown) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: Cc (50%), B (brown) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 4: cc (25%), bb \u2192 25%, plus cc (25%) and bb (25%), totaling 50%.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25%\n- Phenotype 3: 25%\n- Phenotype 2: 50%\n- Phenotype 4: 50%\n\nThis gives a ratio of 25:50:50:25, which simplifies to 1:2:2:1. But this contradicts my previous calculation. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: a bird is considered to have the dominant trait for a gene if it carries at least one dominant allele for that gene. So, for pigment color, any C allele results in red pigment, regardless of B. For body color, any B allele results in brown, regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, a bird with C and B \u2192 red and brown. A bird with C and b \u2192 red and checkered. A bird with c and B \u2192 plain and brown. A bird with c and b \u2192 plain and checkered.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red, brown)\n- 50% Cc (red, checkered)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n- 25% bb (plain, checkered)\n\nBut wait, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\n- CC and B \u2192 red and brown\n- CC and bb \u2192 red and brown (since B is present)\n- Cc and B \u2192 red and checkered\n- Cc and bb \u2192 red and checkered\n- cc and B \u2192 plain and brown\n- cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nWait, but this leads to:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC and B \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: CC and bb \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: Cc and B \u2192 50%\nPhenotype 4: cc and bb \u2192 50%\n\nAdding up, 25% + 25% + 50% + 50% = 150%, which exceeds 100%, so something's wrong. I think I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes combine. Perhaps instead, each bird has two traits, each determined by their own gene. So the phenotype is a combination of the two traits. For example, a bird can be:\n\n- Red and Brown\n- Red and Checkered\n- Plain and Brown\n- Plain and Checkered\n\nThe count of each depends on the frequency of each genotype leading to that phenotype.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- CC (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red and Brown\n- CC (red) and bb \u2192 Red and Brown\n- Cc (red) and B \u2192 Red and Checkered\n- Cc (red) and bb \u2192 Red and Checkered\n- cc (plain) and B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- cc (plain) and bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown: 25% (CC and B) + 25% (CC and bb) = 50%\n- Red and Checkered: 50% (Cc and B) + 50% (Cc and bb) = 100%?\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because that would mean 50% + 50% = 100%, but that doesn\u2019t align with the possible combinations. Wait, no\u2014the correct breakdown is:\n\nRed and Brown: 25% (CC, B) + 25% (CC, bb) = 50%\nRed and Checkered: 50% (Cc, B) + 50% (Cc, bb) = 100%? That can't be right because the total exceeds 100%. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's not possible for a bird to be both Red and Brown and Red and Checkered simultaneously. Each bird has two distinct traits, so the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Red and Brown: Occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele in both genes. So:\n\n   - CC (red) and B (brown): Phenotype 1\n   - CC and bb: Phenotype 1\n   - Cc (red) and B: Phenotype 2\n   - Cc and bb: Phenotype 2\n- Plain and Brown: Occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele in the B gene but not in the C gene. So:\n\n   - cc (plain) and B (brown): Phenotype 3\n   - cc and bb: Phenotype 3\n- Plain and Checkered: Occurs when the bird has no dominant alleles in either gene. So:\n\n   - cc (plain) and bb (checkered): Phenotype 4\n   - cc (plain) and bb (checkered): Phenotype 4\n\nWait, but this leads to:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC and B (25%) + CC and bb (25%) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 2: Cc and B (50%) + Cc and bb (50%) \u2192 100%\n- Phenotype 3: cc and B (25%) + cc and bb (25%) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 4: cc and bb \u2192 25%\n\nThis sums up to 50% + 100% + 50% + 25% = 225%, which is incorrect. I must be miscalculating.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each bird has two independent traits, so the phenotypic ratios are determined by the multiplication of the probabilities for each trait. For example, the probability of having both traits present is (prob of C) * (prob of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. The probability of having only C is (prob of C) * (prob of bb) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly for only B.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Both traits: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 9:3:3:1, but scaled to integers. Multiplying each by 16 gives 9:3:3:1, but when considering the total number of birds, it's 16 parts. This would mean that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 parts of one phenotype, 3 parts of another, etc. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them match this exact ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the actual counts based on the F2 generation:\n\nTotal F2 birds: Let's assume 1",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through H, each giving a different ratio. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding these up: 3+9+1+3=16. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1. Wait, no, that's not exactly matching. Alternatively, the ratio of checkered red to plain red is 3:1, and similarly checkered brown to plain brown is 9:3. So the overall F2 ratio is 1:3:1:3 when considering the combined counts. Wait, but looking back, the user didn't provide the options; they just presented the choices. Wait, the user included options A through H, each with different ratios. Let me look again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6+2=8, 6+2=8 \u2192 Ratio 4:4:4:4? Wait, no. Wait, checking the options:\n\nLooking back, the user presented the options as:\n\nA. ... \nB. ...\nC. ...\n...\nH. ...\n\nEach option lists the expected phenotypic ratio. From what I recall, the correct ratio is 1:3:1:3 for the F2 generation, meaning checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1:3:1:3. But looking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't seem right. Option F says 4:4:4:4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. That can't be right because the phenotypes aren't equally likely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options. Let me re-examine the options provided by the user:\n\nThe user listed options starting from A to H, each defining a phenotypic ratio. Let me list them again as provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16, which is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1.\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 2:1:0:1\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 1:1:1:1\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12:2:2:0\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\n\nNow, according to my earlier analysis, the correct F2 ratio should reflect the probabilities I calculated earlier. Specifically, the phenotypic distribution should follow a 1:3:1:3 ratio, but scaled appropriately. However, none of the options directly state that. Option E states 3:9:1:3, which is equivalent to 1:3:1/3:1 if divided by 3. But perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio without scaling, so the numbers add up to 16, as seen in option E. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype B: Only C \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: Only B \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but if we consider the entire population, it's 9+3+3+1=16 parts. However, looking at the options, option E presents the ratio as 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what I have. Wait, perhaps the order of the options is different. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So that's 3:9:1:3, which adds up to 16. But according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. None of the options match that. Option E is the closest, but the order is reversed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options, or I misunderstood the problem. Let me try another approach. Instead of calculating probabilities, perhaps I can think about the F2 generation based on the possible gametes and their combinations.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nF1: CC BB (only has one allele for each gene, so technically it's still heterozygous for each gene?)\n\nWait, no\u2014if both parents are homozygous, their F1 will all be homozygous. So F1 is CC BB and cc bb. When they mate, F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nFrom F1:\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n- 25% CB\n- 25% cb\n\nWhich averages to:\n- 50% CB\n- 50% cb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, for phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red pigment \u2192 checkered (c is recessive for B, but wait\u2014CC is dominant for C, so it's red. But does C affect the B gene? Yes, because C is the dominant allele for pigment, while b is recessive. So, in terms of pigmentation, CC would be red, but B is also present (as C is dominant over b). So the phenotype is red and checkered? Wait, no\u2014that's mixing up. Wait, no\u2014pigment color is determined by C, and body color by B. So a bird with CC is red (because C is dominant) but since B is present (as C is dominant, so the B allele is present?), no\u2014wait, no\u2014the B gene is about color, but the presence of dominant alleles in C affects the pigment color. So, a bird with CC (dominant C) is red, and regardless of the B gene (which may or may not be present), it's considered red. Similarly, a bird with cc is plain, regardless of B. So the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- CC (C present, B present) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc (C present, B absent) \u2192 red and checkered\n- cc (B present, b recessive) \u2192 plain and brown\n- cc (B absent, b recessive) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because, for each gene, the presence of a dominant allele determines that trait. So, for pigment color (C):\n\n- CC or Cc \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- BB or Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype combines both traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C present) AND brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n2. Pigment red (C present) AND checkered (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2: red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain (C absent) AND brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain (C absent) AND checkered (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes lead to these phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, the number of birds with each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBut wait, no\u2014all four genotypes (CC, Cc, cc, bb) have a certain distribution among the phenotypes based on the dominance of each gene.\n\nLet me calculate the expected phenotypic ratios based on the four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (red pigment): 25% of the population\n   - Among these, B is present (since CC is always B present?) Wait, no\u2014CC has the B allele, so B is present. Therefore, Phenotype 1: red and brown.\n\n2. Cc (red pigment): 50% of the population\n   - Among these, half have B (Bb) and half have bb (since it's Cc).\n   - So, Phenotype 2: red and checkered.\n\n3. cc (plain pigment): 25% of the population\n   - Among these, B is recessive (bb), so Phenotype 4: plain and checkered.\n\n4. bb (plain pigment): 25% of the population\n   - Among these, B is recessive (bb), so Phenotype 4: plain and checkered.\n\nWait, that can't be right because cc (plain pigment) would have B absent, but bb would also have B absent. So Phenotype 4 is common in both cc and bb.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- Phenotype 1: red and brown \u2192 25% of the population\n- Phenotype 2: red and checkered \u2192 50% of the population\n- Phenotype 4: plain and checkered \u2192 50% of the population\n- Phenotype 3: plain and brown \u2192 0% of the population\n\nWait, that can't be correct because each bird must have two traits, but according to the rules above, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. However, in reality, a bird cannot have both traits unless both are present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping.\n\nWait, no\u2014a bird can have both traits if it has dominant alleles in both genes. For example, a bird with CcBb would have both traits, but a bird with CCbb would have only pigment red (since C is present) and body black (because B is recessive). Similarly, a bird with ccBB would have body brown and pigment black (since B is present), and a bird with ccbb would have both traits missing.\n\nTherefore, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- CC (red pigment) and B (brown color) \u2192 Phenotype 1: red and brown\n- CC and bb \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n- Cc (red pigment) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 2: red and checkered\n- Cc and bb \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n- cc (plain pigment) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3: plain and brown\n- cc and bb \u2192 Phenotype 4: plain and checkered\n\nWait, but this leads to:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC (25%), B (brown) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 3: cc (25%), B (brown) \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype 2: Cc (50%), B (brown) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 4: cc (25%), bb \u2192 25%, plus cc (25%) and bb (25%), totaling 50%.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25%\n- Phenotype 3: 25%\n- Phenotype 2: 50%\n- Phenotype 4: 50%\n\nThis gives a ratio of 25:50:50:25, which simplifies to 1:2:2:1. But this contradicts my previous calculation. Which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: a bird is considered to have the dominant trait for a gene if it carries at least one dominant allele for that gene. So, for pigment color, any C allele results in red pigment, regardless of B. For body color, any B allele results in brown, regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, a bird with C and B \u2192 red and brown. A bird with C and b \u2192 red and checkered. A bird with c and B \u2192 plain and brown. A bird with c and b \u2192 plain and checkered.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red, brown)\n- 50% Cc (red, checkered)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n- 25% bb (plain, checkered)\n\nBut wait, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\n- CC and B \u2192 red and brown\n- CC and bb \u2192 red and brown (since B is present)\n- Cc and B \u2192 red and checkered\n- Cc and bb \u2192 red and checkered\n- cc and B \u2192 plain and brown\n- cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nWait, but this leads to:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC and B \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: CC and bb \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: Cc and B \u2192 50%\nPhenotype 4: cc and bb \u2192 50%\n\nAdding up, 25% + 25% + 50% + 50% = 150%, which exceeds 100%, so something's wrong. I think I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes combine. Perhaps instead, each bird has two traits, each determined by their own gene. So the phenotype is a combination of the two traits. For example, a bird can be:\n\n- Red and Brown\n- Red and Checkered\n- Plain and Brown\n- Plain and Checkered\n\nThe count of each depends on the frequency of each genotype leading to that phenotype.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- CC (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red and Brown\n- CC (red) and bb \u2192 Red and Brown\n- Cc (red) and B \u2192 Red and Checkered\n- Cc (red) and bb \u2192 Red and Checkered\n- cc (plain) and B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- cc (plain) and bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown: 25% (CC and B) + 25% (CC and bb) = 50%\n- Red and Checkered: 50% (Cc and B) + 50% (Cc and bb) = 100%?\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because that would mean 50% + 50% = 100%, but that doesn\u2019t align with the possible combinations. Wait, no\u2014the correct breakdown is:\n\nRed and Brown: 25% (CC, B) + 25% (CC, bb) = 50%\nRed and Checkered: 50% (Cc, B) + 50% (Cc, bb) = 100%? That can't be right because the total exceeds 100%. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's not possible for a bird to be both Red and Brown and Red and Checkered simultaneously. Each bird has two distinct traits, so the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Red and Brown: Occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele in both genes. So:\n\n   - CC (red) and B (brown): Phenotype 1\n   - CC and bb: Phenotype 1\n   - Cc (red) and B: Phenotype 2\n   - Cc and bb: Phenotype 2\n- Plain and Brown: Occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele in the B gene but not in the C gene. So:\n\n   - cc (plain) and B (brown): Phenotype 3\n   - cc and bb: Phenotype 3\n- Plain and Checkered: Occurs when the bird has no dominant alleles in either gene. So:\n\n   - cc (plain) and bb (checkered): Phenotype 4\n   - cc (plain) and bb (checkered): Phenotype 4\n\nWait, but this leads to:\n\n- Phenotype 1: CC and B (25%) + CC and bb (25%) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 2: Cc and B (50%) + Cc and bb (50%) \u2192 100%\n- Phenotype 3: cc and B (25%) + cc and bb (25%) \u2192 50%\n- Phenotype 4: cc and bb \u2192 25%\n\nThis sums up to 50% + 100% + 50% + 25% = 225%, which is incorrect. I must be miscalculating.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each bird has two independent traits, so the phenotypic ratios are determined by the multiplication of the probabilities for each trait. For example, the probability of having both traits present is (prob of C) * (prob of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. The probability of having only C is (prob of C) * (prob of bb) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly for only B.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Both traits: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 9:3:3:1, but scaled to integers. Multiplying each by 16 gives 9:3:3:1, but when considering the total number of birds, it's 16 parts. This would mean that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 parts of one phenotype, 3 parts of another, etc. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them match this exact ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the actual counts based on the F2 generation:\n\nTotal F2 birds: Let's assume 1",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nC.

But according to our calculations, the ratios should be 9:3:3:1. So option E shows a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. That doesn't seem right because higher frequency would correspond to more birds having both traits. So I think option E is incorrect. Another possibility is that the scaling factor is such that each unit represents a certain number of individuals. For example, if we assume 16 birds, then Phenotype A would be 9, B=3, C=3, D=1. But looking at the options, none have exactly 9:3:3:1. Instead, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit either. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, which isn't correct. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which still doesn't match. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is similar to our 3:9:1:3 but inverted. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypes. According to the problem statement:\n\nRed is controlled by C, and brown by B.\n\nSo, the presence of C means red, presence of B means brown. So, a bird that's red (C) and brown (B) will have both traits, which I called Phenotype A. A bird that's red (C) but not brown (B) is Phenotype B. A bird that's not red (c) but is brown (B) is Phenotype C. A bird that's neither is Phenotype D. So the ratios should indeed be 9:3:3:1, as per the calculations above. None of the options directly reflect this, but option E has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. That suggests that perhaps I misinterpreted the question regarding which trait comes first or if the order is reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are swapped. Wait, in the options, option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. This corresponds to the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which would imply that the checkered color (c) and plain color (c) are represented in the opposite way than I thought. Perhaps in the problem, the order was reversed, with checkered coming before red and brown after. Wait, but the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So red is dominant over checkered, and brown is dominant over plain. So the presence of C leads to red, and the presence of B leads to brown. So the initial interpretation seems correct. Hence, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly show that. Wait, checking the options again:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 (checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown)\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:2 (checkered red, plain brown, etc.)\n\nNone of the options match 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to count the number of each phenotype without considering the exact probabilities, perhaps simplifying. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me re-examine the Punnett square approach. The F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of the F1 (CcBb) parents. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBb (homozygous)\n- 50% CcBB (heterozygous)\n- 25% ccBb (homozygous recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because F1 is CcBb, so when crossed, the F2 will include all possible gametes, leading to a distribution where each allele is equally likely to be passed on. The correct approach is to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene (C and B) is independently segregating. So for each gene, the possible gametes are C, c, B, b, each with a 25% chance. Therefore, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C locus:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B locus. Since the genes are independent, the combined F2 genotypes are all possible combinations. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. For each bird, if C is present (i.e., not cc), and B is present (i.e., not bb), the bird is phenotypically red and brown. Otherwise, it's a different combination. So the phenotypic ratios are determined by the probabilities of each genotype leading to each phenotype. As previously, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:6\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI.7:5\nJ.2:6\n\nHmm, none of them show 9:3:3:1. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read the question again. It asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The options provided do not include 9:3:3:1, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the options were meant to represent the F1 instead of the F2. But the question specifically asks for F2. Alternatively, perhaps the letters in the options refer to the order of traits. Wait, the problem statement mentions \"checkered\" and \"plain\", which correspond to 'c' and 'b'. So perhaps in the options, 'checkered red' refers to 'c' (plain) and 'red', while 'checkered brown' refers to 'c' (plain) and 'brown'. So the options are structured as follows: \n\nEach option presents four phenotypes, listed as (Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown), with the numbers indicating how many of each are expected. Our correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but the closest matching option is E, which has 3:9:1:3. So perhaps the options are listing the ratio in reverse order. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the checkered and plain colors to be the other way around. If I switch 'c' and 'b', then the phenotypes become:\n\n- Checkered red: 'c' (plain) and 'red'\n- Checkered brown: 'c' (plain) and 'brown'\n- Plain red: 'b' (red) and 'red'\n- Plain brown: 'b' (brown) and 'brown'\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. Let's recalculate the phenotypic ratios under this assumption. \n\nIn this case, the presence of 'c' (checkered) would mean the bird is plain (as 'c' is recessive), and 'b' (plain) would mean the bird is red or brown depending on the other trait. Wait, no\u2014the presence of a dominant allele in 'C' results in red, and the presence of a dominant allele in 'B' results in brown. So regardless of the other trait, a bird with 'C' is red, and a bird with 'B' is brown. So the phenotypes are determined by both traits together. Under this new mapping, the phenotypic ratios would remain the same as before, but the labels change. However, the key point is that the underlying probabilities remain 9:3:3:1. \n\nLooking back at the options, none explicitly state 9:3:3:1. However, option E states 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of our correct ratio. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the options are presented incorrectly or I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the F1 ratio instead of the F2, but the question clearly states F2. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, the closest would be option E, though it's the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to list the ratio in terms of checkered and plain as the primary traits, which would lead to a different outcome. Without further clarity, I'll proceed with the understanding that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E, despite the inversion. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the correct ordering of the letters. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the letters in the options refer to the order of the traits. For instance, option E lists 3:9:1:3, which could mean checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3. That aligns with the correct 9:3:3:1 if we consider that checkered is 'c' and plain is 'b'. So perhaps the options are mislabeled, and the intended correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through J, each providing a phenotypic ratio. Option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratios should be 9:3:3:1. So option E shows a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. That doesn't seem right because higher frequency would correspond to more birds having both traits. So I think option E is incorrect. Another possibility is that the scaling factor is such that each unit represents a certain number of individuals. For example, if we assume 16 birds, then Phenotype A would be 9, B=3, C=3, D=1. But looking at the options, none have exactly 9:3:3:1. Instead, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit either. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, which isn't correct. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which still doesn't match. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is similar to our 3:9:1:3 but inverted. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypes. According to the problem statement:\n\nRed is controlled by C, and brown by B.\n\nSo, the presence of C means red, presence of B means brown. So, a bird that's red (C) and brown (B) will have both traits, which I called Phenotype A. A bird that's red (C) but not brown (B) is Phenotype B. A bird that's not red (c) but is brown (B) is Phenotype C. A bird that's neither is Phenotype D. So the ratios should indeed be 9:3:3:1, as per the calculations above. None of the options directly reflect this, but option E has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. That suggests that perhaps I misinterpreted the question regarding which trait comes first or if the order is reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are swapped. Wait, in the options, option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. This corresponds to the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which would imply that the checkered color (c) and plain color (c) are represented in the opposite way than I thought. Perhaps in the problem, the order was reversed, with checkered coming before red and brown after. Wait, but the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So red is dominant over checkered, and brown is dominant over plain. So the presence of C leads to red, and the presence of B leads to brown. So the initial interpretation seems correct. Hence, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly show that. Wait, checking the options again:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 (checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown)\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:2 (checkered red, plain brown, etc.)\n\nNone of the options match 9:3:3:1. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to count the number of each phenotype without considering the exact probabilities, perhaps simplifying. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me re-examine the Punnett square approach. The F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of the F1 (CcBb) parents. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBb (homozygous)\n- 50% CcBB (heterozygous)\n- 25% ccBb (homozygous recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because F1 is CcBb, so when crossed, the F2 will include all possible gametes, leading to a distribution where each allele is equally likely to be passed on. The correct approach is to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene (C and B) is independently segregating. So for each gene, the possible gametes are C, c, B, b, each with a 25% chance. Therefore, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C locus:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B locus. Since the genes are independent, the combined F2 genotypes are all possible combinations. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. For each bird, if C is present (i.e., not cc), and B is present (i.e., not bb), the bird is phenotypically red and brown. Otherwise, it's a different combination. So the phenotypic ratios are determined by the probabilities of each genotype leading to each phenotype. As previously, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:6\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI.7:5\nJ.2:6\n\nHmm, none of them show 9:3:3:1. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read the question again. It asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The options provided do not include 9:3:3:1, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the options were meant to represent the F1 instead of the F2. But the question specifically asks for F2. Alternatively, perhaps the letters in the options refer to the order of traits. Wait, the problem statement mentions \"checkered\" and \"plain\", which correspond to 'c' and 'b'. So perhaps in the options, 'checkered red' refers to 'c' (plain) and 'red', while 'checkered brown' refers to 'c' (plain) and 'brown'. So the options are structured as follows: \n\nEach option presents four phenotypes, listed as (Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown), with the numbers indicating how many of each are expected. Our correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but the closest matching option is E, which has 3:9:1:3. So perhaps the options are listing the ratio in reverse order. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the checkered and plain colors to be the other way around. If I switch 'c' and 'b', then the phenotypes become:\n\n- Checkered red: 'c' (plain) and 'red'\n- Checkered brown: 'c' (plain) and 'brown'\n- Plain red: 'b' (red) and 'red'\n- Plain brown: 'b' (brown) and 'brown'\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios would be based on the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. Let's recalculate the phenotypic ratios under this assumption. \n\nIn this case, the presence of 'c' (checkered) would mean the bird is plain (as 'c' is recessive), and 'b' (plain) would mean the bird is red or brown depending on the other trait. Wait, no\u2014the presence of a dominant allele in 'C' results in red, and the presence of a dominant allele in 'B' results in brown. So regardless of the other trait, a bird with 'C' is red, and a bird with 'B' is brown. So the phenotypes are determined by both traits together. Under this new mapping, the phenotypic ratios would remain the same as before, but the labels change. However, the key point is that the underlying probabilities remain 9:3:3:1. \n\nLooking back at the options, none explicitly state 9:3:3:1. However, option E states 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of our correct ratio. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the options are presented incorrectly or I've misunderstood the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the F1 ratio instead of the F2, but the question clearly states F2. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, the closest would be option E, though it's the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to list the ratio in terms of checkered and plain as the primary traits, which would lead to a different outcome. Without further clarity, I'll proceed with the understanding that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E, despite the inversion. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the correct ordering of the letters. \n\nAnother angle: perhaps the letters in the options refer to the order of the traits. For instance, option E lists 3:9:1:3, which could mean checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3. That aligns with the correct 9:3:3:1 if we consider that checkered is 'c' and plain is 'b'. So perhaps the options are mislabeled, and the intended correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

    "rollout": " E. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So the ratios are 3:9:1:3. But according to our calculations, it's 9:3:3:1, which simplifies to 3:1:1:0.333. Hmm, that's conflicting. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me re-examine. For each bird, the probability of having both traits is 9/16, only C is 3/16, only B is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Therefore, the ratio of Phenotypes would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking at the options, option J is \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which would correspond to 2:6:3:1, or simplified, 1:3:1.5:0.5. That doesn't align. Option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the exact ratios are different. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which is 5:3:2:6, totaling 16. Option I is \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which is 7:5:1:3, totaling 16. Option J is \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is 2:6:3:1. Option F is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which is 4:4:4:4. Option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which is 1:3:9:3. Option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is 9:3:3:1. Wait, so according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, none of the options have exactly 9:3:3:1. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n- Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nSo option C matches our calculation. But why do the options vary? Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance. Let me double-check. The question states: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" \"Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; black color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective traits. So, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. So the possible phenotypic classes are indeed four, each with distinct combinations. Therefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which is 3:9:1:3. This seems reversed compared to our calculation. Option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which is 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So the ratios are 3:9:1:3. But according to our calculations, it's 9:3:3:1, which simplifies to 3:1:1:0.333. Hmm, that's conflicting. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me re-examine. For each bird, the probability of having both traits is 9/16, only C is 3/16, only B is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Therefore, the ratio of Phenotypes would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking at the options, option J is \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which would correspond to 2:6:3:1, or simplified, 1:3:1.5:0.5. That doesn't align. Option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but the exact ratios are different. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which is 5:3:2:6, totaling 16. Option I is \"Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which is 7:5:1:3, totaling 16. Option J is \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is 2:6:3:1. Option F is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which is 4:4:4:4. Option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which is 1:3:9:3. Option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is 9:3:3:1. Wait, so according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, none of the options have exactly 9:3:3:1. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n- Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nSo option C matches our calculation. But why do the options vary? Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance. Let me double-check. The question states: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" \"Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; black color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective traits. So, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. So the possible phenotypic classes are indeed four, each with distinct combinations. Therefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which is 3:9:1:3. This seems reversed compared to our calculation. Option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" which is 9:3:3:1. So option C matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo all options add up to 16, matching our calculations. Now, we need to determine which option corresponds to the correct phenotypic distribution. From our analysis, the correct distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, I realize that I might have miscalculated the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. The probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Only C: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Only B: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer should reflect this ratio. Among the options, option C states 9:3:3:1, which aligns with our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

But looking at the options, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that's slightly different than what I thought. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the probabilities. Let me double-check. Each bird has two traits. The chance of having both traits is indeed 9/16, only C is 3/16, only B is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But in the options, option C has 9:3:3:1, which matches exactly.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.\n\nWait, according to our calculations, the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking at the options, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that's slightly different than what I thought. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the probabilities. Let me double-check. Each bird has two traits. The chance of having both traits is indeed 9/16, only C is 3/16, only B is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But in the options, option C has 9:3:3:1, which matches exactly. However, the options presented are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo option C matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, in the options, the names are Checkered red vs plain red, and similarly for brown. So, in option C, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. That aligns with our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also fits. Wait, but depending on how the phenotypes are ordered, it might matter. The question lists the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our classification, checkered red corresponds to phenotype B (only C present), checkered brown is C (only B present), plain red is A (both present), and plain brown is D (neither present). So the order in the options would be: 3,9,1,3, which is option E. But option C is 9,3,3,1. Wait, but I think I may have mixed up the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (phenotype B)\n2. Checkered brown (phenotype C)\n3. Plain red (phenotype A)\n4. Plain brown (phenotype D)\n\nSo in terms of counts, if the total is 16, the distribution is 9,3,3,1. So option C is 9,3,3,1. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which would correspond to the reverse order. Depending on how the options list them, the correct answer would be either C or E. But looking back at the options provided, option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which aligns with our calculation. However, another possibility arises: perhaps the count is scaled differently. Wait, no\u2014the calculation shows that the ratio is 9:3:3:1, so the counts would be multiples of these. But in the options, the numbers add up to 16. So option C is 9,3,3,1, which sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the order matters. The phenotypes listed in the options are: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Our classification assigns these as B, C, A, D respectively. So in terms of the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to B:C:A:D as 9:3:3:1, matching our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3. Hmm, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which fits. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also fits. Wait, but depending on how the phenotypes are ordered, it might matter. The question lists the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our classification, checkered red corresponds to phenotype B (only C present), checkered brown is C (only B present), plain red is A (both present), and plain brown is D (neither present). So the order in the options would be: 3,9,1,3, which is option E. But option C is 9,3,3,1. Wait, but I think I may have mixed up the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (phenotype B)\n2. Checkered brown (phenotype C)\n3. Plain red (phenotype A)\n4. Plain brown (phenotype D)\n\nSo in terms of counts, if the total is 16, the distribution is 9,3,3,1. So option C is 9,3,3,1. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which would correspond to the reverse order. Depending on how the options list them, the correct answer would be either C or E. But looking back at the options provided, option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which aligns with our calculation. However, another possibility arises: perhaps the count is scaled differently. Wait, no\u2014the calculation shows that the ratio is 9:3:3:1, so the counts would be multiples of these. But in the options, the numbers add up to 16. So option C is 9,3,3,1, which sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the order matters. The phenotypes listed in the options are: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Our classification assigns these as B, C, A, D respectively. So in terms of the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to B:C:A:D as 9:3:3:1, matching our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich is exactly 1:3:9:3 ratio. Wait, no, the sum is 1+3+9+3=16, which aligns with our calculations. So the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3. Looking back at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also sums to 16. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which sums to 16, but the ratios are equal. Option D is 1:1:3:9, summing to 14. Option C is 9:3:3:1, summing to 16. So option C is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts for one phenotype, 3 for another, etc. But according to our earlier calculation, the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is equivalent to option C's ratio when scaled by a factor of 3. Because option C is 9:3:3:1, which is 9 times each unit, making the ratio effectively 1:1:1:1, which contradicts our previous conclusion.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to 1 part (plain), 3 parts (plain), 9 parts (checkered brown?), etc. Wait, no\u2014the option E states:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich is exactly 1:3:9:3 ratio. Wait, no, the sum is 1+3+9+3=16, which aligns with our calculations. So the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3. Looking back at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also sums to 16. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which sums to 16, but the ratios are equal. Option D is 1:1:3:9, summing to 14. Option C is 9:3:3:1, summing to 16. So option C is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts for one phenotype, 3 for another, etc. But according to our earlier calculation, the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is equivalent to option C's ratio when scaled by a factor of 3. Because option C is 9:3:3:1, which is 9 times each unit, making the ratio effectively 1:1:1:1, which contradicts our previous conclusion. Wait, no\u2014the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is similar to option C but without the scaling factor. Wait, no, 1:3:9:3 is the same as option C (9:3:3:1) divided by 3. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\nA.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A through H, each giving different ratios.",
    "rollout": " A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me look at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. But in terms of actual counts, the number of checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D (neither trait present), which is 1 part, so 1 unit. Checkered brown would be Phenotype B (only C), 3 units. Plain red would be Phenotype C (only B), 3 units. Plain brown would be Phenotype A (both traits), 9 units. So the ratio is 1:3:3:9. But the options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So according to this, the ratio would be checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (9). Which corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014the order is checkered red first, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. According to our count, checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. So the ratio is 1:3:3:9. Option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which doesn't align. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the probabilities. For a bird to have both C and B present (Phenotype A), the probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. For only C present (Phenotype B), it's (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. So the number of birds in each phenotype would be 9k, 3k, 3k, k, where k is a scaling factor. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would imply a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which doesn't fit our calculations. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me look at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. But in terms of actual counts, the number of checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D (neither trait present), which is 1 part, so 1 unit. Checkered brown would be Phenotype B (only C), 3 units. Plain red would be Phenotype C (only B), 3 units. Plain brown would be Phenotype A (both traits), 9 units. So the ratio is 1:3:3:9. But the options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So according to this, the ratio would be checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (9). Which corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014the order is checkered red first, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. According to our count, checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. So the ratio is 1:3:3:9. Option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which doesn't align. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the probabilities. For a bird to have both C and B present (Phenotype A), the probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. For only C present (Phenotype B), it's (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. So the number of birds in each phenotype would be 9k, 3k, 3k, k, where k is a scaling factor. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would imply a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which doesn't fit our calculations. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, but let's check the options again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nSo option C is 9,3,3,1, which fits our calculation.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2014which corresponds to Phenotype C (only B), Phenotype B (only C), Phenotype A (both traits), and Phenotype D (neither).",
    "rollout": " Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2014which corresponds to Phenotype C (only B), Phenotype B (only C), Phenotype A (both traits), and Phenotype D (neither).

But according to our breakdown, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype C (only B), checkered brown is Phenotype B (only C), plain red is Phenotype A (both traits), and plain brown is Phenotype D (neither). So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype C): 3\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype B): 9\n- Plain red (Phenotype A): 9 (Wait, no\u2014if the original options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, then according to our breakdown, checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 1. Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+9+1=22, but the total should be N, which is not specified. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, going back, the total number of offspring would be 16 parts if we consider the probabilities as 9,3,3,1. So if we take 16 as the total, but the options don't have denominators of 16. Instead, looking at option E: 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. But the options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our breakdown, checkered red (Phenotype C) is 3, checkered brown (Phenotype B) is 9, plain red (Phenotype A) is 9, and plain brown (Phenotype D) is 1. But that would mean checkered red and checkered brown are both 3, which contradicts the standard classification where checkered is when both are recessive, and brown is when B is dominant. Wait, no, in our analysis, checkered is when both B alleles are recessive (phenotype D), and brown is when B is dominant (phenotype B). Similarly, checkered red is when C is recessive (phenotype C). Wait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n- Phenotype B: C present, B not present \u2192 red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: C not present, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n- Phenotype D: neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nSo, the pheno types are ordered as follows in the options: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Which corresponds to:\n\n- checkered red: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- checkered brown: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- plain red: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- plain brown: Phenotype D (checkered and brown)\n\nNow, according to our calculations:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): 9\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown): 9\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1\n\nBut the options don't list these in the order checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Instead, they list them as:\n\nOption E: checkered red (which would be Phenotype C, 9), checkered brown (Phenotype B, 3), plain red (Phenotype A, 9), plain brown (Phenotype D, 1).\n\nSo the counts are 9,3,9,1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2014which corresponds to Phenotype C (only B), Phenotype B (only C), Phenotype A (both traits), and Phenotype D (neither). Wait, no: according to our earlier breakdown:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits \u2192 count = 9\n- Phenotype B: only C \u2192 count = 3\n- Phenotype C: only B \u2192 count = 3\n- Phenotype D: neither \u2192 count = 1\n\nSo the order in the options is checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But according to our breakdown, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype C (only B), checkered brown is Phenotype B (only C), plain red is Phenotype A (both traits), and plain brown is Phenotype D (neither). So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype C): 3\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype B): 9\n- Plain red (Phenotype A): 9 (Wait, no\u2014if the original options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, then according to our breakdown, checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, plain red is 9, and plain brown is 1. Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+9+1=22, but the total should be N, which is not specified. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, going back, the total number of offspring would be 16 parts if we consider the probabilities as 9,3,3,1. So if we take 16 as the total, but the options don't have denominators of 16. Instead, looking at option E: 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. But the options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our breakdown, checkered red (Phenotype C) is 3, checkered brown (Phenotype B) is 9, plain red (Phenotype A) is 9, and plain brown (Phenotype D) is 1. But that would mean checkered red and checkered brown are both 3, which contradicts the standard classification where checkered is when both are recessive, and brown is when B is dominant. Wait, no, in our analysis, checkered is when both B alleles are recessive (phenotype D), and brown is when B is dominant (phenotype B). Similarly, checkered red is when C is recessive (phenotype C). Wait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n- Phenotype B: C present, B not present \u2192 red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: C not present, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n- Phenotype D: neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nSo, the pheno types are ordered as follows in the options: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Which corresponds to:\n\n- checkered red: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- checkered brown: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- plain red: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- plain brown: Phenotype D (checkered and brown)\n\nNow, according to our calculations:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): 9\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown): 9\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1\n\nBut the options don't list these in the order checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Instead, they list them as:\n\nOption E: checkered red (which would be Phenotype C, 9), checkered brown (Phenotype B, 3), plain red (Phenotype A, 9), plain brown (Phenotype D, 1).\n\nSo the counts are 9,3,9,1.

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

But looking at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that's exactly what we've got. So the answer should be option E, but wait no\u2014the options are labeled A through H, and the user listed them as:\n\nA.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A to J, each with different ratios.",
    "rollout": " A to J, each with different ratios. Let's look at option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" Summing up: 3+9+1+3=16. So in terms of parts, this corresponds to the 1:3:3:1 ratio, which matches our earlier analysis. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, where:\n\n- Checkered red (plain brown) : 1 part\n- Checkered brown (plain red) : 3 parts\n- Plain red (checkered brown) : 3 parts\n- Plain brown (checkered red) : 1 part Wait, no, according to the breakdown earlier, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits present \u2192 9 parts (checkered red)\n- Phenotype B: only C \u2192 3 parts (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype C: only B \u2192 3 parts (plain red)\n- Phenotype D: neither \u2192 1 part (plain brown)\n\nSo in terms of phenotypic ratio, it's 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Wait, perhaps I got the order wrong. Option E lists checkered red (which is A) as 3, checkered brown (B) as 9, plain red (C) as 1, plain brown (D) as 3. But according to our earlier count, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the options are inverted. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the genetic ratio. So, according to our calculation, the genetic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but the phenotypic ratio depends on the expression of these traits. So the actual phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of birds expressing each phenotype. According to the options, option E has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 when reversed. But looking back, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the genetic ratio. So, for each phenotype, the count is as follows: Phenotype A (both traits) is 9, Phenotype B (only C) is 3, Phenotype C (only B) is 3, Phenotype D (none) is 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options list them differently. Option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which aligns with our 3:9:1:3 ratio. Wait, no, that's not matching. Our calculation was 9:3:3:1, but option E has 3:9:1:3. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the number of birds with each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype A): 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (phenotype B): 3 parts\n- Plain red (phenotype C): 3 parts\n- Plain brown (phenotype D): 1 part\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options presented do not include this exactly. Let's review the options again:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 This is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we have. Option B: 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option G: 12:2:2:2 \u2013 Way higher than our 9:3:3:1. Option H: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option I: 7:5:1:3 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option J: 2:6:3:1 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option A: 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option C: 9:3:3:1 \u2013 This matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A to J, each with different ratios. Let's look at option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" Summing up: 3+9+1+3=16. So in terms of parts, this corresponds to the 1:3:3:1 ratio, which matches our earlier analysis. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, where:\n\n- Checkered red (plain brown) : 1 part\n- Checkered brown (plain red) : 3 parts\n- Plain red (checkered brown) : 3 parts\n- Plain brown (checkered red) : 1 part Wait, no, according to the breakdown earlier, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits present \u2192 9 parts (checkered red)\n- Phenotype B: only C \u2192 3 parts (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype C: only B \u2192 3 parts (plain red)\n- Phenotype D: neither \u2192 1 part (plain brown)\n\nSo in terms of phenotypic ratio, it's 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Wait, perhaps I got the order wrong. Option E lists checkered red (which is A) as 3, checkered brown (B) as 9, plain red (C) as 1, plain brown (D) as 3. But according to our earlier count, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the options are inverted. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the genetic ratio. So, according to our calculation, the genetic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but the phenotypic ratio depends on the expression of these traits. So the actual phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of birds expressing each phenotype. According to the options, option E has a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 when reversed. But looking back, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the genetic ratio. So, for each phenotype, the count is as follows: Phenotype A (both traits) is 9, Phenotype B (only C) is 3, Phenotype C (only B) is 3, Phenotype D (none) is 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options list them differently. Option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which aligns with our 3:9:1:3 ratio. Wait, no, that's not matching. Our calculation was 9:3:3:1, but option E has 3:9:1:3. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the number of birds with each phenotype is as follows:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype A): 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (phenotype B): 3 parts\n- Plain red (phenotype C): 3 parts\n- Plain brown (phenotype D): 1 part\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options presented do not include this exactly. Let's review the options again:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 This is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we have. Option B: 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option G: 12:2:2:2 \u2013 Way higher than our 9:3:3:1. Option H: 5:3:2:6 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option I: 7:5:1:3 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option J: 2:6:3:1 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option A: 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Doesn't fit. Option C: 9:3:3:1 \u2013 This matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through J, with various ratios. Let me look at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but the ratios are 6:2:6:2.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't seem right.\n\nC. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18.\n\nD. 2,6,3,9 \u2192 Sum 20.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nSo E is the one that matches our calculations.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: Option E says 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which aligns with our calculation: 3+9+1+3=16, which is the total number of F2 offspring. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes.

When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nLooking back:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo in my calculation, the proportions are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E, where checkered red is 9/16 of the population, checkered brown 3/16, plain red 3/16, and plain brown 1/16. But looking at option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This aligns with 9:3:3:1, scaled appropriately if the total number of offspring is 16. So option E matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2013 sum to 16. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 sum 16. C. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 sum 16. D. 1,3,9,3 \u2013 sum 16. E. 3,9,1,3 \u2013 sum 16. So all options add up to 16. Now, according to our calculations, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the options, option C states \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, no, that's not matching. Our calculation shows 9 for both C and B present, 3 for only C, 3 for only B, and 1 for neither. So the correct order is Checkered red (phenotype A) =9, Checkered brown (B)=3, Plain red (C)=3, Plain brown (D)=1. But none of the options exactly state this. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to Checkered red:9, Checkered brown:3, Plain red:3, Plain brown:1. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A) 6,2,6,2; B)8,4,0,4; C)9,3,3,1; D)1,3,9,3; E)3,9,1,3.\n\nIn our analysis, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking at the options, option C states \"Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1\", which matches our ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through H, each giving a different ratio. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing up to 16, which aligns with our calculation. So the expected ratios would be checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, which fits.",
    "rollout": " A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, which fits. So the correct answer would be A. Because 6+2+6+2=16, which corresponds to the 9/16, 3/16, etc. But wait, according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9/16, which is 9, Phenotype B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. So the ratios would be 9:3:3:1, which is similar to option A. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2 if scaled down by dividing each by 2, but the original counts would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options, option A states \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2,\" which sums to 16. But in reality, the correct count should be 9:3:3:1, which would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But none of the options match exactly unless we're scaling down. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the phenotypes are counted differently. Alternatively, maybe the letters refer to the order of the traits, so checkered red comes before plain red, and similarly for brown. Wait, but according to the options, the letters represent the order of the phenotypes as described, so the first option would correspond to the highest frequency. So in our case, checkered red would be 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That corresponds to option G, which lists checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the probabilities. For a bird to have both C and B present (red and brown), the probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. For only C present: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Only B: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Neither: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So the counts are 9, 3, 3, 1. None of the options directly match this, but option G mentions checkered red 12, which is higher than our 9, suggesting I might have misapplied the logic. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance applies differently. Wait, maybe the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene results in the trait being expressed, but in this case, since both genes are required for each trait, the presence of any dominant allele in either gene would lead to the respective trait. But that doesn't change the probabilities. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the confusion arises because the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including those that might not fit typical Mendelian ratios. Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one aligns with the calculations. Option A: 6, 2, 6, 2. Sum is 16, which fits our fraction of 9:3:3:1. Option G has 12,2,2,0 which sums to 16 as well, but the distribution is different. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me try again. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is:\n\n- For C: 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- For B: 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability of having both traits (C and B present) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThe probability of only C present is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\nOnly B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\nNeither: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Thus, among the options, option A states 6,2,6,2\u2014which is half of what we have. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't add up to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16 but is the reverse. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1,7,5,3, which doesn't fit. Option C is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which sums to 16 but shows all equal, which isn't the case here. Option B is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16 and follows the 9:3:3:1 ratio if we divide each by 1.5. Wait, but 9 divided by 1.5 is 6, 3 divided by 1.5 is 2, etc. So option B would imply that the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, which matches our 9:3:3:1 if we adjust the scale. But the way the options are presented, they don't mention scaling. Instead, they present the exact counts. Therefore, the correct option is the one that reflects the exact probabilities without scaling. Since none of the options perfectly reflect 9:3:3:1, but option A is 6:2:6:2, which is a simplified version, but perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that reverses the order. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and the correct ratio is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would mean checkered red is 3, which contradicts our calculation of 9. Unless I've confused the roles of the genes. Alternatively, perhaps the order of the traits matters, making checkered red come after checkered brown, but that wouldn't affect the ratio itself. Another possibility is that I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me re-examine the possible phenotypes and their counts.\n\nIf the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, then the expected phenotypic ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. However, none of the options directly state this. Option A presents the counts as 6:2:6:2, which is exactly half of our desired ratio (9:3:3:1 becomes 6:2:6:2 when divided by 1.5). This suggests that the question might expect the ratio to be simplified, possibly indicating that the counts are relative to a larger population, but the actual ratio remains 9:3:3:1. However, since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that's reversed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, another thought: maybe the checkered phenotype refers to the recessive condition in both genes, while plain refers to the dominant in one. So the checkered phenotype would be when both B and b are present (recessive). So checkered red would be when both C and B are present (since C is dominant, red; B is recessive, checkered). Checkered brown would be when C is dominant (red) and B is recessive (checkered). Plain red would be when C is recessive (plain) and B is dominant (brown). Plain brown would be when C is recessive (plain) and B is recessive (checkered). Wait, that changes the analysis. So now, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C (dominant) and B (recessive) \u2192 probability 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: C (dominant) and B (recessive) \u2192 same as above, 3/16\n- Plain red: C (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Plain brown: C (recessive) and B (recessive) \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio becomes 3:3:3:1, but that still doesn't fit any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the terminology. Another approach: perhaps the checkered phenotype refers to having both B and b, and the plain refers to having at least one non-checkered allele. But I think I'm complicating things too much. Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible answer is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that's inconsistent with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't include this. Therefore, I might choose option E as the closest, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the discrepancy, because it's the only one with 3 and 9, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 when halved. However, I'm unsure. Given the uncertainty, I think the best choice is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, which fits. So the correct answer would be A. Because 6+2+6+2=16, which corresponds to the 9/16, 3/16, etc. But wait, according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9/16, which is 9, Phenotype B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. So the ratios would be 9:3:3:1, which is similar to option A. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2 if scaled down by dividing each by 2, but the original counts would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options, option A states \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2,\" which sums to 16. But in reality, the correct count should be 9:3:3:1, which would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But none of the options match exactly unless we're scaling down. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the phenotypes are counted differently. Alternatively, maybe the letters refer to the order of the traits, so checkered red comes before plain red, and similarly for brown. Wait, but according to the options, the letters represent the order of the phenotypes as described, so the first option would correspond to the highest frequency. So in our case, checkered red would be 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That corresponds to option G, which lists checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the probabilities. For a bird to have both C and B present (red and brown), the probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. For only C present: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Only B: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Neither: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So the counts are 9, 3, 3, 1. None of the options directly match this, but option G mentions checkered red 12, which is higher than our 9, suggesting I might have misapplied the logic. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance applies differently. Wait, maybe the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene results in the trait being expressed, but in this case, since both genes are required for each trait, the presence of any dominant allele in either gene would lead to the respective trait. But that doesn't change the probabilities. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the confusion arises because the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including those that might not fit typical Mendelian ratios. Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one aligns with the calculations. Option A: 6, 2, 6, 2. Sum is 16, which fits our fraction of 9:3:3:1. Option G has 12,2,2,0 which sums to 16 as well, but the distribution is different. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me try again. For each gene, the probability of having at least one dominant allele is:\n\n- For C: 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n- For B: 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability of having both traits (C and B present) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThe probability of only C present is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\nOnly B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\nNeither: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Thus, among the options, option A states 6,2,6,2\u2014which is half of what we have. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't add up to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16 but is the reverse. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which doesn't fit. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option D is 1,7,5,3, which doesn't fit. Option C is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which sums to 16 but shows all equal, which isn't the case here. Option B is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16 and follows the 9:3:3:1 ratio if we divide each by 1.5. Wait, but 9 divided by 1.5 is 6, 3 divided by 1.5 is 2, etc. So option B would imply that the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, which matches our 9:3:3:1 if we adjust the scale. But the way the options are presented, they don't mention scaling. Instead, they present the exact counts. Therefore, the correct option is the one that reflects the exact probabilities without scaling. Since none of the options perfectly reflect 9:3:3:1, but option A is 6:2:6:2, which is a simplified version, but perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that reverses the order. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question and the correct ratio is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would mean checkered red is 3, which contradicts our calculation of 9. Unless I've confused the roles of the genes. Alternatively, perhaps the order of the traits matters, making checkered red come after checkered brown, but that wouldn't affect the ratio itself. Another possibility is that I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me re-examine the possible phenotypes and their counts.\n\nIf the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, then the expected phenotypic ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. However, none of the options directly state this. Option A presents the counts as 6:2:6:2, which is exactly half of our desired ratio (9:3:3:1 becomes 6:2:6:2 when divided by 1.5). This suggests that the question might expect the ratio to be simplified, possibly indicating that the counts are relative to a larger population, but the actual ratio remains 9:3:3:1. However, since none of the options match exactly, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that's reversed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, another thought: maybe the checkered phenotype refers to the recessive condition in both genes, while plain refers to the dominant in one. So the checkered phenotype would be when both B and b are present (recessive). So checkered red would be when both C and B are present (since C is dominant, red; B is recessive, checkered). Checkered brown would be when C is dominant (red) and B is recessive (checkered). Plain red would be when C is recessive (plain) and B is dominant (brown). Plain brown would be when C is recessive (plain) and B is recessive (checkered). Wait, that changes the analysis. So now, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C (dominant) and B (recessive) \u2192 probability 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: C (dominant) and B (recessive) \u2192 same as above, 3/16\n- Plain red: C (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Plain brown: C (recessive) and B (recessive) \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio becomes 3:3:3:1, but that still doesn't fit any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the terminology. Another approach: perhaps the checkered phenotype refers to having both B and b, and the plain refers to having at least one non-checkered allele. But I think I'm complicating things too much. Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible answer is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that's inconsistent with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't include this. Therefore, I might choose option E as the closest, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the discrepancy, because it's the only one with 3 and 9, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 when halved. However, I'm unsure. Given the uncertainty, I think the best choice is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A) checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.",
    "rollout": " A) checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Total: 16. B) checkered red 8, etc.\u2014total 16. C) 9,3,3,1\u219216. D) 1,3,9,3\u219216. E) 3,9,1,3\u219216. All add up to 16. So the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Because option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our analysis, checkered red is Phenotype B (only C), which is 3 parts, and checkered brown is Phenotype C (only B), also 3 parts. Whereas plain red is Phenotype D (neither C nor B), which is 1 part, and plain brown is Phenotype A (both C and B), 9 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nThat fits exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A: 6,2,2,2; B:6,2,4,2; C:9,3,3,1; D:1,3,7,3; E:3,9,1,3.",

Wait, the phenotypic ratios should be based on the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume 16 individuals, the counts would be 9,3,3,1. But the options are presented without denominators, so perhaps the question assumes a certain scaling. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider all possible phenotypes equally, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but that's unlikely given the presence of dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A: 6,2,2,2; B:6,2,4,2; C:9,3,3,1; D:1,3,7,3; E:3,9,1,3. Our calculations suggest 9,3,3,1, which matches option C. But looking back, I might have miscalculated. Let me double-check. Wait, the phenotypic ratios should be based on the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume 16 individuals, the counts would be 9,3,3,1.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele).

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A: 6,2,2,2; E:3,9,1,3.",
    "rollout": " A: 6,2,2,2; E:3,9,1,3. Hmm, but according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is 3,9,1,3\u2014which is half of what we have. Perhaps the scale factor is applied such that each 'part' corresponds to a certain number of birds. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio. Let me double-check. Another approach is to list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (A)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (B)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown (C)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown (B)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (B)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (C)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (A)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red (A)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red (A)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n- Checkered red: 3 (genotypes 7,8,9)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (genotypes 1,4,5)\n- Plain brown: 3 (genotypes 2,6)\n- Plain red: 1 (genotype 3)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:3:3:1, which simplifies to 3:3:3:1. But the options given do not include this exact ratio. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is different. Wait, perhaps the scale factor is applied incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question regarding dominance. Let me re-examine the dominance rules: - C is dominant over c, so any C allele results in red pigment.\n- B is dominant over b, so any B allele results in brown color.\n\nTherefore, the presence of either dominant allele results in the respective trait. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. Thus, the correct ratio is indeed 3:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none directly match this. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is twice the ratio of the others. Perhaps the scale factor was multiplied by 3, making each category count three times larger than what we've calculated. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that each bird has two traits, leading to four phenotypes, each occurring with a certain frequency. But according to our analysis, the correct ratio is 3:3:3:1, which is not among the options. However, looking back, option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16, matching our previous calculation. It seems the intended answer might be option E, possibly due to a misunderstanding in dominance or in the way the phenotypes are counted. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the count without scaling, so the ratio 9:3:3:1 would imply option E scaled by 3, giving 9,3,1,3. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of checkered to plain versus red to brown, but that complicates things further. Without more context, I think the best choice among the options is E, despite my confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and just look at the number of each genotype, resulting in a ratio of 3:3:3:1, which again isn't an option. Wait, let me read the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nEach option sums to 16. Our correct ratio is 3:3:3:1, which is not among the options. However, if we interpret the question differently, perhaps considering only the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: Any bird with at least one C or one B \u2192 All except plain red\nBut that doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the presence of one dominant trait, not both. For example, checking for at least one dominant allele in either gene, but that still wouldn't change the overall ratio. Alternatively, maybe the problem treats the two genes separately and asks for the ratio within each gene, but that also doesn't seem to align with the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is E, as it reflects the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which could indicate that the scale factor is multiplied by 3, making each phenotype count three times higher than our calculated values. But I'm not entirely confident, so I'll go with option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A: 6,2,2,2; E:3,9,1,3. Hmm, but according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is 3,9,1,3\u2014which is half of what we have. Perhaps the scale factor is applied such that each 'part' corresponds to a certain number of birds. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio. Let me double-check. Another approach is to list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (A)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (B)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown (C)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown (B)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (B)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (C)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (A)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red (A)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red (A)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n- Checkered red: 3 (genotypes 7,8,9)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (genotypes 1,4,5)\n- Plain brown: 3 (genotypes 2,6)\n- Plain red: 1 (genotype 3)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:3:3:1, which simplifies to 3:3:3:1. But the options given do not include this exact ratio. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is different. Wait, perhaps the scale factor is applied incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question regarding dominance. Let me re-examine the dominance rules: - C is dominant over c, so any C allele results in red pigment.\n- B is dominant over b, so any B allele results in brown color.\n\nTherefore, the presence of either dominant allele results in the respective trait. So the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. Thus, the correct ratio is indeed 3:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none directly match this. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is twice the ratio of the others. Perhaps the scale factor was multiplied by 3, making each category count three times larger than what we've calculated. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that each bird has two traits, leading to four phenotypes, each occurring with a certain frequency. But according to our analysis, the correct ratio is 3:3:3:1, which is not among the options. However, looking back, option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16, matching our previous calculation. It seems the intended answer might be option E, possibly due to a misunderstanding in dominance or in the way the phenotypes are counted. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the count without scaling, so the ratio 9:3:3:1 would imply option E scaled by 3, giving 9,3,1,3. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of checkered to plain versus red to brown, but that complicates things further. Without more context, I think the best choice among the options is E, despite my confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance and just look at the number of each genotype, resulting in a ratio of 3:3:3:1, which again isn't an option. Wait, let me read the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nEach option sums to 16. Our correct ratio is 3:3:3:1, which is not among the options. However, if we interpret the question differently, perhaps considering only the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: Any bird with at least one C or one B \u2192 All except plain red\nBut that doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the presence of one dominant trait, not both. For example, checking for at least one dominant allele in either gene, but that still wouldn't change the overall ratio. Alternatively, maybe the problem treats the two genes separately and asks for the ratio within each gene, but that also doesn't seem to align with the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is E, as it reflects the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which could indicate that the scale factor is multiplied by 3, making each phenotype count three times higher than our calculated values. But I'm not entirely confident, so I'll go with option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

But looking back at the options, option C is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. Oh, wait! Because in reality, the phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross where both traits are segregating is typically 9:3:3:1, but sometimes the dominant for each trait combines. However, in this case, the presence of either dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C lists 9:3:3:1, which would mean checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3. Hmm, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, option C is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. Oh, wait! Because in reality, the phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross where both traits are segregating is typically 9:3:3:1, but sometimes the dominant for each trait combines. However, in this case, the presence of either dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C lists 9:3:3:1, which would mean checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A to J, each with a certain count. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to our calculation of 9, 3, 3, 1. So that fits. So the phenotypic ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9, which matches option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to 1,3,9,3 for each phenotype, totaling 16. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:9:3. Wait, but looking back, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. So the order is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. From our calculations: checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown 3 parts, plain red 9 parts, plain brown 3 parts. So the ratio is 1:3:9:3. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which is exactly what we have.\n\nSo the answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.

We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: Option E: 3,9,1,3, totaling 16. But the question asks for the ratio, not the count. So the ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75, but looking at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds exactly to the fraction we've calculated. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo option C sums to 16, which aligns with our calculations. Now, looking at each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits present \u2192 9 parts \u2192 Option C has 9 checkered red and 3 plain red. Hmm, wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, hold on. I thought checkered red was when both C and B are recessive (cc and bb), but according to our earlier analysis, the phenotypes are based on whether C and B are present or not.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered (c and b) \u2192 both genes are recessive\n- Plain (c and b) \u2192 both genes are recessive\n- Brown (B and b) \u2192 at least one B allele\n- Red (C and b) \u2192 at least one C allele\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C allele (C_), it's red.\n- If a bird has at least one B allele (B_), it's brown.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown (Phenotype 1)\n2. Only C present (not B) \u2192 Red and Checkered (Phenotype 2)\n3. Only B present (not C) \u2192 Plain and Brown (Phenotype 3)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain and Checkered (Phenotype 4)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each class are:\n\n- Pheno 1: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- Pheno 2: Only C present \u2192 (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- Pheno 3: Only B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- Pheno 4: Neither \u2192 (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nTo translate these probabilities into counts, assume a large number of offspring, say 16:\n\n- Pheno 1: 9\n- Pheno 2: 3\n- Pheno 3: 3\n- Pheno 4: 1\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This corresponds to Pheno 1, Pheno 2, Pheno 3, Pheno 4 respectively.\n\nBut wait, in the options, the pheno names seem to mix up. Option C states \"checkered red 9\", which would correspond to Pheno 1, and \"checkered brown 3\" which would be Pheno 2. Yes, that matches. So option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.",
    "rollout": " A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3. So according to my calculations, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But wait, looking back, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match what I got. I thought it was 9:3:3:1. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's double-check. The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC: C present \u2192 red\n- Cc: C present \u2192 red\n- cc: c present \u2192 plain\n- bb: B present \u2192 brown\n- bb: B present \u2192 brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (cc) and Brown (bb): Phenotype 2\n- Checkered (cc) and Red (bb): Phenotype 3\n- Plain (cc) and Brown (bb): Phenotype 4\n- Plain (cc) and Red (bb): Phenotype 1\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% bb (brown)\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- 25% checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- 25% checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- 25% plain red (phenotype 3)\n- 25% plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this. Wait, maybe the question is asking about the ratio of the four phenotypes combined, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds in each phenotype, assuming equal distribution among the four. But none of the options match this exactly. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which would imply that the total is 16. Perhaps the scale factor is such that each unit represents 1 bird, leading to 9:3:3:1. But none of the options have 16 as the total. Wait, the options list the totals as follows:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo all options sum to 16, implying that each unit is a bird. So perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But in reality, the F2 ratio is 1:1:1:1, which is not listed. This suggests that I may have misunderstood the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question states: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" \u2014 that would mean a ratio of 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But that doesn't align with my previous calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C, but that contradicts my understanding. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. Let me clarify: In dihybrid crosses, each gene is considered separately. So for each bird, the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio for each gene pair is 3:1. Since there are two independent genes, the overall ratio combines them multiplicatively, giving a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but the options don't reflect this unless the scale is adjusted. If the question expects the F2 ratio in terms of phenotypic classes without considering dominance, perhaps it's different. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the total number of birds in each phenotype category, including those that don't have both traits, but that doesn't fit the standard dihybrid analysis.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the correct answer is option C, which reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio, despite my earlier misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Another possibility is that the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, but ignoring the recessive ones, leading to a different ratio. However, that doesn't align with typical Mendelian ratios.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is asking about the number of birds with each phenotype, not the ratio in terms of percentages. So if each bird has a certain probability, the expected count is based on that. For example, if each bird has a 25% chance to be in each of the four phenotypes, then the expected counts would be 4 birds in each phenotype, totaling 16. But the options do not have 4 in each; instead, they have higher numbers. So perhaps each bird's contribution is scaled up by a factor, making the counts larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, but that also doesn't fit 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total number of birds with each phenotype, including those that lack one trait, but that doesn't fit the typical dihybrid ratio.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- Parents: CC BB and cc bb\n- F1: CcBb\n- F2: 25% CC (red), 25% Cc (red), 25% cc (plain), 25% bb (brown)\n- Phenotypes:\n  - CC: checkered red (1)\n  - Cc: checkered red (2)\n  - cc: plain red (3)\n  - bb: plain brown (4)\n- So, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect this.\n- Alternatively, if the question is considering the total number of birds in each phenotype group without considering dominance, it might be different, but that's unclear.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which lists the ratio as 9:3:3:1, assuming each bird's phenotype is counted based on the presence of dominant alleles without considering the other, but that doesn't align with standard Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their setup, and the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, making option C correct. But without further clarification, I'll proceed with option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3. So according to my calculations, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But wait, looking back, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match what I got. I thought it was 9:3:3:1. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's double-check. The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC: C present \u2192 red\n- Cc: C present \u2192 red\n- cc: c present \u2192 plain\n- bb: B present \u2192 brown\n- bb: B present \u2192 brown\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (cc) and Brown (bb): Phenotype 2\n- Checkered (cc) and Red (bb): Phenotype 3\n- Plain (cc) and Brown (bb): Phenotype 4\n- Plain (cc) and Red (bb): Phenotype 1\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 25% bb (brown)\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- 25% checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- 25% checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- 25% plain red (phenotype 3)\n- 25% plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 1:1:1:1. But the options don't include this. Wait, maybe the question is asking about the ratio of the four phenotypes combined, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds in each phenotype, assuming equal distribution among the four. But none of the options match this exactly. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which would imply that the total is 16. Perhaps the scale factor is such that each unit represents 1 bird, leading to 9:3:3:1. But none of the options have 16 as the total. Wait, the options list the totals as follows:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo all options sum to 16, implying that each unit is a bird. So perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But in reality, the F2 ratio is 1:1:1:1, which is not listed. This suggests that I may have misunderstood the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question states: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" \u2014 that would mean a ratio of 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But that doesn't align with my previous calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C, but that contradicts my understanding. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dominance. Let me clarify: In dihybrid crosses, each gene is considered separately. So for each bird, the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio for each gene pair is 3:1. Since there are two independent genes, the overall ratio combines them multiplicatively, giving a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but the options don't reflect this unless the scale is adjusted. If the question expects the F2 ratio in terms of phenotypic classes without considering dominance, perhaps it's different. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the total number of birds in each phenotype category, including those that don't have both traits, but that doesn't fit the standard dihybrid analysis.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the correct answer is option C, which reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio, despite my earlier misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Another possibility is that the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, but ignoring the recessive ones, leading to a different ratio. However, that doesn't align with typical Mendelian ratios.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is asking about the number of birds with each phenotype, not the ratio in terms of percentages. So if each bird has a certain probability, the expected count is based on that. For example, if each bird has a 25% chance to be in each of the four phenotypes, then the expected counts would be 4 birds in each phenotype, totaling 16. But the options do not have 4 in each; instead, they have higher numbers. So perhaps each bird's contribution is scaled up by a factor, making the counts larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, but that also doesn't fit 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total number of birds with each phenotype, including those that lack one trait, but that doesn't fit the typical dihybrid ratio.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- Parents: CC BB and cc bb\n- F1: CcBb\n- F2: 25% CC (red), 25% Cc (red), 25% cc (plain), 25% bb (brown)\n- Phenotypes:\n  - CC: checkered red (1)\n  - Cc: checkered red (2)\n  - cc: plain red (3)\n  - bb: plain brown (4)\n- So, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect this.\n- Alternatively, if the question is considering the total number of birds in each phenotype group without considering dominance, it might be different, but that's unclear.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which lists the ratio as 9:3:3:1, assuming each bird's phenotype is counted based on the presence of dominant alleles without considering the other, but that doesn't align with standard Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their setup, and the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, making option C correct. But without further clarification, I'll proceed with option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.",
    "rollout": " A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.\n\nWait, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing those gives 3+9+1+3=16, which aligns with our earlier calculation. So according to this, the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E. But let me double-check the calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to look at it is to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. From the Punnett square:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): 9/16 of the offspring\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1/16\n\nSo converting these to whole numbers assuming 16 offspring, we'd have 9,3,3,1 respectively. But the options list them in a different order. Option E lists them as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's exactly what we have here. Because checkered red is phenotype C (plain and brown?), wait no\u2014Wait, hold on. I might have confused the terminology. Let me clarify:\n\nIn our analysis, checkered refers to the recessive phenotype due to both genes being recessive. So:\n\n- Checkered red (C recessive, B recessive): Phenotype D\n- Checkered brown (C recessive, B present): Phenotype C\n- Plain red (C present, B recessive): Phenotype B\n- Plain brown (C present, B present): Phenotype A\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier classification. Earlier, I thought checkered was when both are recessive, but now it looks like checkered is when one is recessive and the other dominant. Hmm, this is a crucial point because it changes the interpretation of the options. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, checkered would mean the recessive phenotype, which requires both alleles to be recessive (cc). So, in terms of coat color:\n\n- Checkered (phenotype): both recessive alleles (cc)\n- Plain (phenotype): at least one dominant allele (Cc, CC)\n- Brown (phenotype): at least one dominant allele (Bb, BB)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: c and b (phenotype D)\n- Plain: c and B (phenotype C)\n- Brown: C and b (phenotype A)\n- Red: C and B (phenotype B)\n\nWait, that's opposite to my previous understanding. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (ccbb): Phenotype D\n2. Plain (ccbB, cBCb, CCbb): Phenotype C\n3. Brown (CCbb, CcBB, CcBb, CC_Bb): Phenotype A\n4. Red (CCBB, CcBB, CcBB, CC_Bb): Phenotype B\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratios would correspond to the probabilities calculated earlier, adjusted for the new terminology.\n\nFrom the earlier analysis, the probabilities were:\n\n- Phenotype D (checkered): 1/16\n- Phenotype C (plain): 3/16\n- Phenotype A (brown): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (red): 3/16\n\nThus, the ratio of Phenotype D : C : A : B is 1:3:9:3. Translating this to counts assuming 16 offspring:\n\n- D: 1\n- C: 3\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n\nWhich would correspond to the phenotypes as follows:\n\n- Checkered (D): 1\n- Plain (C): 3\n- Brown (A): 9\n- Red (B): 3\n\nLooking at the options, option E is: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align because checkered red would be phenotype C, which has 3, and checkered brown is phenotype D, which has 1. Similarly, plain red is phenotype A, which has 9, and plain brown is phenotype B, which has 3. So option E correctly reflects the ratios:\n\n- Checkered red (C): 3\n- Checkered brown (D): 1\n- Plain red (A): 9\n- Plain brown (B): 3\n\nThis matches option E. So the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.\n\nWait, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing those gives 3+9+1+3=16, which aligns with our earlier calculation. So according to this, the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E. But let me double-check the calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to look at it is to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. From the Punnett square:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): 9/16 of the offspring\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1/16\n\nSo converting these to whole numbers assuming 16 offspring, we'd have 9,3,3,1 respectively. But the options list them in a different order. Option E lists them as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's exactly what we have here. Because checkered red is phenotype C (plain and brown?), wait no\u2014Wait, hold on. I might have confused the terminology. Let me clarify:\n\nIn our analysis, checkered refers to the recessive phenotype due to both genes being recessive. So:\n\n- Checkered red (C recessive, B recessive): Phenotype D\n- Checkered brown (C recessive, B present): Phenotype C\n- Plain red (C present, B recessive): Phenotype B\n- Plain brown (C present, B present): Phenotype A\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier classification. Earlier, I thought checkered was when both are recessive, but now it looks like checkered is when one is recessive and the other dominant.

So, in terms of coat color:\n\n- Checkered (phenotype): both recessive alleles (cc)\n- Plain (phenotype): at least one dominant allele (Cc, CC)\n- Brown (phenotype): at least one dominant allele (Bb, BB)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: c and b (phenotype D)\n- Plain: c and B (phenotype C)\n- Brown: C and b (phenotype A)\n- Red: C and B (phenotype B)\n\nWait, that's opposite to my previous understanding. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (ccbb): Phenotype D\n2. Plain (ccbB, cBCb, CCbb): Phenotype C\n3. Brown (CCbb, CcBB, CcBb, CC_Bb): Phenotype A\n4. Red (CCBB, CcBB, CcBB, CC_Bb): Phenotype B\n\nNow, applying this to the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratios would correspond to the probabilities calculated earlier, adjusted for the new terminology.\n\nFrom the earlier analysis, the probabilities were:\n\n- Phenotype D (checkered): 1/16\n- Phenotype C (plain): 3/16\n- Phenotype A (brown): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (red): 3/16\n\nThus, the ratio of Phenotype D : C : A : B is 1:3:9:3. Translating this to counts assuming 16 offspring:\n\n- D: 1\n- C: 3\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n\nWhich would correspond to the phenotypes as follows:\n\n- Checkered (D): 1\n- Plain (C): 3\n- Brown (A): 9\n- Red (B): 3\n\nLooking at the options, option E is: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align because checkered red would be phenotype C, which has 3, and checkered brown is phenotype D, which has 1. Similarly, plain red is phenotype A, which has 9, and plain brown is phenotype B, which has 3. So option E correctly reflects the ratios:\n\n- Checkered red (C): 3\n- Checkered brown (D): 1\n- Plain red (A): 9\n- Plain brown (B): 3\n\nThis matches option E.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

But looking at the options, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me re-examine the probabilities.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nSo according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. But looking at the options, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me re-examine the probabilities.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Let me verify: Phenotype A (both traits present): 9\nPhenotype B (only C): 3\nPhenotype C (only B): 3\nPhenotype D (none): 1\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But wait, that's not what the options list.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns with our calculation of 1:3:3:9. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:9. But looking at the options, option E is exactly that. Let me verify: Phenotype A (both traits present): 9\nPhenotype B (only C): 3\nPhenotype C (only B): 3\nPhenotype D (none): 1\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But wait, that's not what the options list. Option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to 9:3:3:1, but arranged as checkered red (which would be phenotype B?), wait no, let me clarify:\n\nIn our classification:\n- Checkered red: Phenotype B (only C)\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C (only B)\n- Plain red: Phenotype D (neither)\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (both)\n\nBut according to our earlier calculations, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red (phenotype B:3), checkered brown (phenotype C:3), plain red (phenotype D:1), plain brown (phenotype A:9). Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+3+1+9=16. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 1, plain brown is 9. But looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3\u2014which matches our calculation. So the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThat aligns with our calculation: 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to 3 parts checkered red, 9 parts checkered brown, 1 part plain red, 3 parts plain brown. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which matches exactly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A to J, each giving a ratio. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThat corresponds to Phenotype C: 3 parts, Phenotype B:9 parts, Phenotype A:1 part, Phenotype D:3 parts. Which aligns with our calculations: 1:3:3:9. But wait, our probabilities were 1:3:3:9, but scaled to add up to 16. So the ratio is 1:3:3:9, which matches option E.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

However, looking back at the problem statement, the question asks for the F2 generation, which includes the phenotypic ratio after F1 selfing. Wait, but I thought F2 refers to the next generation beyond F1, which would be from F1 x F1. However, sometimes F2 refers to the generation after the second mating, but in this context, since the parents are already crossed once, producing F1, and the question is asking about F2, which would require another crossing. But in the initial setup, the question mentions \"the F2 generation,\" which might imply the next generation beyond F1. However, in standard genetics terminology, F1 is the first generation, and F2 is the second. But perhaps the user wants the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio. However, the question specifically states \"the F2 generation.\" Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question starts: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, so the question is about the F2 generation, but the initial cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Wait, but usually, F2 comes from F1 x F1. Perhaps the user made a mistake in labeling. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio. Let me read the options again. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with our calculation. However, the options also include others, such as option E, which is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our ratio. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The user wrote: \"for this cross\" implying that this cross is producing the F1, and then the F2 generation refers to the next generation. But perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation. Alternatively, maybe the user is confusing F1 with F2. Let me clarify: The cross described is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). This is a dihybrid cross, resulting in F1 (CcBb). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 generation would be the next generation after F1 x F1. So the question is about the F2 phenotypic ratio. Based on our analysis, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, looking at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, but that doesn't add up to 16. Oh, wait, no\u2014the sum is 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct. But the options list the ratios as checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. According to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. So option C matches that. However, looking back at the original options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nThat seems correct.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo according to our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the problem statement, the question asks for the F2 generation, which includes the phenotypic ratio after F1 selfing. Wait, but I thought F2 refers to the next generation beyond F1, which would be from F1 x F1. However, sometimes F2 refers to the generation after the second mating, but in this context, since the parents are already crossed once, producing F1, and the question is asking about F2, which would require another crossing. But in the initial setup, the question mentions \"the F2 generation,\" which might imply the next generation beyond F1. However, in standard genetics terminology, F1 is the first generation, and F2 is the second. But perhaps the user wants the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio. However, the question specifically states \"the F2 generation.\" Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe question starts: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, so the question is about the F2 generation, but the initial cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Wait, but usually, F2 comes from F1 x F1. Perhaps the user made a mistake in labeling. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio. Let me read the options again. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with our calculation. However, the options also include others, such as option E, which is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our ratio. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The user wrote: \"for this cross\" implying that this cross is producing the F1, and then the F2 generation refers to the next generation. But perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation. Alternatively, maybe the user is confusing F1 with F2. Let me clarify: The cross described is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). This is a dihybrid cross, resulting in F1 (CcBb). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 generation would be the next generation after F1 x F1. So the question is about the F2 phenotypic ratio. Based on our analysis, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, looking at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, but that doesn't add up to 16. Oh, wait, no\u2014the sum is 9+3+3+1=16, which is correct. But the options list the ratios as checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. According to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. So option C matches that. However, looking back at the original options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nThat seems correct. But the question's options are labeled as A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Therefore, the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo all options add up to 16, matching our previous calculation. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. Let's look at option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. According to our calculations, the probabilities are 9:3:3:1, so option C reflects this. Option E also has a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which might correspond to a different arrangement, perhaps if the order is reversed. But looking back, the options may be misaligned in terms of which phenotype corresponds to which ratio. In our case, the order is checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So option C aligns with 9:3:3:1, which is what we derived.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through H, each giving a specific ratio. Option E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That's exactly what we calculated: checkered red (D) = 1 part, checkered brown (B) = 3 parts, plain red (F) = 3 parts, plain brown (C) = 9 parts. So the ratio is 1:3:3:9. But looking at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which aligns with our count. So the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

But looking at the options again, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't align with our earlier conclusion. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine. For each bird:\n\n- C is present (C): red\n- B is present (B): brown\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 respectively. So in terms of counts, for every 16 offspring, there are 9 with red and brown, 3 with red and checkered, 3 with plain and brown, and 1 with plain and checkered. Now, looking at the options, none exactly match 9:3:3:1. However, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't seem right because checkered is represented by the recessive alleles, which would be when both C and B are recessive. Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype comes from both genes being recessive (cc and bb). So in the F2, the checkered phenotype would correspond to the phenotypes where both C and B are recessive, i.e., both are black and plain. Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, resulting in the bird being plain (for the C gene) and plain for the B gene? Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, leading to a plain color and brown body? Wait, no\u2014the checkered color is determined by the B gene, so if both B alleles are recessive (bb), the bird is brown. Wait, no\u2014the B allele determines the color, so brown if B is dominant, checkered if B is recessive. So the checkered phenotype is when B is recessive (bb), regardless of the C gene. Similarly, the plain color is when C is recessive (cc), regardless of B. Therefore, the checkered phenotype is when both C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb). So the checkered phenotype would be when both C and B are recessive, which is 1/16 of the population. Similarly, the checkered brown phenotype would be when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B), which is 3/16. Wait, no\u2014checkered brown is when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B), which is 3/16. Plain red would be when C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b), which is 3/16. Plain brown would be when both C and B are recessive (cc and bb), which is 1/16. So the correct phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That would imply a ratio of 9:3:3:1, but assigning the checkered red to 9 parts instead of 3. That doesn't align with our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the options were scaled differently. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16 parts. This fits our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the labels are swapped. Because in reality, checkered is when both C and B are recessive, which is 1/16. But the option assigns checkered red to 9 parts, which would mean 9/16, checkered brown to 3/16, etc. Hmm, maybe the options are mislabeled. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the presence of dominant alleles rather than recessive. But that wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the phenotype based on the presence of the dominant allele, not the recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele, it expresses the corresponding trait. So if a bird has C (dominant), it's red; if it has B (dominant), it's brown. So the checkered phenotype is when both C and B are recessive, leading to a plain color and brown body. Wait, no\u2014the B allele determines the color. So if a bird is bb (recessive for B), it's brown. But if it's cc (recessive for C), it's plain. So the checkered phenotype is when both C and B are recessive, which is 1/16. Similarly, checkered brown is when C is recessive and B is dominant (3/16). Plain red is when C is dominant and B is recessive (3/16). Plain brown is when both are recessive (1/16). So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but labeled as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which matches option C. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.\n\nWait, according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking at the options again, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't align with our earlier conclusion. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine. For each bird:\n\n- C is present (C): red\n- B is present (B): brown\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 respectively. So in terms of counts, for every 16 offspring, there are 9 with red and brown, 3 with red and checkered, 3 with plain and brown, and 1 with plain and checkered. Now, looking at the options, none exactly match 9:3:3:1. However, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't seem right because checkered is represented by the recessive alleles, which would be when both C and B are recessive. Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype comes from both genes being recessive (cc and bb). So in the F2, the checkered phenotype would correspond to the phenotypes where both C and B are recessive, i.e., both are black and plain. Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, resulting in the bird being plain (for the C gene) and plain for the B gene? Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, leading to a plain color and brown body? Wait, no\u2014the checkered color is determined by the B gene, so if both B alleles are recessive (bb), the bird is brown. Wait, no\u2014the B allele determines the color, so brown if B is dominant, checkered if B is recessive. So the checkered phenotype is when B is recessive (bb), regardless of the C gene. Similarly, the plain color is when C is recessive (cc), regardless of B. Therefore, the checkered phenotype is when both C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb). So the checkered phenotype would be when both C and B are recessive, which is 1/16 of the population. Similarly, the checkered brown phenotype would be when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B), which is 3/16. Wait, no\u2014checkered brown is when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (B), which is 3/16. Plain red would be when C is dominant (C) and B is recessive (b), which is 3/16. Plain brown would be when both C and B are recessive (cc and bb), which is 1/16. So the correct phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That would imply a ratio of 9:3:3:1, but assigning the checkered red to 9 parts instead of 3. That doesn't align with our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the options were scaled differently. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16 parts. This fits our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the labels are swapped. Because in reality, checkered is when both C and B are recessive, which is 1/16. But the option assigns checkered red to 9 parts, which would mean 9/16, checkered brown to 3/16, etc. Hmm, maybe the options are mislabeled. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the presence of dominant alleles rather than recessive. But that wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the phenotype based on the presence of the dominant allele, not the recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele, it expresses the corresponding trait. So if a bird has C (dominant), it's red; if it has B (dominant), it's brown. So the checkered phenotype is when both C and B are recessive, leading to a plain color and brown body. Wait, no\u2014the B allele determines the color. So if a bird is bb (recessive for B), it's brown. But if it's cc (recessive for C), it's plain. So the checkered phenotype is when both C and B are recessive, which is 1/16. Similarly, checkered brown is when C is recessive and B is dominant (3/16). Plain red is when C is dominant and B is recessive (3/16). Plain brown is when both are recessive (1/16). So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but labeled as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which matches option C. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.\n\nIn our calculations, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

So if the total number of offspring is 16, then the ratio is 3:9:1:3. But wait, the original question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, so the answer is that each phenotype corresponds to 3,9,1,3 respectively. But looking at the options, option E is exactly that: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but I thought the correct ratio was 9:3:3:1, but that's for a dihybrid cross without considering dominance. However, in this case, since both traits are determined by dominant alleles, all four phenotypes are present, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But according to our calculation, the proportions are 9,3,3,1, but scaled down. Wait, perhaps the scaling is done based on the actual counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented with the counts relative to the total.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through J, each giving different ratios. Let's look at option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which totals 16. So if the total number of offspring is 16, then the ratio is 3:9:1:3. But wait, the original question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, so the answer is that each phenotype corresponds to 3,9,1,3 respectively. But looking at the options, option E is exactly that: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but I thought the correct ratio was 9:3:3:1, but that's for a dihybrid cross without considering dominance. However, in this case, since both traits are determined by dominant alleles, all four phenotypes are present, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But according to our calculation, the proportions are 9,3,3,1, but scaled down. Wait, perhaps the scaling is done based on the actual counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented with the counts relative to the total. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16.\n\nSo if the total is 16, then the ratio is 3:9:1:3. Which matches our calculations.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A to J, each giving a different count distribution. Our calculation shows that the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This aligns with our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the options provided, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Yes, that fits.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

If each unit represents four birds, then each count is multiplied by four.\n\nSo checkered red would be 3\u00d74=12, but the option states 3. Hmm, perhaps the units represent the total number of birds without scaling. So checkered red would be 3 birds, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16 birds. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3. Which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1. But looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also totals 12, but the ratios are different. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because checkered brown can't be negative. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16. Ratios: 5:3:2:6, which doesn't simplify evenly. Option I says checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. Ratios: 7:5:1:3. Not matching. Option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That totals 16. Ratios: 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. That would mean equal distribution among the four phenotypes. But according to our calculations, the phenotypic ratios are 3:9:1:3. So why do the options suggest something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-examine the probabilities. Each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype A (both traits present):\n- Probability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (which is incorrect because it's certain, which can't be right)\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, but the overall phenotype is a combination of both. Therefore, the correct way to calculate the probability of each phenotype is by considering all possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene and determining if the resulting phenotype is present.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations for the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene (C and B) can have two alleles, so the F2 will have four possible combinations for each gene:\n\n- C/C (pigment red)\n- C/c (pigment red)\n- c/c (plain)\nSimilarly for B:\n- B/B (brown)\n- B/b (brown)\n- b/b (checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, for each bird, if both C and B are present (C/C and B/B), the bird is Phenotype A (red and brown). If C is present but B is recessive (C/C and B/b), then Phenotype B (red and checkered). If B is present but C is recessive (c/c and B/B), Phenotype C (plain and brown). If both are recessive (c/c and b/b), Phenotype D (plain and checkered).\n\nTo find the probability of each phenotype, we need to calculate the probability of each combination leading to that phenotype.\n\nTotal possible combinations: 4 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 12. Wait, no\u2014each gene has three possible phenotypic outcomes, but since each bird has two traits, it's a bit more complex. Alternatively, for each gene, the probability of each trait is:\n\n- Pigment red (C): 3/4 (since any C allele results in red)\n- Pigment plain (c): 1/4\n- Pigment checkered (C recessive): 1/4\n\nSame for body color:\n\n- Brown (B): 3/4\n- Plain (b): 1/4\n\nSince the traits are independent, the combined probability of both traits being present is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nOnly C is present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nOnly B is present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nNeither is present: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- 9 parts: checkered red and brown\n- 3 parts: checkered red and checkered\n- 3 parts: plain red and brown\n- 1 part: plain red and checkered\n\nIf we assume a total of 16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this, but option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's exactly what we've calculated, but with the roles reversed for checkered and plain. So in terms of the answer, the order matters. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options are presented differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counting starts from the lowest frequency. Wait, according to our calculation, the highest frequency is checkered red and brown (9), followed by checkered red and checkered (3), plain red and brown (3), and plain red and checkered (1). But none of the options match this exact order. Instead, option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's exactly the inverse of what we have, but the ratios themselves remain the same\u20149:3:3:1. So the correct answer would correspond to this ratio. However, the options don't have this exact phrasing. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That fits our calculated ratio of 9:3:3:1, but with the checkered-red and checkered-brown swapped. Since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, it's important to match the order as specified. Our analysis shows that the highest frequency is checkered-red and brown, then checkered-red and checkered, then plain-red and brown, then plain-red and checkered. However, option E presents the reverse order for the first two phenotypes, but the rest follow appropriately. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the ratio in the order of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our calculation, that's 9:3:3:1, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. None of the options seem to match exactly. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the probabilities. Let me try a different approach. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of alleles.\n\nFor phenotype A (red and brown):\n\n- Must have at least one C (pigment red)\n- Must have at least one B (body brown)\nThus, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype B (red and checkered):\n\n- Must have at least one C (pigment red)\n- Must not have at least one B (body checkered)\nThus, the probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype C (plain and brown):\n\n- Must not have at least one C (pigment plain)\n- Must have at least one B (body brown)\nThus, the probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (plain and checkered):\n\n- Must not have at least one C (pigment plain)\n- Must not have at least one B (body checkered)\nThus, the probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. If we assume a sample size of 16, the counts would be 9, 3, 3, 1. However, the options are giving counts in a different order. Option E provides checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of our calculated ratio. None of the options perfectly match this unless the order is considered.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the question expects the order to reflect the presence of the traits in a certain sequence. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the ratio to be ordered by the number of dominant traits. But in reality, the order in the options should match the phenotypic classification as per the question.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the ratio being inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me confirm:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain red: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain brown: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one that reflects this ratio, regardless of the ordering. Among the options, option E reflects the same relative proportions but in the opposite order. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the order of appearance in the classification, so checkered red comes before checkered brown, etc. But in our case, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not listed exactly. The closest option is E, which is 3:9:1:3, but that's the inverse. Perhaps the question intended the ratio to be expressed in descending order of phenotype complexity, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A (checkered red): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (checkered brown): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (plain red): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (plain brown): 1/16\n\nExpressed as a ratio, ignoring the denominator, it's 9:3:3:1. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. However, looking at the options again, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me verify once more.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the order of the letters. The options may have the order switched. Let me read the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled from A to J, and the task is to choose the correct one. From the analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. However, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be written in the order of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which would indeed be 9:3:3:1, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be simplified or expressed differently.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is the only one that lists the checkered-red and checkered-brown together, followed by plain-red and plain-brown, which aligns with the inverse ratio. So despite the discrepancy in order, option E is the closest match, possibly due to a misunderstanding in the question's presentation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. So perhaps each unit represents four birds. Because 3 + 9 + 1 + 3 =16 units, each representing four birds. So each unit corresponds to 4 birds. Therefore, Phenotype A (both traits red and brown): 3 units \u2192 3\u00d74=12 birds\nPhenotype B (only red): 9 units \u2192 9\u00d74=36 birds\nPhenotype C (only brown): 1\u00d74=4 birds\nPhenotype D (neither): 3\u00d74=12 birds\nWait, but that doesn't align with the options given. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16. If each unit represents four birds, then each count is multiplied by four.\n\nSo checkered red would be 3\u00d74=12, but the option states 3. Hmm, perhaps the units represent the total number of birds without scaling. So checkered red would be 3 birds, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16 birds. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3. Which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1. But looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also totals 12, but the ratios are different. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't make sense because checkered brown can't be negative. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16. Ratios: 5:3:2:6, which doesn't simplify evenly. Option I says checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. Ratios: 7:5:1:3. Not matching. Option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That totals 16. Ratios: 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. That would mean equal distribution among the four phenotypes. But according to our calculations, the phenotypic ratios are 3:9:1:3. So why do the options suggest something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-examine the probabilities. Each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). The presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype A (both traits present):\n- Probability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (which is incorrect because it's certain, which can't be right)\n\nWait, no\u2014this is incorrect because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, but the overall phenotype is a combination of both. Therefore, the correct way to calculate the probability of each phenotype is by considering all possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene and determining if the resulting phenotype is present.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations for the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene (C and B) can have two alleles, so the F2 will have four possible combinations for each gene:\n\n- C/C (pigment red)\n- C/c (pigment red)\n- c/c (plain)\nSimilarly for B:\n- B/B (brown)\n- B/b (brown)\n- b/b (checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, for each bird, if both C and B are present (C/C and B/B), the bird is Phenotype A (red and brown). If C is present but B is recessive (C/C and B/b), then Phenotype B (red and checkered). If B is present but C is recessive (c/c and B/B), Phenotype C (plain and brown). If both are recessive (c/c and b/b), Phenotype D (plain and checkered).\n\nTo find the probability of each phenotype, we need to calculate the probability of each combination leading to that phenotype.\n\nTotal possible combinations: 4 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 12. Wait, no\u2014each gene has three possible phenotypic outcomes, but since each bird has two traits, it's a bit more complex. Alternatively, for each gene, the probability of each trait is:\n\n- Pigment red (C): 3/4 (since any C allele results in red)\n- Pigment plain (c): 1/4\n- Pigment checkered (C recessive): 1/4\n\nSame for body color:\n\n- Brown (B): 3/4\n- Plain (b): 1/4\n\nSince the traits are independent, the combined probability of both traits being present is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nOnly C is present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nOnly B is present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nNeither is present: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- 9 parts: checkered red and brown\n- 3 parts: checkered red and checkered\n- 3 parts: plain red and brown\n- 1 part: plain red and checkered\n\nIf we assume a total of 16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this, but option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's exactly what we've calculated, but with the roles reversed for checkered and plain. So in terms of the answer, the order matters. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options are presented differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counting starts from the lowest frequency. Wait, according to our calculation, the highest frequency is checkered red and brown (9), followed by checkered red and checkered (3), plain red and brown (3), and plain red and checkered (1). But none of the options match this exact order. Instead, option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's exactly the inverse of what we have, but the ratios themselves remain the same\u20149:3:3:1. So the correct answer would correspond to this ratio. However, the options don't have this exact phrasing. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That fits our calculated ratio of 9:3:3:1, but with the checkered-red and checkered-brown swapped. Since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, it's important to match the order as specified. Our analysis shows that the highest frequency is checkered-red and brown, then checkered-red and checkered, then plain-red and brown, then plain-red and checkered. However, option E presents the reverse order for the first two phenotypes, but the rest follow appropriately. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects the ratio in the order of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our calculation, that's 9:3:3:1, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. None of the options seem to match exactly. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the probabilities. Let me try a different approach. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of alleles.\n\nFor phenotype A (red and brown):\n\n- Must have at least one C (pigment red)\n- Must have at least one B (body brown)\nThus, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype B (red and checkered):\n\n- Must have at least one C (pigment red)\n- Must not have at least one B (body checkered)\nThus, the probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype C (plain and brown):\n\n- Must not have at least one C (pigment plain)\n- Must have at least one B (body brown)\nThus, the probability is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (plain and checkered):\n\n- Must not have at least one C (pigment plain)\n- Must not have at least one B (body checkered)\nThus, the probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. If we assume a sample size of 16, the counts would be 9, 3, 3, 1. However, the options are giving counts in a different order. Option E provides checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of our calculated ratio. None of the options perfectly match this unless the order is considered.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the question expects the order to reflect the presence of the traits in a certain sequence. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the ratio to be ordered by the number of dominant traits. But in reality, the order in the options should match the phenotypic classification as per the question.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the ratio being inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me confirm:\n\n- Checkered red: Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain red: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain brown: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one that reflects this ratio, regardless of the ordering. Among the options, option E reflects the same relative proportions but in the opposite order. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the order of appearance in the classification, so checkered red comes before checkered brown, etc. But in our case, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not listed exactly. The closest option is E, which is 3:9:1:3, but that's the inverse. Perhaps the question intended the ratio to be expressed in descending order of phenotype complexity, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A (checkered red): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (checkered brown): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (plain red): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (plain brown): 1/16\n\nExpressed as a ratio, ignoring the denominator, it's 9:3:3:1. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. However, looking at the options again, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me verify once more.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the order of the letters. The options may have the order switched. Let me read the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled from A to J, and the task is to choose the correct one. From the analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. However, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be written in the order of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which would indeed be 9:3:3:1, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be simplified or expressed differently.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is the only one that lists the checkered-red and checkered-brown together, followed by plain-red and plain-brown, which aligns with the inverse ratio. So despite the discrepancy in order, option E is the closest match, possibly due to a misunderstanding in the question's presentation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, adding up the denominators: \nA: 6+2+6+2=16\nB: 8+4+0+4=16\nC: 9+3+3+1=16\nD: 1+3+9+3=16\nE: 3+9+1+3=16\n\nSo all options sum to 16. But according to our calculations, the distribution should be 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this. Wait, but looking closer:\n\nOur calculations gave: \n- Phenotype A: 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: 1 part\n\nLooking at the options, option C has 9,3,3,1, which matches. Option C lists the phenotypes as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that fits our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to the probabilities we've calculated (1/16, 3/16, 3/16, 9/16). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. Which is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through H, each giving a different ratio. Let me look at option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That corresponds to 1 part checkered red, 3 plain red, 9 checkered brown, 3 plain brown. Which aligns with the 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is the standard Mendelian ratio for two linked genes. So that fits with our calculations.\n\nNow, looking at the F2 phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A: checkered red (1 part)\n- Phenotype B: checkered brown (3 parts)\n- Phenotype C: plain red (9 parts)\n- Phenotype D: plain brown (3 parts)\n\nSo the ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 9 : 3. This corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through J, each giving a certain count for each phenotype. Let me look at option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" That adds up to 16, matching our expectation. So option E seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Wait, but wait\u2014is that correct? Because in our analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the expected counts would be:\n\nTotal = 16 parts.\n\nIf each part represents a certain number of birds, say N, then:\n\nCheckered red: 9N\n\nCheckered brown: 3N\n\nPlain red: 3N\n\nPlain brown: N\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to fit exactly unless we assume that the scale factor is such that the smallest group is 1. Option C says 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. However, looking at the options again, option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". This aligns with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the answer should be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo each option represents the count for each phenotype. According to our calculations, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, 3 parts plain red, and 1 part plain brown. Looking at the options, option C matches exactly with 9,3,3,1. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Total 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo according to our calculations, option C is the correct ratio, as it matches the 9,3,3,1 distribution. Wait, but looking back, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So in the F2 generation, the number of birds in each phenotype would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 of the birds\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a sample size of 16 birds, we'd have 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D. This corresponds exactly to option C. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through H, each giving a different ratio. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That aligns with the 3:3:1:1 ratio, but scaled by 1/16. Wait, no\u2014if the ratio is 3:3:1:1, that's a 16:1 ratio, which would mean 3 out of 16 have one trait, etc. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which is exactly 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not matching our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, no\u2014my earlier breakdown was 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A:B:C:D as 9:3:3:1, i.e., 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. But in the options, none seem to match that. Let me look again at the options:\n\nLooking back:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 = 3:1:3:1\n\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 = 2:1:0:1\n\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 which fits our analysis\n\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3 \u2192 which is a perfect square, but our analysis shows 9:3:3:1, so D is incorrect.\n\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not matching our 9:3:3:1.\n\nSo the correct ratio according to our analysis is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A to H, each giving a different ratio. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This corresponds exactly to our calculation: 3:9:1:3. So the answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A through J, with various ratios. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to 3,9,1,3. But according to our calculations, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypic distribution would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But looking at the options:\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nSo option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A-D are specific ratios, while E is also a ratio but scaled differently. Let me look at option E: \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\" This corresponds to Phenotype D: 1 part, Phenotype B: 3 parts, Phenotype C: 3 parts, Phenotype A: 9 parts. But according to our calculations, Phenotype A is 9/16, Phenotype B is 3/16, C is 3/16, D is 1/16. But none of the answer choices seem to have denominators adding up to 16. Instead, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Total 16.\n\nSo if we assume that the F2 population consists of 16 birds, the counts would be: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which aligns with our probabilities (assuming N is a multiple of 16). Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,0,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3. Hmm, according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. Wait, but looking back, the options list C as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. Checkered red 6, ... ; E. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nSo according to our calculations, the counts should be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking at the options, E matches this exactly. So the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Total 16. B. 8,4,0,4. Total 16. C. 9,3,3,1. Total 16. D. 1,3,9,3. Total 16. E. 3,9,1,3. Total 16. All options add up to 16. So now, looking back at the probabilities, the distribution was 9,3,3,1. Which corresponds exactly to option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our analysis, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. But looking at the answer choices, option C states \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.",
    "rollout": " A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.\n\nSo according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back, in the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, that's 9:3:3:1, which is exactly what we derived. But in the options, option E is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which also sums to 16, but the order is reversed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me double-check: For a bird to be checkered red, does that mean it's C (plain) and B (brown)? Yes. Checkered brown would be C (plain) and B (brown). Plain red is c (plain) and B (brown). Plain brown is c (plain) and b (checkered). Wait, that's different from what I thought before. Wait, no, the letters are confusing. Let me clarify: The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered red: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Checkered brown: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Plain red: cc (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain brown: cc (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nWait, that changes things! So the correct phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (D): c (plain) and B (brown)\n2. Checkered brown (D): Same as above\n3. Plain red (C): cc (plain) and B (brown)\n4. Plain brown (B): cc (plain) and b (checkered)\n\nNow, recalculating the probabilities:\n\nFor each bird, the chance of checking out each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype D (checkered brown): c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 (1/4)* (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (plain red): cc (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Phenotype D (same as above)\n- Phenotype B (plain brown): cc (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because if a bird is c (plain) and B (brown), it's D. If it's c and b, it's B. If it's cc and B, it's C. If it's cc and b, it's B. So the probabilities are:\n\n- D: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- B: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n- C: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nWait, that still sums to 3+1+3=7 over 16, but that's inconsistent with the previous approach. Perhaps I need to re-examine the calculation. Let me try a different method: Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is inherited independently, so the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nEach combination of these gives a bird. Now, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (either C C, C c, or c C), and B is present (B B, B b, or b B), then the bird is Phenotype A: checkered red and brown.\n- If C is present, but B is not (only bb), then Phenotype B: checkered red and plain.\n- If C is not present (cc), but B is present (B B, B b, or b B), then Phenotype C: plain red and brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (cc bb), then Phenotype D: plain red and plain brown.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A (Checkered red and brown): This happens when at least one C is present AND at least one B is present. The probability of at least one C is 3/4, and the probability of at least one B is 3/4. Assuming independence, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype B (Checkered red and plain): This happens when C is present (3/4) and B is not (1/4). So probability is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype C (Plain red and brown): This happens when C is not present (1/4) and B is present (3/4). Probability is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (Plain red and plain brown): This happens when both C and B are not present, i.e., cc and bb. Probability is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which accounts for all possibilities. So now, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options provided, option C states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns perfectly with our calculation. Option E, however, swaps the checkered and plain colors, making it incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3.\n\nSo according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back, in the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, that's 9:3:3:1, which is exactly what we derived. But in the options, option E is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which also sums to 16, but the order is reversed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me double-check: For a bird to be checkered red, does that mean it's C (plain) and B (brown)? Yes. Checkered brown would be C (plain) and B (brown). Plain red is c (plain) and B (brown). Plain brown is c (plain) and b (checkered). Wait, that's different from what I thought before. Wait, no, the letters are confusing. Let me clarify: The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Checkered red: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Checkered brown: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Plain red: cc (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain brown: cc (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nWait, that changes things! So the correct phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (D): c (plain) and B (brown)\n2. Checkered brown (D): Same as above\n3. Plain red (C): cc (plain) and B (brown)\n4. Plain brown (B): cc (plain) and b (checkered)\n\nNow, recalculating the probabilities:\n\nFor each bird, the chance of checking out each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype D (checkered brown): c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 (1/4)* (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (plain red): cc (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Phenotype D (same as above)\n- Phenotype B (plain brown): cc (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because if a bird is c (plain) and B (brown), it's D. If it's c and b, it's B. If it's cc and B, it's C. If it's cc and b, it's B. So the probabilities are:\n\n- D: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- B: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n- C: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nWait, that still sums to 3+1+3=7 over 16, but that's inconsistent with the previous approach. Perhaps I need to re-examine the calculation. Let me try a different method: Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is inherited independently, so the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- For the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nEach combination of these gives a bird. Now, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (either C C, C c, or c C), and B is present (B B, B b, or b B), then the bird is Phenotype A: checkered red and brown.\n- If C is present, but B is not (only bb), then Phenotype B: checkered red and plain.\n- If C is not present (cc), but B is present (B B, B b, or b B), then Phenotype C: plain red and brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (cc bb), then Phenotype D: plain red and plain brown.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A (Checkered red and brown): This happens when at least one C is present AND at least one B is present. The probability of at least one C is 3/4, and the probability of at least one B is 3/4. Assuming independence, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype B (Checkered red and plain): This happens when C is present (3/4) and B is not (1/4). So probability is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype C (Plain red and brown): This happens when C is not present (1/4) and B is present (3/4). Probability is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nPhenotype D (Plain red and plain brown): This happens when both C and B are not present, i.e., cc and bb. Probability is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which accounts for all possibilities. So now, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options provided, option C states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns perfectly with our calculation. Option E, however, swaps the checkered and plain colors, making it incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

But looking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which is exactly the same as 9:3:3:1 scaled by a factor of 1/4, perhaps. Wait, no\u2014the 9:3:3:1 already accounts for the probabilities. So perhaps the answer is E, which states the exact probabilities. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check: For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, and B present is also 3/4. Since the two are independent, the combined probability is 9/16. So Phenotype A is 9/16, B is 3/16, C is 3/16, D is 1/16. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, matching option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class.

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "rollout": " E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16, which corresponds to 9+3+3+1=16. So the proportionate ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which matches exactly. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Wait, but according to our analysis, checkered red would correspond to the cases where both C and B are present, which is 9 parts, and checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1. So the correct order is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none have this exact ratio. Wait, let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThis aligns with our calculation: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Hmm, according to our calculations, the numbers should be 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to option C. Wait, but I thought I had 9,3,3,1. Let me double-check: For a bird, the chance of having both traits is 9/16, only C is 3/16, only B is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. So if there are, say, 16 birds, 9 would have both, 3 would have only C, 3 would have only B, and 1 would have neither. So the ratios would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse order. Wait, but the options are labeled with checkered red first, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red (C) 9, plain red (D) 3, checkered brown (B) 3, plain brown (C) 1. So looking back at the options, option C states \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "rollout": " E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to Phenotype A:B:C:D as 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 that's 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That would correspond to 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what we calculated. Hmm, did I mix up the order?\n\nWait, the options are labeled with the order: A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nThen E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo, our calculation was 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 9:3:3:1. But option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. That suggests I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. Perhaps I confused the order of the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio is presented differently. Wait, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is listed as (checkered red):(checkered brown):(plain red):(plain brown), which is 9:3:3:1. But option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which is 3:9, which is 1:3 ratio, whereas our calculation shows 9:3. So perhaps I swapped something. Alternatively, maybe the order is different. Let me check again. If the order is checkered red first, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which would imply a ratio of 1:3 instead of 9:3. That suggests a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is segregating independently. So for the C locus, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Similarly for the B locus. So the F2 would have a 3x3 grid for each gene, leading to nine possible combinations. Each combination represents a possible phenotype. The phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present. So the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | B | bb |\n        -----------------\n        | CB | CB |\n        | cb | cb |\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n        | C | cc |\n        -------------------\n        | CB | cb |\n\nSimilarly for the B locus. Now, constructing the Punnett square for both genes together, resulting in four phenotypes. Each combination of C and B will determine the phenotype. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red (since C and B are recessive for red and brown respectively)\nWait, no\u2014wait, in reality, C is dominant for red, so any C allele makes the bird red. B is dominant for brown, so any B allele makes the bird brown. So a bird with both C and B alleles will have both traits: red and brown. Similarly, a bird with C but not B will have red but checkered. A bird with B but not C will have checkered but brown. A bird with neither will have plain and checkered. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (let's call this Phenotype A)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Phenotype B)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (Phenotype C)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nNow, to find the probabilities for each phenotype, we can use the fact that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. The probability of each phenotype can be calculated by determining the fraction of F2 individuals that fall into each category. \n\nThe F2 population consists of 16 possible combinations of alleles, but grouped into four phenotypes. The number of individuals for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each possible genotype combination:\n\n- 16 individuals total.\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 This occurs when both parents contribute C and B. The number of such combinations is (number of ways to get C and B from each parent). Each parent has a 50% chance to contribute C or B. So the number of Phenotype A individuals is 1 (from CB) * 1 (from CB) = 1 combination, but scaled by the total number of individuals. Wait, perhaps a better way is to recognize that for each gene, the number of Phenotype A individuals is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 of the total. Similarly, Phenotype B is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, Phenotype C is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, and Phenotype D is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Adding these up gives 9+3+3+1=16, which fits. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for Phenotype A:B:C:D.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none directly state this ratio. The closest option is E, which presents the ratio as 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me reread the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options are A through J, each giving a different ratio. According to our analysis, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 9:3:3:1. However, looking at option E, the ratio is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would mean a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. But our analysis showed 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to checkered red being the most common. None of the options match exactly. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio in terms of the presence of the dominant traits, not the recessive ones. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the order of the phenotypes in the ratio. Let me look at the options again.\n\nLooking at option E: 3:9:1:3. This would correspond to checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 3:9:1:3. That doesn't align with our calculation of 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is ordered differently. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio in terms of the presence of the recessive traits, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the correct ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the presence of the recessive traits as the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the recessives. So the correct ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, but since none of the options match 9:3:3:1, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me go back.\n\nWait, another possibility: the question may be referring to the ratio of the number of birds with checkered vs. plain, and brown vs. red. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's a ratio of 3:9:1:3. Wait, perhaps this is referring to the count of each phenotype relative to the others, but it's still unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each type of bird, regardless of the phenotype, but that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic expression without accounting for dominance, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming a large population, say 16 birds (to avoid fractions):\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): 9 birds\n- Phenotype B (C only): 3 birds\n- Phenotype C (B only): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (none): 1 bird\n\nTotal: 16 birds. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options:\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3:9:1:3. Not matching.\n\nAnother option is G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0.\n\nH: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. 5:3:2:6.\n\nI: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. 7:5:1:3.\n\nJ: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. 2:6:3:1.\n\nNone of these options match 9:3:3:1. But perhaps the question is phrased differently, and the ratio refers to the presence of the recessive traits. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of birds with each phenotype versus those without, but that would change the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is missing some details.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, maybe I got the parents wrong. The problem says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" (CC BB) and \"a plain brown bird\" (cc bb). So when crossed, their F1 would be CcBb, as previously thought. Then F1 x F1 would yield the F2 generation. So the previous analysis holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. But perhaps the question expects the ratio to be simplified in terms of dominant vs. recessive traits. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratio in terms of the presence of the dominant traits, ignoring the recessive ones, but that's not standard practice. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different definition of phenotypes, such as considering only the presence of at least one dominant allele, which would include all four phenotypes, but that's what we already did.\n\nGiven that, and since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is option E, but it's reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of checkered to plain and red to brown, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with each phenotype compared to the others, but that doesn't affect the ratio itself. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly formulated.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the calculations, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since this isn't an option, I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but that doesn't align with the calculations. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, I'll select the closest option, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me recount with N=16:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this. However, option E states 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't add up to 16. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't add up. Option I is 7:5:1:3, and option J is 2:6:3:1. None match 9:3:3:1.\n\nPerhaps the question is expecting the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype relative to the others, but that would require dividing each by the total, which doesn't change the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of the recessive alleles as the phenotype, but that's not how it works. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the traits, thinking that checkered is the dominant trait and plain is recessive, but that's not the case.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects the dominance hierarchy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, despite the ratio being inverted, but I'm not confident.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I think the correct answer is option E, but I acknowledge that the ratio is inverted. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the ratio of checkered to plain, and red to brown, but the options don't reflect that. Without further clarification, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since this isn't an option, I might have made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which is the checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), and plain brown (1). Comparing this to the options, none match exactly. However, option E presents the ratio as checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. This suggests a possible misunderstanding in the question's framing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype in a different context, such as comparing checkered to plain and red to brown, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but I'm uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations, but I've double-checked them multiple times. Given that, I'll proceed with selecting the option that most closely resembles the ratio, although it's not exact.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{E}\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to Phenotype A:B:C:D as 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2013 that's 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That would correspond to 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what we calculated. Hmm, did I mix up the order?\n\nWait, the options are labeled with the order: A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nThen E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo, our calculation was 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 9:3:3:1. But option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. That suggests I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. Perhaps I confused the order of the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio is presented differently. Wait, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is listed as (checkered red):(checkered brown):(plain red):(plain brown), which is 9:3:3:1. But option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which is 3:9, which is 1:3 ratio, whereas our calculation shows 9:3. So perhaps I swapped something. Alternatively, maybe the order is different. Let me check again. If the order is checkered red first, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, which would imply a ratio of 1:3 instead of 9:3. That suggests a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is segregating independently. So for the C locus, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Similarly for the B locus. So the F2 would have a 3x3 grid for each gene, leading to nine possible combinations. Each combination represents a possible phenotype. The phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present. So the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | B | bb |\n        -----------------\n        | CB | CB |\n        | cb | cb |\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n        | C | cc |\n        -------------------\n        | CB | cb |\n\nSimilarly for the B locus. Now, constructing the Punnett square for both genes together, resulting in four phenotypes. Each combination of C and B will determine the phenotype. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red (since C and B are recessive for red and brown respectively)\nWait, no\u2014wait, in reality, C is dominant for red, so any C allele makes the bird red. B is dominant for brown, so any B allele makes the bird brown. So a bird with both C and B alleles will have both traits: red and brown. Similarly, a bird with C but not B will have red but checkered. A bird with B but not C will have checkered but brown. A bird with neither will have plain and checkered. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (let's call this Phenotype A)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Phenotype B)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (Phenotype C)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nNow, to find the probabilities for each phenotype, we can use the fact that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. The probability of each phenotype can be calculated by determining the fraction of F2 individuals that fall into each category. \n\nThe F2 population consists of 16 possible combinations of alleles, but grouped into four phenotypes. The number of individuals for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each possible genotype combination:\n\n- 16 individuals total.\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 This occurs when both parents contribute C and B. The number of such combinations is (number of ways to get C and B from each parent). Each parent has a 50% chance to contribute C or B. So the number of Phenotype A individuals is 1 (from CB) * 1 (from CB) = 1 combination, but scaled by the total number of individuals. Wait, perhaps a better way is to recognize that for each gene, the number of Phenotype A individuals is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 of the total. Similarly, Phenotype B is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, Phenotype C is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, and Phenotype D is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Adding these up gives 9+3+3+1=16, which fits. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for Phenotype A:B:C:D.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none directly state this ratio. The closest option is E, which presents the ratio as 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me reread the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options are A through J, each giving a different ratio. According to our analysis, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 9:3:3:1. However, looking at option E, the ratio is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would mean a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. But our analysis showed 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to checkered red being the most common. None of the options match exactly. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio in terms of the presence of the dominant traits, not the recessive ones. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the order of the phenotypes in the ratio. Let me look at the options again.\n\nLooking at option E: 3:9:1:3. This would correspond to checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 3:9:1:3. That doesn't align with our calculation of 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is ordered differently. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio in terms of the presence of the recessive traits, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the correct ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the presence of the recessive traits as the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the recessives. So the correct ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, but since none of the options match 9:3:3:1, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me go back.\n\nWait, another possibility: the question may be referring to the ratio of the number of birds with checkered vs. plain, and brown vs. red. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's a ratio of 3:9:1:3. Wait, perhaps this is referring to the count of each phenotype relative to the others, but it's still unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each type of bird, regardless of the phenotype, but that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic expression without accounting for dominance, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming a large population, say 16 birds (to avoid fractions):\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): 9 birds\n- Phenotype B (C only): 3 birds\n- Phenotype C (B only): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (none): 1 bird\n\nTotal: 16 birds. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options:\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3:9:1:3. Not matching.\n\nAnother option is G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0.\n\nH: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. 5:3:2:6.\n\nI: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. 7:5:1:3.\n\nJ: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. 2:6:3:1.\n\nNone of these options match 9:3:3:1. But perhaps the question is phrased differently, and the ratio refers to the presence of the recessive traits. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of birds with each phenotype versus those without, but that would change the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is missing some details.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nWait, maybe I got the parents wrong. The problem says: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" (CC BB) and \"a plain brown bird\" (cc bb). So when crossed, their F1 would be CcBb, as previously thought. Then F1 x F1 would yield the F2 generation. So the previous analysis holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. But perhaps the question expects the ratio to be simplified in terms of dominant vs. recessive traits. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the phenotypic ratio in terms of the presence of the dominant traits, ignoring the recessive ones, but that's not standard practice. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different definition of phenotypes, such as considering only the presence of at least one dominant allele, which would include all four phenotypes, but that's what we already did.\n\nGiven that, and since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is option E, but it's reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of checkered to plain and red to brown, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with each phenotype compared to the others, but that doesn't affect the ratio itself. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly formulated.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the calculations, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since this isn't an option, I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but that doesn't align with the calculations. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since I have to choose, I'll select the closest option, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me recount with N=16:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this. However, option E states 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't add up to 16. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which also doesn't add up. Option I is 7:5:1:3, and option J is 2:6:3:1. None match 9:3:3:1.\n\nPerhaps the question is expecting the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype relative to the others, but that would require dividing each by the total, which doesn't change the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of the recessive alleles as the phenotype, but that's not how it works. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the traits, thinking that checkered is the dominant trait and plain is recessive, but that's not the case.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects the dominance hierarchy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, despite the ratio being inverted, but I'm not confident.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I think the correct answer is option E, but I acknowledge that the ratio is inverted. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the ratio of checkered to plain, and red to brown, but the options don't reflect that. Without further clarification, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since this isn't an option, I might have made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which is the checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), and plain brown (1). Comparing this to the options, none match exactly. However, option E presents the ratio as checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown = 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. This suggests a possible misunderstanding in the question's framing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype in a different context, such as comparing checkered to plain and red to brown, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but I'm uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations, but I've double-checked them multiple times. Given that, I'll proceed with selecting the option that most closely resembles the ratio, although it's not exact.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{E}\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to our 1:3:3:1 ratio.

However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A. Checkered red 6, ...",
    "rollout": " A. Checkered red 6, ... etc. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the ratio without normalization. Let me try a different approach. Instead of dividing into parts, let's look at the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on their alleles for each gene. The possible genotypic combinations are:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (dominant, red)\n- Cc (recessive, plain)\n- cc (dominant, plain)\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\n- BB (dominant, brown)\n- Bb (recessive, checkered)\n- bb (dominant, checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red brown?\nNo, wait, correct phenotypic expression is: \n- Pigment red: C is present\n- Brown: B is present\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these. Similarly,\n- Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent\n- Plain red and brown: C absent, B present\n- Plain red and checkered: C absent, B absent\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet me list the possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C present, B present) \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Wait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, which isn't the case. Clearly, I've misunderstood something.\n\nAh! Wait a minute. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. So, for example, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown, regardless of C. Therefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes together, but each gene's effect is independent. So the combined phenotype is determined by both traits simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratios is by considering the combined presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's create a table of all possible combinations and count how many have each phenotype.\n\nPossible Genotypic Combinations (for each gene):\n\nGene C:\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (plain)\n- cc (plain)\n\nGene B:\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (checkered)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nCombined Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red-checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red-brown): Cases 1,4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype 2 (Red-checkered): Cases 2,3,5,6 \u2192 4 cases\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown): Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain-checkered): Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nAssuming a large sample size, the ratio would be 2:4:2:1, which simplifies to 1:2:1:0.5, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it becomes 2:4:2:1. Now, looking at the answer options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This corresponds to Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown) : Phenotype 1 (Red-brown) : Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown) : Phenotype 1 (Red-brown) \u2192 2:2:1:1, scaled up by a factor of 3 to get 6:6:3:3, but that doesn't match exactly. Option A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option B: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This fits our count perfectly: 2+6=8? Wait, no. Our count was 2 cases for Red-brown, 4 for Red-checkered, 2 for Plain-brown, and 1 for Plain-checkered. So total is 9 birds. So scaling up by 3, we'd have 6 Red-brown, 12 Red-checkered, 6 Plain-brown, and 3 Plain-checkered. But the options don't have such high numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is different. Wait, perhaps each bird is considered individually, so the counts are as follows: \n\nIn F2, each parent is CcBb. The F2 will have 9 birds. Each bird's phenotype is determined by their combination. So:\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Red-brown \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 2: Red-checkered \u2192 4 birds\n- Phenotype 3: Plain-brown \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 4: Plain-checkered \u2192 1 bird\n\nTotal: 9 birds. The ratios are 2:4:2:1. To express this as a fraction of the total population, each phenotype's frequency is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 2/9\n- Phenotype 2: 4/9\n- Phenotype 3: 2/9\n- Phenotype 4: 1/9\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match this exact ratio, but option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would correspond to Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown) : Phenotype 1 (Red-brown) : Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown) : Phenotype 1 (Red-brown) \u2192 2:2:1:1, which is 6:6:3:3 when scaled up by 3. But the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is applied incorrectly. Another possibility is that the problem assumes a different approach, such as considering the percentage of each phenotype relative to each other without considering the entire population. But that complicates things further.\n\nGiven the available options, option E seems to have the correct ratios for checkered red and checkered brown, which are Phenotypes 1 and 3, respectively. Specifically, it states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Based on our analysis, checkered red (Phenotype 1) should be 2, checkered brown (Phenotype 3) should be 2, but option E has 3 and 9, which doesn't align. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check the probabilities.\n\nAnother approach: Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Gene C:\n\nPhenotype of pigment color (red or plain):\n- Red: probability = 1 - (probability of cc)\nSince the F1 is Cc, the probability of cc is 25%, so 75% chance of red.\n\n- Plain: 25%\n\nFor Gene B:\n\nPhenotype of body color (brown or checkered):\n- Brown: probability = 1 - (probability of bb)\nF1 is Bb, so probability of bb is 25%, thus 75% brown.\n\n- Checkered: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic probabilities are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nThus, the combined phenotypic probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits present: 0.75 (C) * 0.75 (B) = 0.5625 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Only C present: 0.75 (C) * 0.25 (not B) = 0.1875 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Only B present: 0.25 (not C) * 0.75 (B) = 0.1875 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Neither trait present: 0.25 (not C) * 0.25 (not B) = 0.0625 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThese add up to 1, confirming the calculations.\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into actual counts assuming a large population, say 16 birds (to avoid fractions), but since the options have higher numbers, perhaps we scale appropriately. However, the options don't provide 16 as a denominator. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratios without normalization, focusing solely on the proportionate distribution among the phenotypes.\n\nIn that case, the ratios would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 3/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nWhich doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers each bird's phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, leading to four phenotypes, each with a certain frequency.\n\nIf we take the ratios as 2:4:2:1, which sum to 9, the proportions are 2/9, 4/9, 2/9, 1/9. But the options don't reflect this exactly. Looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would suggest a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which totals 16. That doesn't match our 2:4:2:1. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant for pigment, and c is recessive. Wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, perhaps the presence of dominant allele C results in red, and recessive c results in plain. So, the dominant allele for color (C) is responsible for the color change from plain to red, while the recessive allele (c) is responsible for the color being plain.\n\nWait, that changes things. Earlier, I assumed that C was dominant for pigment, but according to this, perhaps C is the dominant allele for color, making it red, and c is the recessive allele for plain. So, the presence of at least one C allele results in red pigment, and the absence results in plain. Similarly, for the body color, B is the dominant allele for brown, and b is recessive for checkered. So, the presence of at least one B allele results in brown, and the absence results in checkered.\n\nThis changes the analysis because now, the presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype. So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both color and body. Let me redefine the phenotypes based on this understanding.\n\nPhenotype definitions:\n\n- Pigment red (C present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red-brown\n- Pigment red (C present) and body checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c present) and body checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain-checkered\n\nNow, let's recalculate the probabilities.\n\nFor Pigment color (C/B):\n- Presence of C (C_: 3/4) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Absence of C (cc: 1/4) \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor Body color (B/b):\n- Presence of B (BB or Bb: 3/4) \u2192 Body brown\n- Absence of B (bb: 1/4) \u2192 Body checkered\n\nSince these are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and Body brown (B_: 3/4) \u2192 Phenotype 1: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C_) and Body checkered (bb: 1/4) \u2192 Phenotype 2: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n3. Pigment plain (cc) and Body brown (B_: 3/4) \u2192 Phenotype 3: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n4. Pigment plain (cc) and Body checkered (bb: 1/4) \u2192 Phenotype 4: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out. Now, mapping these probabilities to the answer choices.\n\nThe phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nExpressed as a ratio, this is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer options, none seem to match this exactly. However, let's compare with the options:\n\nOption A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 6:6:2:2 \u2192 Ratios simplify to 3:3:1:1\n\nOption B: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Simplified to 3:1:3:1\n\nOption C: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Same as B\n\nOption D: 6,1,3,1 \u2192 6:1:3:1\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nOur calculated ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype 1:9, Phenotype 2:3, Phenotype 3:3, Phenotype 4:1. None of the options exactly match this, but let's see if any of them approximate this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to the others, without normalizing to 16. For example, the ratio could be expressed as 9:3:3:1, which would mean Phenotype 1 is 9 units, Phenotype 2 is 3 units, etc. But the answer options don't have this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and instead count the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles regardless of order, treating each as a separate trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem initially. Let me read it again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color by the recessive allele c. Checkered color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. It seems like there are two genes: one determining pigment color (C, C: red; c: plain) and another determining body color (B, B: brown; b: checkered). But the way it's written, it seems like two separate statements, which may not be intended. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that C is dominant for pigment, c is recessive, B is dominant for body color, and b is recessive. In that case, the previous analysis holds.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. Now, comparing this to the answer options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would imply Phenotype 3 (checkered brown) is 9, Phenotype 1 (checkered red) is 3, Phenotype 4 (plain red) is 1, Phenotype 2 (plain brown) is 3. Which aligns with our 9:3:3:1 ratios but inverted. Because in our system, Phenotype 1 is red-brown (9), Phenotype 2 is red-checkered (3), Phenotype 3 is plain-brown (3), Phenotype 4 is plain-checkered (1).\n\nOption E lists Phenotype 3 as checkered brown (9), which matches Phenotype 2 in our analysis. Option E also lists checkered red (3) and plain brown (3), which corresponds to Phenotypes 1 and 2 in our system. So option E seems to match our calculated ratios but in reverse. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nIn our system:\n- Phenotype 1: red-brown (9)\n- Phenotype 2: red-checkered (3)\n- Phenotype 3: plain-brown (3)\n- Phenotype 4: plain-checkered (1)\n\nOption E:\n- checkered red (3) \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype 1\n- checkered brown (9) \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype 2\n- plain red (1) \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype 4\n- plain brown (3) \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype 2\n\nWait, that doesn't match exactly because in our system, Phenotype 2 is red-checkered (3), and option E assigns checkered brown (9) as Phenotype 2, which is inconsistent because in our system, red-checkered is 3. Similarly, plain brown is 3, but option E labels it as checkered brown. So perhaps option E is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles without accounting for the order of genes. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the overall ratio.\n\nBut regardless, based on the standard Punnett square analysis, the correct phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. Checkered red 6, ... etc. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the ratio without normalization. Let me try a different approach. Instead of dividing into parts, let's look at the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on their alleles for each gene. The possible genotypic combinations are:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (dominant, red)\n- Cc (recessive, plain)\n- cc (dominant, plain)\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B:\n- BB (dominant, brown)\n- Bb (recessive, checkered)\n- bb (dominant, checkered)\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red brown?\nNo, wait, correct phenotypic expression is: \n- Pigment red: C is present\n- Brown: B is present\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these. Similarly,\n- Pigment red and checkered: C present, B absent\n- Plain red and brown: C absent, B present\n- Plain red and checkered: C absent, B absent\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet me list the possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C present, B present) \u2192 Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Wait, that can't be right because that would imply all birds have both traits, which isn't the case. Clearly, I've misunderstood something.\n\nAh! Wait a minute. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, but the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. So, for example, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown, regardless of C. Therefore, the phenotype is determined by both genes together, but each gene's effect is independent. So the combined phenotype is determined by both traits simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratios is by considering the combined presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's create a table of all possible combinations and count how many have each phenotype.\n\nPossible Genotypic Combinations (for each gene):\n\nGene C:\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (plain)\n- cc (plain)\n\nGene B:\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (checkered)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nCombined Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red-checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, brown \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red-brown): Cases 1,4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype 2 (Red-checkered): Cases 2,3,5,6 \u2192 4 cases\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown): Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain-checkered): Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nAssuming a large sample size, the ratio would be 2:4:2:1, which simplifies to 1:2:1:0.5, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it becomes 2:4:2:1. Now, looking at the answer options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This corresponds to Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown) : Phenotype 1 (Red-brown) : Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown) : Phenotype 1 (Red-brown) \u2192 2:2:1:1, scaled up by a factor of 3 to get 6:6:3:3, but that doesn't match exactly. Option A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option B: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This fits our count perfectly: 2+6=8? Wait, no. Our count was 2 cases for Red-brown, 4 for Red-checkered, 2 for Plain-brown, and 1 for Plain-checkered. So total is 9 birds. So scaling up by 3, we'd have 6 Red-brown, 12 Red-checkered, 6 Plain-brown, and 3 Plain-checkered. But the options don't have such high numbers. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is different. Wait, perhaps each bird is considered individually, so the counts are as follows: \n\nIn F2, each parent is CcBb. The F2 will have 9 birds. Each bird's phenotype is determined by their combination. So:\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Red-brown \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 2: Red-checkered \u2192 4 birds\n- Phenotype 3: Plain-brown \u2192 2 birds\n- Phenotype 4: Plain-checkered \u2192 1 bird\n\nTotal: 9 birds. The ratios are 2:4:2:1. To express this as a fraction of the total population, each phenotype's frequency is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 2/9\n- Phenotype 2: 4/9\n- Phenotype 3: 2/9\n- Phenotype 4: 1/9\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match this exact ratio, but option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would correspond to Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown) : Phenotype 1 (Red-brown) : Phenotype 3 (Plain-brown) : Phenotype 1 (Red-brown) \u2192 2:2:1:1, which is 6:6:3:3 when scaled up by 3. But the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is applied incorrectly. Another possibility is that the problem assumes a different approach, such as considering the percentage of each phenotype relative to each other without considering the entire population. But that complicates things further.\n\nGiven the available options, option E seems to have the correct ratios for checkered red and checkered brown, which are Phenotypes 1 and 3, respectively. Specifically, it states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Based on our analysis, checkered red (Phenotype 1) should be 2, checkered brown (Phenotype 3) should be 2, but option E has 3 and 9, which doesn't align. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check the probabilities.\n\nAnother approach: Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independent, so we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Gene C:\n\nPhenotype of pigment color (red or plain):\n- Red: probability = 1 - (probability of cc)\nSince the F1 is Cc, the probability of cc is 25%, so 75% chance of red.\n\n- Plain: 25%\n\nFor Gene B:\n\nPhenotype of body color (brown or checkered):\n- Brown: probability = 1 - (probability of bb)\nF1 is Bb, so probability of bb is 25%, thus 75% brown.\n\n- Checkered: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypic probabilities are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nThus, the combined phenotypic probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits present: 0.75 (C) * 0.75 (B) = 0.5625 \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Only C present: 0.75 (C) * 0.25 (not B) = 0.1875 \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Only B present: 0.25 (not C) * 0.75 (B) = 0.1875 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Neither trait present: 0.25 (not C) * 0.25 (not B) = 0.0625 \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThese add up to 1, confirming the calculations.\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into actual counts assuming a large population, say 16 birds (to avoid fractions), but since the options have higher numbers, perhaps we scale appropriately. However, the options don't provide 16 as a denominator. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratios without normalization, focusing solely on the proportionate distribution among the phenotypes.\n\nIn that case, the ratios would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 3/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nWhich doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers each bird's phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, leading to four phenotypes, each with a certain frequency.\n\nIf we take the ratios as 2:4:2:1, which sum to 9, the proportions are 2/9, 4/9, 2/9, 1/9. But the options don't reflect this exactly. Looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would suggest a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which totals 16. That doesn't match our 2:4:2:1. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant for pigment, and c is recessive. Wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, perhaps the presence of dominant allele C results in red, and recessive c results in plain. So, the dominant allele for color (C) is responsible for the color change from plain to red, while the recessive allele (c) is responsible for the color being plain.\n\nWait, that changes things. Earlier, I assumed that C was dominant for pigment, but according to this, perhaps C is the dominant allele for color, making it red, and c is the recessive allele for plain. So, the presence of at least one C allele results in red pigment, and the absence results in plain. Similarly, for the body color, B is the dominant allele for brown, and b is recessive for checkered. So, the presence of at least one B allele results in brown, and the absence results in checkered.\n\nThis changes the analysis because now, the presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype. So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both color and body. Let me redefine the phenotypes based on this understanding.\n\nPhenotype definitions:\n\n- Pigment red (C present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red-brown\n- Pigment red (C present) and body checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c present) and body brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c present) and body checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain-checkered\n\nNow, let's recalculate the probabilities.\n\nFor Pigment color (C/B):\n- Presence of C (C_: 3/4) \u2192 Pigment red\n- Absence of C (cc: 1/4) \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor Body color (B/b):\n- Presence of B (BB or Bb: 3/4) \u2192 Body brown\n- Absence of B (bb: 1/4) \u2192 Body checkered\n\nSince these are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and Body brown (B_: 3/4) \u2192 Phenotype 1: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C_) and Body checkered (bb: 1/4) \u2192 Phenotype 2: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n3. Pigment plain (cc) and Body brown (B_: 3/4) \u2192 Phenotype 3: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n4. Pigment plain (cc) and Body checkered (bb: 1/4) \u2192 Phenotype 4: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out. Now, mapping these probabilities to the answer choices.\n\nThe phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nExpressed as a ratio, this is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer options, none seem to match this exactly. However, let's compare with the options:\n\nOption A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 6:6:2:2 \u2192 Ratios simplify to 3:3:1:1\n\nOption B: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Simplified to 3:1:3:1\n\nOption C: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Same as B\n\nOption D: 6,1,3,1 \u2192 6:1:3:1\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nOur calculated ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype 1:9, Phenotype 2:3, Phenotype 3:3, Phenotype 4:1. None of the options exactly match this, but let's see if any of them approximate this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to the others, without normalizing to 16. For example, the ratio could be expressed as 9:3:3:1, which would mean Phenotype 1 is 9 units, Phenotype 2 is 3 units, etc. But the answer options don't have this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and instead count the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles regardless of order, treating each as a separate trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem initially. Let me read it again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color by the recessive allele c. Checkered color is controlled by a dominant gene B; brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. It seems like there are two genes: one determining pigment color (C, C: red; c: plain) and another determining body color (B, B: brown; b: checkered). But the way it's written, it seems like two separate statements, which may not be intended. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that C is dominant for pigment, c is recessive, B is dominant for body color, and b is recessive. In that case, the previous analysis holds.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-checkered. Now, comparing this to the answer options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would imply Phenotype 3 (checkered brown) is 9, Phenotype 1 (checkered red) is 3, Phenotype 4 (plain red) is 1, Phenotype 2 (plain brown) is 3. Which aligns with our 9:3:3:1 ratios but inverted. Because in our system, Phenotype 1 is red-brown (9), Phenotype 2 is red-checkered (3), Phenotype 3 is plain-brown (3), Phenotype 4 is plain-checkered (1).\n\nOption E lists Phenotype 3 as checkered brown (9), which matches Phenotype 2 in our analysis. Option E also lists checkered red (3) and plain brown (3), which corresponds to Phenotypes 1 and 2 in our system. So option E seems to match our calculated ratios but in reverse. Wait, let me clarify:\n\nIn our system:\n- Phenotype 1: red-brown (9)\n- Phenotype 2: red-checkered (3)\n- Phenotype 3: plain-brown (3)\n- Phenotype 4: plain-checkered (1)\n\nOption E:\n- checkered red (3) \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype 1\n- checkered brown (9) \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype 2\n- plain red (1) \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype 4\n- plain brown (3) \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype 2\n\nWait, that doesn't match exactly because in our system, Phenotype 2 is red-checkered (3), and option E assigns checkered brown (9) as Phenotype 2, which is inconsistent because in our system, red-checkered is 3. Similarly, plain brown is 3, but option E labels it as checkered brown. So perhaps option E is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles without accounting for the order of genes. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not the overall ratio.\n\nBut regardless, based on the standard Punnett square analysis, the correct phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1,",

    "chunk_removed": "A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

So in terms of numbers, if we assume N=16, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nLooking at the options, option C states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, but according to our calculations, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype B, which is 3, and checkered brown would be Phenotype A, which is 9. Similarly, plain red is Phenotype C (3), plain brown is Phenotype D (1). So option C matches exactly. But wait, looking back, option C says \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which aligns with our calculations. However, let me double-check because sometimes the terminology can be confusing. In the original question, the options mention \"phenotypes\" and \"genotypes.\" Wait, perhaps I misread the options.

Wait, but I thought Phenotype A is red and brown, which is 9, Phenotype B is red and checkered, which is 3, Phenotype C is plain and brown, which is 3, and Phenotype D is plain and checkered, which is 1.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB.",
    "rollout": " \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo all options add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the expected ratios are 9:3:3:1 for each phenotype, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the initial analysis, I thought the answer was option E, but now I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the initial question states that the parents are homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and plain brown (cc bb). So when they mate, F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, what do we get? Let's create the Punnett square:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb (each 25%). So F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A (both traits)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (only C)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (only C)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D (neither)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation: The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the ratio of the phenotypes is based on the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio is derived from the combination of the two genes. As previously determined, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown respectively. This corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the options, option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which sums to 16. So why does option E have higher numbers? Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio. Let me double-check. The correct phenotypic ratio for two traits, each with two alleles, is indeed 9:3:3:1. So option C should be the correct answer. However, none of the options seem to align perfectly. Wait, option E has 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 3 plain brown, totaling 16. That also fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypic classes. Let me clarify: \n- Checkered red: occurs when both C and B are recessive (cc and bb), resulting in both traits missing.\n- Checkered brown: occurs when C is dominant (C present) and B is recessive (b present).\n- Plain red: occurs when C is recessive (c present) and B is dominant (B present).\n- Plain brown: occurs when both C and B are recessive.\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the options where the numbers add up to 16. Option E presents the ratio as 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse order but still sums to 16. However, the original question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Depending on how the phenotypes are labeled, option E may represent the ratio in a different order. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be presented in terms of each phenotype's count relative to the others, leading to option E being the correct choice. After careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo all options add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the expected ratios are 9:3:3:1 for each phenotype, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the initial analysis, I thought the answer was option E, but now I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the initial question states that the parents are homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and plain brown (cc bb). So when they mate, F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, what do we get? Let's create the Punnett square:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only produce cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb (each 25%). So F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A (both traits)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (only C)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (only C)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D (neither)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation: The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the ratio of the phenotypes is based on the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio is derived from the combination of the two genes. As previously determined, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown respectively. This corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the options, option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which sums to 16. So why does option E have higher numbers? Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio. Let me double-check. The correct phenotypic ratio for two traits, each with two alleles, is indeed 9:3:3:1. So option C should be the correct answer. However, none of the options seem to align perfectly. Wait, option E has 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 3 plain brown, totaling 16. That also fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypic classes. Let me clarify: \n- Checkered red: occurs when both C and B are recessive (cc and bb), resulting in both traits missing.\n- Checkered brown: occurs when C is dominant (C present) and B is recessive (b present).\n- Plain red: occurs when C is recessive (c present) and B is dominant (B present).\n- Plain brown: occurs when both C and B are recessive.\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the options where the numbers add up to 16. Option E presents the ratio as 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse order but still sums to 16. However, the original question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Depending on how the phenotypes are labeled, option E may represent the ratio in a different order. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be presented in terms of each phenotype's count relative to the others, leading to option E being the correct choice. After careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThat adds up to 16, which aligns with our calculations. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively. So looking at the options, option E states this exact ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A. Checkered red 6, ...; B.",
    "rollout": " A. Checkered red 6, ...; B. 8,4,0,4; C. 9,3,...; D. 1,3,9,3; E. 3,9,1,3.\n\nOur calculations suggest that the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E, where checkered red (which would correspond to phenotype D, neither trait) is 9, checkered brown (pheno B) is 3, plain red (pheno C) is 3, and plain brown (pheno A) is 1. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, pheno A is both traits present, which is 9/16, pheno B is only C (3/16), pheno C is only B (3/16), and pheno D is neither (1/16). So the order would be: checkered red (D) is 1/16, checkered brown (B) is 3/16, plain red (C) is 3/16, plain brown (A) is 9/16. Wait, but that's reversed compared to what I thought before. Because in the options, checkered red is listed as the first choice, but according to our analysis, it's the last option. Hmm, I must have mixed up the phenotypes somewhere. Let me double-check:\n\nPhenotype A: both traits \u2192 red and brown\nPhenotype B: only C \u2192 red and checkered\nPhenotype C: only B \u2192 plain and brown\nPhenotype D: neither \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, 3 parts plain red, 1 part plain brown. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply that checkered red is 3, which contradicts our calculation. Option B says checkered red 8, etc., which also doesn't fit. Option H is similar. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't align. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is all equal, which can't be right. Option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't add up either. Wait, perhaps I misassigned the phenotypes. Let me try again. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratios are presented inversely, such that checkered red is 9, plain brown is 3, etc. Wait, no, because in the standard notation, checkered red would be the phenotype where neither trait is present, i.e., plain and checkered. Which according to our earlier analysis is 1/16, which is less than 1/4. But looking at the options, none seem to directly reflect this. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me re-express the probabilities correctly. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the correct approach is to consider the combined effect. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192Plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192Plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (both traits):\n- P(C) = 1 (any C allele gives red)\n- P(B) = 1 (any B allele gives brown)\n- P(phenotype 1) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nBut this can't be correct because it implies certain phenotypes dominate others without considering the distribution. Instead, we should calculate the probabilities based on the independent assortment of the two genes. The correct method involves determining the proportion of each phenotype among all possible combinations.\n\nEach bird's genotype can be represented by two letters for each gene, e.g., for the C locus: CC, Cc, or cc, and similarly for the B locus. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. The Punnett square for the F2 generation should thus list all possible combinations of the four genes (two for each parent), but since each bird has two traits, we need to combine the results accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, a better approach is to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the independent assortment of the two genes. The F2 generation will have a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but since the presence of each trait is independent, the overall phenotype ratio is determined by multiplying the individual ratios. However, in reality, the presence of one trait may affect the likelihood of another due to dominance, but in this case, dominance is straightforward (recessive alleles are always expressed).\n\nLet me attempt to construct the Punnett square correctly. Each parent is CcBB (since CC BB is homozygous dominant for C and B). Wait, no\u2014if the parent is CC BB, then for the C locus, it's CC (so C is present), and for the B locus, it's BB (so B is present). Therefore, when crossed with cc bb, the F1 will be CcBb. In the F2 generation, each gene is independently assorting. The F2 for the C locus will have probabilities: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Similarly for the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. The phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of C (for pigment) and B (for body color). \n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the number of birds in each phenotype group. The phenotypic groups are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: Pigment red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: Pigment red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each group:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B are present.\n  - For C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C)\n  - For B: 3/4 (same reasoning)\n  - Since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C present (no B).\n  - For C: 3/4\n  - For B: 1/4\n  - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Only B present (no C).\n  - For B: 3/4\n  - For C: 1/4\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present.\n  - For C: 1/4\n  - For B: 1/4\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. This means:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): 1 part\n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This suggests that checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which doesn't align with our calculation. Our calculation shows checkered red (D) is 1 part, while checkered brown (B) is 3 parts. None of the options match perfectly, but option E might be the closest if we consider that checkered red refers to the phenotype where neither trait is present, but according to our analysis, it's the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps the options are labeled incorrectly, and the intended answer was option E, despite the mismatch. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the letters are swapped. Let me double-check. The options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nGiven that, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But option C has 9:3:3:1, which seems correct. So perhaps option C is the answer. Let me verify.\n\nIn option C, checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, option C should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. Checkered red 6, ...; B. 8,4,0,4; C. 9,3,...; D. 1,3,9,3; E. 3,9,1,3.\n\nOur calculations suggest that the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E, where checkered red (which would correspond to phenotype D, neither trait) is 9, checkered brown (pheno B) is 3, plain red (pheno C) is 3, and plain brown (pheno A) is 1. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, pheno A is both traits present, which is 9/16, pheno B is only C (3/16), pheno C is only B (3/16), and pheno D is neither (1/16). So the order would be: checkered red (D) is 1/16, checkered brown (B) is 3/16, plain red (C) is 3/16, plain brown (A) is 9/16. Wait, but that's reversed compared to what I thought before. Because in the options, checkered red is listed as the first choice, but according to our analysis, it's the last option. Hmm, I must have mixed up the phenotypes somewhere. Let me double-check:\n\nPhenotype A: both traits \u2192 red and brown\nPhenotype B: only C \u2192 red and checkered\nPhenotype C: only B \u2192 plain and brown\nPhenotype D: neither \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, 3 parts plain red, 1 part plain brown. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply that checkered red is 3, which contradicts our calculation. Option B says checkered red 8, etc., which also doesn't fit. Option H is similar. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which doesn't align. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is all equal, which can't be right. Option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't add up either. Wait, perhaps I misassigned the phenotypes. Let me try again. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratios are presented inversely, such that checkered red is 9, plain brown is 3, etc. Wait, no, because in the standard notation, checkered red would be the phenotype where neither trait is present, i.e., plain and checkered. Which according to our earlier analysis is 1/16, which is less than 1/4. But looking at the options, none seem to directly reflect this. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me re-express the probabilities correctly. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the correct approach is to consider the combined effect. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192Plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192Plain and checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (both traits):\n- P(C) = 1 (any C allele gives red)\n- P(B) = 1 (any B allele gives brown)\n- P(phenotype 1) = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nBut this can't be correct because it implies certain phenotypes dominate others without considering the distribution. Instead, we should calculate the probabilities based on the independent assortment of the two genes. The correct method involves determining the proportion of each phenotype among all possible combinations.\n\nEach bird's genotype can be represented by two letters for each gene, e.g., for the C locus: CC, Cc, or cc, and similarly for the B locus. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. The Punnett square for the F2 generation should thus list all possible combinations of the four genes (two for each parent), but since each bird has two traits, we need to combine the results accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, a better approach is to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the independent assortment of the two genes. The F2 generation will have a 3:1 ratio for each gene, but since the presence of each trait is independent, the overall phenotype ratio is determined by multiplying the individual ratios. However, in reality, the presence of one trait may affect the likelihood of another due to dominance, but in this case, dominance is straightforward (recessive alleles are always expressed).\n\nLet me attempt to construct the Punnett square correctly. Each parent is CcBB (since CC BB is homozygous dominant for C and B). Wait, no\u2014if the parent is CC BB, then for the C locus, it's CC (so C is present), and for the B locus, it's BB (so B is present). Therefore, when crossed with cc bb, the F1 will be CcBb. In the F2 generation, each gene is independently assorting. The F2 for the C locus will have probabilities: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Similarly for the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. The phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of C (for pigment) and B (for body color). \n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we can calculate the number of birds in each phenotype group. The phenotypic groups are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: Pigment red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: Pigment red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each group:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B are present.\n  - For C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C)\n  - For B: 3/4 (same reasoning)\n  - Since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Only C present (no B).\n  - For C: 3/4\n  - For B: 1/4\n  - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Only B present (no C).\n  - For B: 3/4\n  - For C: 1/4\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present.\n  - For C: 1/4\n  - For B: 1/4\n  - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. This means:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): 1 part\n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This suggests that checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which doesn't align with our calculation. Our calculation shows checkered red (D) is 1 part, while checkered brown (B) is 3 parts. None of the options match perfectly, but option E might be the closest if we consider that checkered red refers to the phenotype where neither trait is present, but according to our analysis, it's the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps the options are labeled incorrectly, and the intended answer was option E, despite the mismatch. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the letters are swapped. Let me double-check. The options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nGiven that, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But option C has 9:3:3:1, which seems correct. So perhaps option C is the answer. Let me verify.\n\nIn option C, checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, option C should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

So the counts would be approximately 9,3,3,1 in a group of 16. But looking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, close but not matching 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me re-examine. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). So each gene is independently assorting. For each gene, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% chance. So the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nSame for gene B:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, applying this to the total number of offspring, let's assume the total is 16 for simplicity. Then, each phenotype would occur 1 time (since 16 divided by 16 is 1). But in reality, the number of offspring will vary, but the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match this ratio. Option E has 3,9,1,3\u2014which is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we expect.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. Checkered red 6, etc.\u2014doesn't fit. H. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, etc.\u2014also doesn't fit. Let me double-check. My calculations gave us 9:3:3:1 for each phenotype. So the counts would be approximately 9,3,3,1 in a group of 16. But looking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, close but not matching 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me re-examine. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). So each gene is independently assorting. For each gene, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50% chance. So the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nSame for gene B:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, applying this to the total number of offspring, let's assume the total is 16 for simplicity. Then, each phenotype would occur 1 time (since 16 divided by 16 is 1). But in reality, the number of offspring will vary, but the ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none exactly match this ratio. Option E has 3,9,1,3\u2014which is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we expect. Our expectation is 9:3:3:1, so the correct ratio is checkered red (phenotype A) 9, checkered brown (phenotype B) 3, plain red (phenotype C) 3, plain brown (phenotype D) 1.\n\nLooking at the options, none have exactly 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 1:1:1:1 \u2192 No.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 2:1:0:1 \u2192 No.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes!

Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

So in terms of counts, if we have 16 birds, 9 would be phenotype A, 3 each for B and C, and 1 for D. But looking at the options, E states exactly that: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. This corresponds to the probabilities we've calculated.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, the probabilities are 9,3,3,1, which correspond to option C. However, none of the options directly state 9,3,3,1. Option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which also sums to 16. Hmm, but why does the count differ?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The options describe the counts as:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich aligns with our calculation of 1,3,3,9. Wait, no\u2014that's 1+3+3+9=16. But in reality, the correct counts are 9,3,3,1, which would be option C. However, none of the options exactly match this. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions are labeled A through J, each with specific counts. For example, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which corresponds to 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. But according to our analysis, the correct order should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But in the options, option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, that's 9:3:3:1, matching our calculation. However, looking back, option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which is 3:9:1:3. These are reciprocal of what we have. That suggests that perhaps I misassigned the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the phenotypes:\n\nIn my previous analysis, I considered:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc BB): Phenotype A: both C and B present \u2192 9 parts\n2. Checkered brown (cc bb): Phenotype B: only B present \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain red (cc BB): Wait, no\u2014if both c and B are recessive, then the bird is plain and brown. Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotypes are based on whether the dominant alleles are present. So:\n\nPhenotype A: both C and B dominant \u2192 red and brown (9 parts)\n\nPhenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red and checkered (3 parts)\n\nPhenotype C: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown (3 parts)\n\nPhenotype D: c dominant, b dominant \u2192 plain and checkered (1 part)\n\nSo the counts should be A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1, which is option C. However, the options don't have option C; let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 2,6,3,9\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nHmm, so option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our analysis. However, in the options provided, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. But according to our calculations, the correct order is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, none of the options directly state this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me re-express the phenotypes clearly:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n\n- Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n\n- Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n\n- Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, according to our calculations, the counts are 9,3,3,1 for these phenotypes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, the probabilities are 9,3,3,1, which correspond to option C. However, none of the options directly state 9,3,3,1. Option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which also sums to 16. Hmm, but why does the count differ?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The options describe the counts as:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich aligns with our calculation of 1,3,3,9. Wait, no\u2014that's 1+3+3+9=16. But in reality, the correct counts are 9,3,3,1, which would be option C. However, none of the options exactly match this. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions are labeled A through J, each with specific counts. For example, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which corresponds to 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. But according to our analysis, the correct order should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But in the options, option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, that's 9:3:3:1, matching our calculation. However, looking back, option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which is 3:9:1:3. These are reciprocal of what we have. That suggests that perhaps I misassigned the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the phenotypes:\n\nIn my previous analysis, I considered:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc BB): Phenotype A: both C and B present \u2192 9 parts\n2. Checkered brown (cc bb): Phenotype B: only B present \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain red (cc BB): Wait, no\u2014if both c and B are recessive, then the bird is plain and brown. Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotypes are based on whether the dominant alleles are present. So:\n\nPhenotype A: both C and B dominant \u2192 red and brown (9 parts)\n\nPhenotype B: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red and checkered (3 parts)\n\nPhenotype C: c dominant, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown (3 parts)\n\nPhenotype D: c dominant, b dominant \u2192 plain and checkered (1 part)\n\nSo the counts should be A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1, which is option C. However, the options don't have option C; let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 2,6,3,9\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nHmm, so option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our analysis. However, in the options provided, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. But according to our calculations, the correct order is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, none of the options directly state this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me re-express the phenotypes clearly:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n\n- Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n\n- Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n\n- Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, according to our calculations, the counts are 9,3,3,1 for these phenotypes. But looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nD. 2,6,3,9 \u2192 20\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nSo option C is correct as it sums to 16, matching our calculation. However, in the original question, the options are presented without labels, so perhaps I misunderstood the question's structure. The user provided multiple-choice options, and the answer should choose the correct one. Based on our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are:",

We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo all options add up to 16.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Wait, the options are:",

But looking back, I think I may have miscalculated. Because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So the correct ratios should be:\n\nPhenotype A (red and brown): 9/16 of the population\nPhenotype B (red and checkered): 3/16\nPhenotype C (plain and brown): 3/16\nPhenotype D (plain and checkered): 1/16\n\nSo in terms of counts, if we take 16 birds, we'd have 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, and 1 D. But looking at the options, none have exactly this. Option C says 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Wait, no, option C is: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with what we've calculated. Wait, I think I messed up the labels.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,2; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3. Hmm, our calculations suggest a ratio of 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. But looking back, I think I may have miscalculated. Because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So the correct ratios should be:\n\nPhenotype A (red and brown): 9/16 of the population\nPhenotype B (red and checkered): 3/16\nPhenotype C (plain and brown): 3/16\nPhenotype D (plain and checkered): 1/16\n\nSo in terms of counts, if we take 16 birds, we'd have 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, and 1 D. But looking at the options, none have exactly this. Option C says 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Wait, no, option C is: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with what we've calculated. Wait, I think I messed up the labels. Let me clarify:\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C c B b \u2192 both C and B recessive, but wait no\u2014wait, C is present (C) and B is present (B)? No, C is recessive (c), and B is recessive (b). So that bird is plain red. Hmm, I think I mixed up the labels. Let me re-express:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Pigmented red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Pigmented red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, according to our probabilities, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A:B:C:D = 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C states: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Wait, that doesn't align because checkered red is Phenotype A, which should be 9, checkered brown is Phenotype B (3), plain red is Phenotype C (3), and plain brown is Phenotype D (1). Yes, that matches option C. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A: checkered red 6, ...; E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc. So according to my calculations, Phenotype A (red and brown) would have 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered) 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) 3, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) 1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That aligns with Phenotype B (red and checkered) having 3, Phenotype A (red and brown) having 9, Phenotype C (plain and brown) having 1, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) having 3. So the order in the options is:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, ...\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that matches. So the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: \n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, according to my calculations, the expected ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's 9+3+3+1=16. But perhaps the scale factor is different because the actual number of offspring depends on the parents' contribution. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects the counts without dividing by the total, so 9,3,3,1. Therefore, the correct option would be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: Option E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. So that totals 16, which aligns with our calculations. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,2,6; B.8,4,0,4; C.9,3,3,1; D.1,3,9,3; E.3,9,1,3. Hmm, according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But let me double-check. Are the calculations correct? For each bird:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C. Therefore, the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
