    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Wait, no\u2014that's not matching the letters.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16, which is the total number of offspring. So which one is correct?

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options have a sum of 16. Hmm, but according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1. Wait, but the options are presented as checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. Wait, no, the options are:\n\nA.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 L.1,1,1,1 M.2,2,2,2 N.3,3,3,3 O.4,4,4,4 P.12,2,2,0 Q.5,3,2,6 R.3,9,1,3 S.4,4,4,4 T.1,3,9,3 U.7,5,1,3 V.5,3,2,6 W.3,9,1,3 X.12,2,2,0 Y.5,3,2,6 Z.3,9,1,3 All of the options seem to add up to 16, except option F which sums to 16.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

    "rollout": " So all options sum to 16. Now, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, I might have made a mistake. Because when both C and B are present, the bird is red and brown. If only C is present, it's red and checkered. Only B is present, it's plain and brown. Neither is present, plain and checkered. So the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1. But let me verify this once more.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the corresponding trait. So, for pigment color, C is dominant (red) over c (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown) over b (checkered). Therefore, a bird can have:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C and not B: red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Not C and B: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4.

Wait, no\u2014if both genes are present, the bird is red and brown. If only one is present, it's red and checkered or plain and brown. Only if neither is present does it have neither trait. So, the probabilities are:\n\n- P(A) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Wait, that can\u2019t be right because some birds wouldn\u2019t have either trait. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider. The correct way is to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the possible combinations. For a bird to have both traits (A), it must have at least one C and at least one B. Similarly for the others. So:\n\n- P(A) = P(at least C and at least B) = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- P(B) = P(at least C but not B) = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- P(C) = P(not C but at least B) = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- P(D) = P(neither C nor B) = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 So all options sum to 16. Now, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, I might have made a mistake. Because when both C and B are present, the bird is red and brown. If only C is present, it's red and checkered. Only B is present, it's plain and brown. Neither is present, plain and checkered. So the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1. But let me verify this once more.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the corresponding trait. So, for pigment color, C is dominant (red) over c (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown) over b (checkered). Therefore, a bird can have:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C and not B: red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Not C and B: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B: plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\n- P(A) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 All birds have at least one dominant allele, so A is 100%, but that's not possible because some birds may have neither. Wait, no\u2014if both genes are present, the bird is red and brown. If only one is present, it's red and checkered or plain and brown. Only if neither is present does it have neither trait. So, the probabilities are:\n\n- P(A) = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 Wait, that can\u2019t be right because some birds wouldn\u2019t have either trait. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider. The correct way is to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the possible combinations. For a bird to have both traits (A), it must have at least one C and at least one B. Similarly for the others. So:\n\n- P(A) = P(at least C and at least B) = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- P(B) = P(at least C but not B) = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- P(C) = P(not C but at least B) = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- P(D) = P(neither C nor B) = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, looking back at the options, none directly state this. The closest is option C, which states 9,3,3,1. But the options also include numbers like 1,3,9,3 (option D), etc. So why is option C the answer?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\n\nWait, according to our calculations, the expected ratios should be 9:3:3:1 for the F2 generation. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to 3:9:1:3, which is a common Mendelian ratio, but scaled up. Wait, but 9:3:3:1 is the correct ratio for two independent traits. Hmm, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check. For each bird, the probability of having both traits present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, only C is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, only B is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, and neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Adding these together gives 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the expected ratios are 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we got. But that's not possible because the order matters. The first phenotype is checkered red, which would correspond to the birds that have both C and b (i.e., c is recessive). Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. Wait, the phenotypes are determined by both genes:\n\n- Checkered: c (recessive) for pigment (so C is dominant) and b (recessive) for color (so B is dominant).\n- Plain: cc (no C) and bb (no B).\n\nSo, the checkered phenotype is when a bird has both recessive alleles (c and b). The checkered red phenotype would be when the bird has dominant C (so red pigment) but recessive c (so plain body), and also has dominant B (so brown color). Wait, no, the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive. So:\n\n- Checkered: c and b \u2192 c (recessive) for pigment, b (recessive) for color \u2192 phenotype is plain red.\n- Plain: cc and bb \u2192 phenotype is plain.\n- Checkered brown: c and B \u2192 so red pigment (since C is dominant), but plain body (because c is recessive). Wait, no\u2014c is recessive for pigment, so if a bird has c, it's plain, not checkered. So perhaps I messed up the terminology. Wait, the terms \"checkered\" and \"plain\" refer to the genes themselves, not the phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered: c (recessive) for pigment and b (recessive) for color \u2192 phenotype is plain, but the term \"checkered\" refers to the fact that both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. The term \"checkered\" typically refers to the pigmentation, while \"plain\" refers to the absence of a certain trait. So:\n\n- Checkered: the bird is c (recessive) for pigment and b (recessive) for color. This results in a phenotype that appears as checkered, indicating both genes are recessive. However, the term \"checkered\" is often used interchangeably with \"plain\" in some contexts, so perhaps the correct understanding is that checkered refers to the absence of the dominant traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are defined as:\n\n- Checkered: both genes are recessive (c and b)\n- Plain: both genes are dominant (C and B)\n\nAnd the intermediate phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown: recessive pigment (c) and dominant color (B)\n- Checkered red: recessive pigment (c) and recessive color (b)\n- Plain red: dominant pigment (C) and recessive color (b)\n- Plain brown: dominant pigment (C) and dominant color (B)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C dominant, B recessive\n- Checkered brown: C recessive, B dominant\n- Plain red: C recessive, B recessive\n- Plain brown: C dominant, B dominant\n\nIn that case, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but weighted by the probabilities. Earlier, I thought it was 9:3:3:1, but now I'm confused. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Checkered brown\n2. One dominant, one recessive (C and b or c and B): Checkered red or plain brown\n3. Both genes recessive (c and b): Plain red or plain brown?\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has both genes recessive (c and b), it would be plain red (since C is dominant, so c would mean plain red) and also plain brown (since B is recessive, so b would mean plain brown). So in reality, having both recessive alleles (c and b) results in both traits being absent, hence the phenotype is simply plain. But the terms \"checkered\" and \"plain\" might overlap here. However, in standard genetic terminology, the \"checkered\" phenotype refers to the presence of both recessive alleles, resulting in a phenotype that looks like it has both traits. So, for example:\n\n- Checkered red: C dominant, B recessive (so red pigment, plain body)\n- Checkered brown: c dominant, B dominant (plain pigment, red body)\n- Plain red: c dominant, b recessive (plain pigment, black body)\n- Plain brown: C dominant, B dominant (red pigment, brown body)\n\nThus, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: (C B) \u2192 9 parts\n2. Checkered brown: (cb) \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain red: (cc B) \u2192 3 parts\n4. Plain brown: (cc bb) \u2192 1 part\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what we have. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which is 6:2:6:2 \u2192 adding to 16. Option B is 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1 \u2192 which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be C. However, looking back, the options are labeled A to Z, with C being 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but in the options provided, option C is written as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns with our calculation of 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 L.6,4,2,4 \u2192 sum 16 M.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 N.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 O.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 P.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 Q.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 R.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 S.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 T.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 U.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 V.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 W.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 X.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 Y.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 Z.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 AA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\n\nWait, according to our calculations, the expected ratios should be 9:3:3:1 for the F2 generation. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to 3:9:1:3, which is a common Mendelian ratio, but scaled up. Wait, but 9:3:3:1 is the correct ratio for two independent traits. Hmm, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check. For each bird, the probability of having both traits present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, only C is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, only B is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, and neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Adding these together gives 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the expected ratios are 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we got. But that's not possible because the order matters. The first phenotype is checkered red, which would correspond to the birds that have both C and b (i.e., c is recessive). Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. Wait, the phenotypes are determined by both genes:\n\n- Checkered: c (recessive) for pigment (so C is dominant) and b (recessive) for color (so B is dominant).\n- Plain: cc (no C) and bb (no B).\n\nSo, the checkered phenotype is when a bird has both recessive alleles (c and b). The checkered red phenotype would be when the bird has dominant C (so red pigment) but recessive c (so plain body), and also has dominant B (so brown color). Wait, no, the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive. So:\n\n- Checkered: c and b \u2192 c (recessive) for pigment, b (recessive) for color \u2192 phenotype is plain red.\n- Plain: cc and bb \u2192 phenotype is plain.\n- Checkered brown: c and B \u2192 so red pigment (since C is dominant), but plain body (because c is recessive). Wait, no\u2014c is recessive for pigment, so if a bird has c, it's plain, not checkered. So perhaps I messed up the terminology. Wait, the terms \"checkered\" and \"plain\" refer to the genes themselves, not the phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered: c (recessive) for pigment and b (recessive) for color \u2192 phenotype is plain, but the term \"checkered\" refers to the fact that both genes are recessive. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. The term \"checkered\" typically refers to the pigmentation, while \"plain\" refers to the absence of a certain trait. So:\n\n- Checkered: the bird is c (recessive) for pigment and b (recessive) for color. This results in a phenotype that appears as checkered, indicating both genes are recessive. However, the term \"checkered\" is often used interchangeably with \"plain\" in some contexts, so perhaps the correct understanding is that checkered refers to the absence of the dominant traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are defined as:\n\n- Checkered: both genes are recessive (c and b)\n- Plain: both genes are dominant (C and B)\n\nAnd the intermediate phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered brown: recessive pigment (c) and dominant color (B)\n- Checkered red: recessive pigment (c) and recessive color (b)\n- Plain red: dominant pigment (C) and recessive color (b)\n- Plain brown: dominant pigment (C) and dominant color (B)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C dominant, B recessive\n- Checkered brown: C recessive, B dominant\n- Plain red: C recessive, B recessive\n- Plain brown: C dominant, B dominant\n\nIn that case, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but weighted by the probabilities. Earlier, I thought it was 9:3:3:1, but now I'm confused. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C and B): Checkered brown\n2. One dominant, one recessive (C and b or c and B): Checkered red or plain brown\n3. Both genes recessive (c and b): Plain red or plain brown?\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has both genes recessive (c and b), it would be plain red (since C is dominant, so c would mean plain red) and also plain brown (since B is recessive, so b would mean plain brown). So in reality, having both recessive alleles (c and b) results in both traits being absent, hence the phenotype is simply plain. But the terms \"checkered\" and \"plain\" might overlap here. However, in standard genetic terminology, the \"checkered\" phenotype refers to the presence of both recessive alleles, resulting in a phenotype that looks like it has both traits. So, for example:\n\n- Checkered red: C dominant, B recessive (so red pigment, plain body)\n- Checkered brown: c dominant, B dominant (plain pigment, red body)\n- Plain red: c dominant, b recessive (plain pigment, black body)\n- Plain brown: C dominant, B dominant (red pigment, brown body)\n\nThus, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: (C B) \u2192 9 parts\n2. Checkered brown: (cb) \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain red: (cc B) \u2192 3 parts\n4. Plain brown: (cc bb) \u2192 1 part\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what we have. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which is 6:2:6:2 \u2192 adding to 16. Option B is 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum 16. Option C is 9:3:3:1 \u2192 which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be C. However, looking back, the options are labeled A to Z, with C being 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but in the options provided, option C is written as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns with our calculation of 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16.

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "All options sum to 16, so they are consistent with the 16 parts.",
    "rollout": " All options sum to 16, so they are consistent with the 16 parts. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in F2. Let me verify the calculations again. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F1 can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one gamete, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are 25% CcBb, 50% Ccbb, and 25% ccbb.\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 50%\n- Phenotype D: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25 : 50 : 25, which simplifies to 1 : 2 : 1. But looking at the options, none directly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me recount. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 both dominant traits present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Ccbb \u2192 only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 neither present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these has a certain frequency in the population. The frequency of each genotype is 25%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. Now, for each phenotype, we need to count how many times each appears in terms of the number of birds with that phenotype. Since each bird has two traits, the number of birds with a particular phenotype is determined by the number of individuals who exhibit those traits. \n\nFor example, in the F2 generation, the number of birds with both traits (Phenotype A) would be 25% of the total, Phenotype B (only C) would be 50%, and Phenotype D (none) would be 25%.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided:\n\nOption E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16, which aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but why does Option E have 3,9,1,3 instead of 25,50,25,25? Because the options are scaled. Perhaps the scale factor is such that each part represents 1 bird, so Phenotype A is 9, B is 3, C is 1, D is 3. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. The F2 generation consists of 25% CcBb, 50% Ccbb, and 25% ccbb. Each of these corresponds to Phenotypes A, B, and D. The number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds with those genotypes. Assuming a large population, the distribution is roughly 25% A, 50% B, and 25% D. But since the options provide integer values, we need to scale these percentages to whole numbers. 25% is approx 1, 50% is 2, and 25% is 1. So the ratio would be 1:2:1:2, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is 16, making each percentage correspond to 16 birds. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Phenotype B: 50% of 16 = 8 birds\n- Phenotype D: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified, rounding to the nearest multiple. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nIf the ratio is 1:2:1:2, then the closest would be option E, which is 3:9:1:3, but that scales by 3, making it 9:27:3:9, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the scaling factor is 16, leading to 4:8:4:4, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the original question expects us to ignore dominance and treat each trait independently, leading to a different outcome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The options suggest ratios like 6:2:6:2, which add up to 16. This suggests that the phenotypic ratio is 6,2,6,2 across the four phenotypes. Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, the phenotypes are based on both genes, resulting in a 1:2:1:2 ratio, which would correspond to 4:8:4:4 if scaled up by 4. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each gene's effect is considered separately without accounting for the other, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem treats each gene independently, meaning that for each bird, the chance of having pigment red is 1 (since C is dominant), and brown is 1 (since B is dominant). Therefore, all birds would have both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that contradicts the options, as the ratios don't reflect equal representation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the phenotypic ratio based on the dominance of each gene, treating each trait independently.\n\nIn that case, for each bird, the probability of having pigment red is 1 (since C is dominant), and the probability of having brown is 1 (since B is dominant). Therefore, every bird would have both traits, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, this isn't reflected in the options, which all have varying ratios.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of both dominant alleles, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since the options don't include this, I must reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers each gene's effect separately, ignoring the interaction. So, for pigment color, the presence of C results in red, and the presence of B results in brown. But since both genes are required for a particular phenotype, the presence of either dominant allele allows that trait. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:2:1:2, which would translate to 4:8:4:4 if scaled up by 4. But this still doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16, which fits the total number of birds. This suggests that the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is a classic Mendelian ratio. How did that happen?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is treating each trait independently, so the checkered color (which requires both genes to be recessive) occurs in 1/4 of the cases, while the others occur in 3/4. So, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/4 (only C and B present) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 1/4 (C present, B absent) \u2192 1 part\n- Plain red: 1/4 (C absent, B present) \u2192 1 part\n- Plain brown: 1/4 (neither present) \u2192 1 part\n\nBut this sums to 4 parts, not 16. Alternatively, if the scale factor is 16, each part becomes 4 birds. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nWhich totals 16 birds. But this doesn't match the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats each trait as a separate event, leading to the ratio 3:9:1:3, which is the typical 1:3:3:1 pattern for two independent genes when counting the occurrences of each genotype. However, this is for diploid organisms where each trait is influenced by one gene, but in this case, both genes influence the same trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, treating each gene's effect independently. For pigment color, the presence of C makes it red, and for body color, the presence of B makes it brown. The checkered appearance (cB) occurs when both genes are recessive. The phenotypic ratios can be thought of as:\n\n- Red and Brown: Both C and B present \u2192 1/4 of the time\n- Red and Checkered: C present, B absent \u2192 1/4\n- Checkered and Brown: C absent, B present \u2192 1/4\n- Checkered and Checkered: Neither present \u2192 1/4\n\nThis gives a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, if each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't reflect this, so I must conclude that I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nPerhaps the problem is asking for the ratio in terms of the number of checkered vs non-checkered, or vice versa. Let me recast the problem: the F2 generation has the following phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: checkered (cB) and red (RR, BB) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Checkered brown: checkered (cB) and brown (rr, bb) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain red: red (RR, BB) and brown (rr, bb) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain checkered: checkered (cB) and red (RR, BB) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are based on the combination of the genes. Since the F2 generation is 25% CcBb, 50% Ccbb, and 25% ccbb, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Checkered red): 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- Phenotype 2 (Checkered brown): 25% of 50% = 12.5%\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain red): 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain checkered): 50% of 25% = 12.5%\n\nBut none of the options match these exact percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting an approximate whole number ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number. 6.25 is approximately 6, 12.5 is approximately 13, etc. But that doesn't align with the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy, where the presence of a dominant allele overrides the recessive one. But that's already accounted for in the Punnett squares.\n\nWait, going back to the initial Punnett square analysis, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing it. Let me try again.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nF1: Cc Bb (all possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, CC, cc, BB, bb?) Wait, no\u2014each parent can only produce one type of gamete due to dominance. Wait, no\u2014because both parents are homozygous, they will produce only one type of gamete each. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes CB. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes cb. Therefore, the F1 will be Cc Bb, and it will produce only one type of gamete, CB, from each parent. Thus, the F2 will only have the genotype Cc Bb, which combines with itself to produce 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% ccbb. Now, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- ccbb: Checkered checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1, but scaled appropriately. However, since the options don't reflect this, I must consider that the problem is referring to the number of checkered versus non-checkered within each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy in a different manner. For instance, if the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of the other trait. But that complicates things further.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem is using a different definition of checkered. Checkered typically refers to having both parents' alleles, i.e., cc BB or cc bb. In this case, the F2 would have:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered (since C and B are dominant)\n- ccBb: Non-checkered (since c is recessive for C)\n- ccbb: Checkered (since c is recessive for B)\n- Ccbb: Non-checkered (since B is recessive for B)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CcBb (red and brown)\n- Checkered brown: ccBb (non-checkered brown)\n- Checkered checkered: ccbb (non-checkered checkered)\n- Non-checkered red: Ccbb (red, non-checkered)\n- Non-checkered brown: ccBB (non-checkered brown)\n- Non-checkered checkered: ccBb (non-checkered, but B is recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has cc (recessive for C) and B (dominant), it's non-checkered brown. Similarly, cc (recessive for B) and B (dominant) is non-checkered checkered. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CcBb (both dominant)\n- Checkered brown: ccBb (only B dominant)\n- Checkered checkered: ccbb (both recessive)\n- Non-checkered red: Ccbb (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Non-checkered brown: ccBB (B recessive)\n- Non-checkered checkered: ccBb (B recessive, but C is recessive?)\n\nWait, no. The term \"checkered\" refers to having at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C present (for pigment) and B present (for body) \u2192 CcBb\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 ccBb\n- Checkered checkered: C absent, B absent \u2192 ccbb\n- Non-checkered red: C absent, B present \u2192 Ccbb\n- Non-checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 ccBB\n- Non-checkered checkered: C absent, B present \u2192 ccBb (Wait, no\u2014ccBb would mean C is recessive and B is dominant. Is that considered checkered? Yes.)\n\nWait, but this changes the phenotypic categories. Now, the checkered category includes all birds with at least one dominant allele for both traits. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B present \u2192 CcBb\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 ccBb\n- Checkered checkered: C absent, B absent \u2192 ccbb\n- Non-checkered red: C absent, B present \u2192 Ccbb\n- Non-checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 ccBB\n- Non-checkered checkered: C absent, B present \u2192 ccBb\n\nWait, but ccBb would have C absent and B present, so it's non-checkered and brown, whereas ccBB is C present and B absent, so it's non-checkered and red. Similarly, ccbb is both C and B absent, so it's non-checkered and checkered.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CcBb \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: ccBb \u2192 50%\n- Checkered checkered: ccbb \u2192 25%\n- Non-checkered red: Ccbb \u2192 25%\n- Non-checkered brown: ccBB \u2192 25%\n- Non-checkered checkered: ccBb \u2192 25%\n\nAdding these together, 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 175, which exceeds 16. This indicates a miscalculation. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes should be categorized based on both traits. Let me list them clearly:\n\n1. Checkered red: CcBb\n2. Checkered brown: ccBb\n3. Checkered checkered: ccbb\n4. Non-checkered red: Ccbb\n5. Non-checkered brown: ccBB\n6. Non-checkered checkered: ccBb\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype in the F2 generation are:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% ccBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 Checkered checkered\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 Non-checkered red\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 Non-checkered brown\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Non-checkered checkered\n\nSumming these gives 175%, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 50%\n- Checkered checkered: 25%\n- Non-checkered red: 25%\n- Non-checkered brown: 25%\n- Non-checkered checkered: 25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 150%, which is wrong. I must have miscounted. Let me",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options sum to 16, so they are consistent with the 16 parts. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in F2. Let me verify the calculations again. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F1 can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one gamete, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are 25% CcBb, 50% Ccbb, and 25% ccbb.\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 50%\n- Phenotype D: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25 : 50 : 25, which simplifies to 1 : 2 : 1. But looking at the options, none directly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me recount. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 both dominant traits present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Ccbb \u2192 only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 neither present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these has a certain frequency in the population. The frequency of each genotype is 25%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. Now, for each phenotype, we need to count how many times each appears in terms of the number of birds with that phenotype. Since each bird has two traits, the number of birds with a particular phenotype is determined by the number of individuals who exhibit those traits. \n\nFor example, in the F2 generation, the number of birds with both traits (Phenotype A) would be 25% of the total, Phenotype B (only C) would be 50%, and Phenotype D (none) would be 25%.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided:\n\nOption E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16, which aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but why does Option E have 3,9,1,3 instead of 25,50,25,25? Because the options are scaled. Perhaps the scale factor is such that each part represents 1 bird, so Phenotype A is 9, B is 3, C is 1, D is 3. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. The F2 generation consists of 25% CcBb, 50% Ccbb, and 25% ccbb. Each of these corresponds to Phenotypes A, B, and D. The number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds with those genotypes. Assuming a large population, the distribution is roughly 25% A, 50% B, and 25% D. But since the options provide integer values, we need to scale these percentages to whole numbers. 25% is approx 1, 50% is 2, and 25% is 1. So the ratio would be 1:2:1:2, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is 16, making each percentage correspond to 16 birds. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n- Phenotype B: 50% of 16 = 8 birds\n- Phenotype D: 25% of 16 = 4 birds\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified, rounding to the nearest multiple. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nIf the ratio is 1:2:1:2, then the closest would be option E, which is 3:9:1:3, but that scales by 3, making it 9:27:3:9, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the scaling factor is 16, leading to 4:8:4:4, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the original question expects us to ignore dominance and treat each trait independently, leading to a different outcome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The options suggest ratios like 6:2:6:2, which add up to 16. This suggests that the phenotypic ratio is 6,2,6,2 across the four phenotypes. Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, the phenotypes are based on both genes, resulting in a 1:2:1:2 ratio, which would correspond to 4:8:4:4 if scaled up by 4. But none of the options match that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each gene's effect is considered separately without accounting for the other, leading to a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem treats each gene independently, meaning that for each bird, the chance of having pigment red is 1 (since C is dominant), and brown is 1 (since B is dominant). Therefore, all birds would have both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that contradicts the options, as the ratios don't reflect equal representation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the phenotypic ratio based on the dominance of each gene, treating each trait independently.\n\nIn that case, for each bird, the probability of having pigment red is 1 (since C is dominant), and the probability of having brown is 1 (since B is dominant). Therefore, every bird would have both traits, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, this isn't reflected in the options, which all have varying ratios.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of both dominant alleles, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since the options don't include this, I must reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers each gene's effect separately, ignoring the interaction. So, for pigment color, the presence of C results in red, and the presence of B results in brown. But since both genes are required for a particular phenotype, the presence of either dominant allele allows that trait. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:2:1:2, which would translate to 4:8:4:4 if scaled up by 4. But this still doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16, which fits the total number of birds. This suggests that the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is a classic Mendelian ratio. How did that happen?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is treating each trait independently, so the checkered color (which requires both genes to be recessive) occurs in 1/4 of the cases, while the others occur in 3/4. So, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/4 (only C and B present) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 1/4 (C present, B absent) \u2192 1 part\n- Plain red: 1/4 (C absent, B present) \u2192 1 part\n- Plain brown: 1/4 (neither present) \u2192 1 part\n\nBut this sums to 4 parts, not 16. Alternatively, if the scale factor is 16, each part becomes 4 birds. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 4\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nWhich totals 16 birds. But this doesn't match the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats each trait as a separate event, leading to the ratio 3:9:1:3, which is the typical 1:3:3:1 pattern for two independent genes when counting the occurrences of each genotype. However, this is for diploid organisms where each trait is influenced by one gene, but in this case, both genes influence the same trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, treating each gene's effect independently. For pigment color, the presence of C makes it red, and for body color, the presence of B makes it brown. The checkered appearance (cB) occurs when both genes are recessive. The phenotypic ratios can be thought of as:\n\n- Red and Brown: Both C and B present \u2192 1/4 of the time\n- Red and Checkered: C present, B absent \u2192 1/4\n- Checkered and Brown: C absent, B present \u2192 1/4\n- Checkered and Checkered: Neither present \u2192 1/4\n\nThis gives a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, if each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't reflect this, so I must conclude that I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nPerhaps the problem is asking for the ratio in terms of the number of checkered vs non-checkered, or vice versa. Let me recast the problem: the F2 generation has the following phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: checkered (cB) and red (RR, BB) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Checkered brown: checkered (cB) and brown (rr, bb) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain red: red (RR, BB) and brown (rr, bb) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain checkered: checkered (cB) and red (RR, BB) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are based on the combination of the genes. Since the F2 generation is 25% CcBb, 50% Ccbb, and 25% ccbb, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Checkered red): 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- Phenotype 2 (Checkered brown): 25% of 50% = 12.5%\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain red): 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain checkered): 50% of 25% = 12.5%\n\nBut none of the options match these exact percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting an approximate whole number ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number. 6.25 is approximately 6, 12.5 is approximately 13, etc. But that doesn't align with the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy, where the presence of a dominant allele overrides the recessive one. But that's already accounted for in the Punnett squares.\n\nWait, going back to the initial Punnett square analysis, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing it. Let me try again.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nF1: Cc Bb (all possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, CC, cc, BB, bb?) Wait, no\u2014each parent can only produce one type of gamete due to dominance. Wait, no\u2014because both parents are homozygous, they will produce only one type of gamete each. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes CB. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes cb. Therefore, the F1 will be Cc Bb, and it will produce only one type of gamete, CB, from each parent. Thus, the F2 will only have the genotype Cc Bb, which combines with itself to produce 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% ccbb. Now, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- ccbb: Checkered checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1, but scaled appropriately. However, since the options don't reflect this, I must consider that the problem is referring to the number of checkered versus non-checkered within each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy in a different manner. For instance, if the presence of dominant alleles leads to the expression of the other trait. But that complicates things further.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem is using a different definition of checkered. Checkered typically refers to having both parents' alleles, i.e., cc BB or cc bb. In this case, the F2 would have:\n\n- CcBb: Checkered (since C and B are dominant)\n- ccBb: Non-checkered (since c is recessive for C)\n- ccbb: Checkered (since c is recessive for B)\n- Ccbb: Non-checkered (since B is recessive for B)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CcBb (red and brown)\n- Checkered brown: ccBb (non-checkered brown)\n- Checkered checkered: ccbb (non-checkered checkered)\n- Non-checkered red: Ccbb (red, non-checkered)\n- Non-checkered brown: ccBB (non-checkered brown)\n- Non-checkered checkered: ccBb (non-checkered, but B is recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has cc (recessive for C) and B (dominant), it's non-checkered brown. Similarly, cc (recessive for B) and B (dominant) is non-checkered checkered. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CcBb (both dominant)\n- Checkered brown: ccBb (only B dominant)\n- Checkered checkered: ccbb (both recessive)\n- Non-checkered red: Ccbb (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Non-checkered brown: ccBB (B recessive)\n- Non-checkered checkered: ccBb (B recessive, but C is recessive?)\n\nWait, no. The term \"checkered\" refers to having at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C present (for pigment) and B present (for body) \u2192 CcBb\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 ccBb\n- Checkered checkered: C absent, B absent \u2192 ccbb\n- Non-checkered red: C absent, B present \u2192 Ccbb\n- Non-checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 ccBB\n- Non-checkered checkered: C absent, B present \u2192 ccBb (Wait, no\u2014ccBb would mean C is recessive and B is dominant. Is that considered checkered? Yes.)\n\nWait, but this changes the phenotypic categories. Now, the checkered category includes all birds with at least one dominant allele for both traits. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B present \u2192 CcBb\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 ccBb\n- Checkered checkered: C absent, B absent \u2192 ccbb\n- Non-checkered red: C absent, B present \u2192 Ccbb\n- Non-checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 ccBB\n- Non-checkered checkered: C absent, B present \u2192 ccBb\n\nWait, but ccBb would have C absent and B present, so it's non-checkered and brown, whereas ccBB is C present and B absent, so it's non-checkered and red. Similarly, ccbb is both C and B absent, so it's non-checkered and checkered.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CcBb \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: ccBb \u2192 50%\n- Checkered checkered: ccbb \u2192 25%\n- Non-checkered red: Ccbb \u2192 25%\n- Non-checkered brown: ccBB \u2192 25%\n- Non-checkered checkered: ccBb \u2192 25%\n\nAdding these together, 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 175, which exceeds 16. This indicates a miscalculation. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes should be categorized based on both traits. Let me list them clearly:\n\n1. Checkered red: CcBb\n2. Checkered brown: ccBb\n3. Checkered checkered: ccbb\n4. Non-checkered red: Ccbb\n5. Non-checkered brown: ccBB\n6. Non-checkered checkered: ccBb\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype in the F2 generation are:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% ccBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 Checkered checkered\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 Non-checkered red\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 Non-checkered brown\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Non-checkered checkered\n\nSumming these gives 175%, which is impossible. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 50%\n- Checkered checkered: 25%\n- Non-checkered red: 25%\n- Non-checkered brown: 25%\n- Non-checkered checkered: 25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 150%, which is wrong. I must have miscounted. Let me",

    "chunk_removed": "F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options have a sum of 16. So all options represent the same distribution, scaled differently. But looking at the options, each option presents the count for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. From our analysis, the counts should be 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), 1 (D). But let's look at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation exactly.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. Hmm, but looking at the options, the user labeled them as A through H, but the answer choices are also presented as multiple-choice letters, probably referring to the number of each phenotype.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain red) 1, Phenotype B (red checkered) 3, Phenotype A (red brown) 9, Phenotype D (plain brown) 3. Wait, no\u2014the numbers correspond to the counts: 1 (plain red), 3 (red checkered), 9 (red brown), 3 (plain brown). Yes, that's exactly what option E states. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options have a total of 16.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. Let me double-check. Wait, in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options add up to 16, which is consistent with our calculations. Now, looking at the question, it asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the count. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our analysis, the order is checkered red (Phenotype D), checkered brown (Phenotype B), plain red (Phenotype C), plain brown (Phenotype A). So the ratio would be plain brown : plain red : checkered brown : checkered red, which is 1:3:3:9. Wait, but in terms of the options, option E lists checkered red first, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. Which aligns with the order 1:3:3:9, but written as plain brown first. Hmm, perhaps I got confused. Let me clarify: According to our earlier breakdown:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits present \u2192 plain brown and red \u2192 ratio 1\n- Phenotype B: only C \u2192 checkered red \u2192 ratio 3\n- Phenotype C: only B \u2192 plain red \u2192 ratio 3\n- Phenotype D: neither \u2192 checkered brown \u2192 ratio 9\n\nSo the order in the options is:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1 \u2192 checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 1:3:9:3 \u2192 plain brown, plain red, checkered brown, checkered red\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown\n\nFrom our analysis, the correct order is checkered red (1), checkered brown (9), plain red (3), plain brown (3). So that matches option C. But wait, let me double-check. The question asks for phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't seem right because according to our analysis, it's 1:9:3:3. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me go back. The phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Both C and B: red and brown \u2192 Ratio 9 parts\n- Only C: checkered red \u2192 3 parts\n- Only B: plain red \u2192 3 parts\n- Neither: checkered brown \u2192 1 part\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So checking the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which fits. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

That fits our calculation because Checkered red corresponds to Phenotype A (red and brown) and Checkered brown is Phenotype B (red and checkered). But in option C, it's written as \"Checkered red 9\" followed by \"checkered brown 3\", which aligns with our calculation. The rest are 3 and 1, which correspond to plain red and plain brown. So option C matches the ratio 9:3:3:1, but in the order of Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown.\n\nHowever, looking back, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Which also sums to 16.

Therefore, unless the options list the phenotypes differently, but given the way the options are presented, option C is 9:3:3:1, matching the correct ratio.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options add up to 16. Hmm, but according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is equivalent to 9:3:3:1 if reversed. Wait, but the order matters. Option E lists checkered red (phenotype D?), checkered brown (phenotype B?), plain red (phenotype C?), plain brown (phenotype A?). Wait, let me clarify. According to our earlier breakdown:\n\nPhenotype A: red and brown (9/16)\nPhenotype B: red and checkered (3/16)\nPhenotype C: plain and brown (3/16)\nPhenotype D: plain and checkered (1/16)\n\nSo the order in the options is:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our 9:3:3:1, but the order is different. Our order is A:D:B:C, while option C is A:D:B:C. Wait, no. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 So Checkered red is 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That fits our calculation because Checkered red corresponds to Phenotype A (red and brown) and Checkered brown is Phenotype B (red and checkered). But in option C, it's written as \"Checkered red 9\" followed by \"checkered brown 3\", which aligns with our calculation. The rest are 3 and 1, which correspond to plain red and plain brown. So option C matches the ratio 9:3:3:1, but in the order of Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown.\n\nHowever, looking back, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Which also sums to 16. But it's the reverse of our calculation. So why is this happening?\n\nAh, because in option E, the order is Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown, which is exactly the opposite of what our calculation shows. Our calculation was 9:3:3:1, whereas option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Therefore, unless the options list the phenotypes differently, but given the way the options are presented, option C is 9:3:3:1, matching the correct ratio.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

That corresponds to option E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no, option E is 3,9,1,3. Option C is 9,3,3,1. So depending on how the phenotypes are counted. From our earlier analysis, Phenotype A (both traits) is 9, B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. So the ratio is A:B:C:D = 9:3:3:1. Which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. That corresponds to option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Because in the options, option C lists checkered red as 9, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, plain brown as 1. Yes, that matches.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "All add up to 16.",
    "rollout": " All add up to 16. But looking at the options, option E has 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to our calculations. Option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns with Phenotype C (plain red) as 1 part, Phenotype B (checkered brown) as 9 parts, Phenotype D (plain brown) as 3 parts, and Phenotype A (red and brown) as 3 parts. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, Phenotype C should be 1 part, Phenotype B (only C) should be 3 parts, Phenotype D (neither) should be 1 part, and Phenotype A (both) should be 9 parts. But according to the options, option E lists checkered red as 3, which would correspond to Phenotype B, and plain brown as 9, which is Phenotype A. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me double-check. According to the rules:\n\n- Checkered (c) and plain (C) for pigment\n- Brown (b) and checkered (B) for color\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these. Therefore:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and plain (C): checkered red\n2. Checkered (c) and brown (b): checkered brown\n3. Plain (C) and brown (b): plain brown\n4. Plain (C) and checkered (B): plain red\n\nNow, based on the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype C (only c, no C) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B (no c, but C present) \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain red: Phenotype D (no c, no C) \u2192 1 part\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (no c, but b present) \u2192 9 parts\n\nThus, the counts would be:\n\nCheckered red: 1\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain red: 1\nPlain brown: 9\n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Wait, option E is: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). That doesn't align with our probabilities. Our probabilities suggest checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 1, and plain brown is 9. None of the options seem to fit perfectly. Perhaps I misapplied the rules. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\n- Only C: checkered red\n- Only B: checkered brown\n- Neither: plain\n- Both: plain brown\n\nThen, the counts would be:\n\nOnly C: 3\nOnly B: 3\nNeither:1\nBoth:9\n\nWhich would correspond to option E: 3,9,1,3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because \"only C\" refers to having C present without B, and \"only B\" refers to B present without C. So the counts would indeed be 3,9,1,3. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. But looking at the options, option E has 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to our calculations. Option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns with Phenotype C (plain red) as 1 part, Phenotype B (checkered brown) as 9 parts, Phenotype D (plain brown) as 3 parts, and Phenotype A (red and brown) as 3 parts. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, Phenotype C should be 1 part, Phenotype B (only C) should be 3 parts, Phenotype D (neither) should be 1 part, and Phenotype A (both) should be 9 parts. But according to the options, option E lists checkered red as 3, which would correspond to Phenotype B, and plain brown as 9, which is Phenotype A. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me double-check. According to the rules:\n\n- Checkered (c) and plain (C) for pigment\n- Brown (b) and checkered (B) for color\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these. Therefore:\n\n1. Checkered (c) and plain (C): checkered red\n2. Checkered (c) and brown (b): checkered brown\n3. Plain (C) and brown (b): plain brown\n4. Plain (C) and checkered (B): plain red\n\nNow, based on the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype C (only c, no C) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B (no c, but C present) \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain red: Phenotype D (no c, no C) \u2192 1 part\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (no c, but b present) \u2192 9 parts\n\nThus, the counts would be:\n\nCheckered red: 1\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain red: 1\nPlain brown: 9\n\nLooking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Wait, option E is: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). That doesn't align with our probabilities. Our probabilities suggest checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 1, and plain brown is 9. None of the options seem to fit perfectly. Perhaps I misapplied the rules. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\n- Only C: checkered red\n- Only B: checkered brown\n- Neither: plain\n- Both: plain brown\n\nThen, the counts would be:\n\nOnly C: 3\nOnly B: 3\nNeither:1\nBoth:9\n\nWhich would correspond to option E: 3,9,1,3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because \"only C\" refers to having C present without B, and \"only B\" refers to B present without C. So the counts would indeed be 3,9,1,3. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Wait, according to our earlier breakdown, 'plain red' refers to the bird having c (for C) and b (for B)? No, wait, 'plain' is when both genes are recessive. So 'plain red' would be c (from c) and B (from B?), but no\u2014wait, 'plain' corresponds to both recessive alleles, i.e., c and b. So:\n\n- 'Checkered red': C present, b absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n- 'Checkered brown': c present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 'Plain red': c present, b present \u2192 Phenotype D\n- 'Plain brown': C present, b present \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles for each gene. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene determines the trait. So:\n\n- If C is present (dominant, red) and B is present (dominant, brown): Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- If C is present (red) but B is absent (checkered): Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- If C is absent (plain) but B is present (brown): Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- If both C and B are absent (checkered): Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: C present AND B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present AND B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent AND B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, in terms of the number of offspring (assuming N=16):\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nLooking at the options, that matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014because 'checkered red' is Phenotype B (C present, b absent), which is 3. 'Checkered brown' is Phenotype C (c present, B present), which is also 3. But in the options, option E lists 'checkered brown' as 9. That contradicts my previous reasoning. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the names. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, according to my calculations, the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype B \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C \u2192 3\n- Plain red: Phenotype D \u21921\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A\u21929\n\nWhich matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which aligns with what I got. Wait, no: my counts were:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype B \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C \u21923\n- Plain red: Phenotype D \u21921\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A \u21929\n\nSo the correct counts are 9,3,1,3. Which matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014it's the opposite. My counts are:\n\n- checkered red: 3\n- checkered brown:3\n- plain red:1\n- plain brown:9\n\nBut option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which would mean I've misassigned the names. Perhaps the options are labeled differently. Wait, looking back, the options are:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich would correspond to:\n\n- checkered red:9\n- checkered brown:3\n- plain red:3\n- plain brown:1\n\nBut according to my analysis, checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 3, plain red is1, plain brown is9. So none of the options match exactly unless I'm misunderstanding the phenotype names. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the names in the options are reversed. Let me read them again:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nFrom my analysis, the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered red:3\n- Checkered brown:3\n- Plain red:1\n- Plain brown:9\n\nThis corresponds to option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Option C lists checkered red as9, checkered brown as3, which conflicts with my counts. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing a Punnett square again.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. So the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can only produce gametes for each gene separately. So for the C gene: half the gametes are CB (dominant), half are cb (recessive). For the B gene: half are BB (dominant), half are Bb (dominant). Since the genes are independent, the F2 will have combinations of these. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n          | C c | B b\n        CG | C C B B\n        cg | C c B B\n        cg | C c B b\n        cg | C c B b\n\nWait, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities. Since each gene is independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each gene, the possible alleles are C (prob 3/4), c (1/4); B (3/4), b (1/4).\n\nThus, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C: 3/4 C, 1/4 c\nFor B: 3/4 B, 1/4 b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- P(C present) = 3/4\n- P(B present) = 3/4\n- P(both present) = (3/4)(3/4) =9/16\n- P(C present, B absent) = (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- P(c present, B present) = (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- P(neither present) = (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Both present: red and brown (A) \u21929/16\n- Only C: red and checkered (B) \u21923/16\n- Only B: plain and brown (C) \u21923/16\n- Neither: plain and checkered (D) \u21921/16\n\nSo in terms of counts (assuming N=16):\n\n- A:9\n- B:3\n- C:3\n- D:1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:A,3:B,3:C,1:D.\n\nLooking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F L.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F M.1,1,1,1 \u2192 sum 4 N.etc.\n\nSo the correct answer based on our calculations is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Because:\n\nPhenotype A (both traits): 9/16 \u2192 3 if N=16\nPhenotype B (only C): 3/16 \u2192 3\nPhenotype C (only B): 3/16 \u2192 3\nPhenotype D (neither): 1/16 \u21921\n\nWait, but looking back, the options have 'plain red' and 'plain brown'. Wait, according to our earlier breakdown, 'plain red' refers to the bird having c (for C) and b (for B)? No, wait, 'plain' is when both genes are recessive. So 'plain red' would be c (from c) and B (from B?), but no\u2014wait, 'plain' corresponds to both recessive alleles, i.e., c and b. So:\n\n- 'Checkered red': C present, b absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n- 'Checkered brown': c present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 'Plain red': c present, b present \u2192 Phenotype D\n- 'Plain brown': C present, b present \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles for each gene. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene determines the trait. So:\n\n- If C is present (dominant, red) and B is present (dominant, brown): Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- If C is present (red) but B is absent (checkered): Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- If C is absent (plain) but B is present (brown): Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- If both C and B are absent (checkered): Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: C present AND B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present AND B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent AND B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, in terms of the number of offspring (assuming N=16):\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nLooking at the options, that matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014because 'checkered red' is Phenotype B (C present, b absent), which is 3. 'Checkered brown' is Phenotype C (c present, B present), which is also 3. But in the options, option E lists 'checkered brown' as 9. That contradicts my previous reasoning. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the names. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, according to my calculations, the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype B \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C \u2192 3\n- Plain red: Phenotype D \u21921\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A\u21929\n\nWhich matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which aligns with what I got. Wait, no: my counts were:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype B \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C \u21923\n- Plain red: Phenotype D \u21921\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A \u21929\n\nSo the correct counts are 9,3,1,3. Which matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014it's the opposite. My counts are:\n\n- checkered red: 3\n- checkered brown:3\n- plain red:1\n- plain brown:9\n\nBut option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which would mean I've misassigned the names. Perhaps the options are labeled differently. Wait, looking back, the options are:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich would correspond to:\n\n- checkered red:9\n- checkered brown:3\n- plain red:3\n- plain brown:1\n\nBut according to my analysis, checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 3, plain red is1, plain brown is9. So none of the options match exactly unless I'm misunderstanding the phenotype names. Alternatively, perhaps the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the names in the options are reversed. Let me read them again:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nFrom my analysis, the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered red:3\n- Checkered brown:3\n- Plain red:1\n- Plain brown:9\n\nThis corresponds to option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Option C lists checkered red as9, checkered brown as3, which conflicts with my counts. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing a Punnett square again.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. So the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can only produce gametes for each gene separately. So for the C gene: half the gametes are CB (dominant), half are cb (recessive). For the B gene: half are BB (dominant), half are Bb (dominant). Since the genes are independent, the F2 will have combinations of these. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n          | C c | B b\n        CG | C C B B\n        cg | C c B B\n        cg | C c B b\n        cg | C c B b\n\nWait, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities. Since each gene is independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each gene, the possible alleles are C (prob 3/4), c (1/4); B (3/4), b (1/4).\n\nThus, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C: 3/4 C, 1/4 c\nFor B: 3/4 B, 1/4 b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- P(C present) = 3/4\n- P(B present) = 3/4\n- P(both present) = (3/4)(3/4) =9/16\n- P(C present, B absent) = (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- P(c present, B present) = (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- P(neither present) = (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- Both present: red and brown (A) \u21929/16\n- Only C: red and checkered (B) \u21923/16\n- Only B: plain and brown (C) \u21923/16\n- Neither: plain and checkered (D) \u21921/16\n\nSo in terms of counts (assuming N=16):\n\n- A:9\n- B:3\n- C:3\n- D:1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:A,3:B,3:C,1:D.\n\nLooking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's exactly what I have. So option C is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 L.6,2,6,2 M.8,4,0,4 N.9,3,3,1 O.1,3,9,3 P.3,9,1,3 Q.4,4,4,4 R.12,2,2,0 S.5,3,2,6 T.7,5,1,3 U.2,6,3,1 V.4,4,4,4 W.1,3,9,3 X.3,9,1,3 Y.2,6,3,1 Z.4,4,4,4\n\nSo looking at the options, option E has 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. This matches our calculation where Phenotype A is 9, B is 3, C is 3, and D is 1. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But in terms of counts, if N is the total number of offspring, then Phenotype A:9N, B:3N, C:3N, D:N.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

    "rollout": " So all options sum to 16, but the actual count depends on the number of offspring. However, without knowing the exact number, we have to rely on the proportions. The correct ratio should reflect that 9 have both traits, 3 have only C, 3 have only B, and 1 has neither. So looking at the options, option E has 3,9,1,3\u2014which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain red), Phenotype B (red brown?), wait no\u2014the labels are:\n\nWait, the options list the phenotypes as:\n\nA.

Red brown (C and b)\n3. Plain brown (c and B)\n4. Plain red (C and b)\n\nWait, but this contradicts our previous conclusion. Perhaps I'm mixing up the traits. Let me clarify: The two traits are pigment color (C) and body color (B). Pigment color is determined by C (red) or c (plain). Body color is determined by B (brown) or b (checkered).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 So all options sum to 16, but the actual count depends on the number of offspring. However, without knowing the exact number, we have to rely on the proportions. The correct ratio should reflect that 9 have both traits, 3 have only C, 3 have only B, and 1 has neither. So looking at the options, option E has 3,9,1,3\u2014which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain red), Phenotype B (red brown?), wait no\u2014the labels are:\n\nWait, the options list the phenotypes as:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

Which matches option C: 9,3,3,1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because according to our calculations, the phenotypes are:\n\n- 9 birds with both traits (plain red)\n- 3 birds with only C (red brown)\n- 3 birds with only B (brown)\n- 1 bird with neither (checkered)\n\nSo the order in the options is:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 plain red, red brown, plain brown, checkered\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2013 checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2013 plain red, red brown, plain brown, checkered\n\nOur analysis shows that plain red is 9, red brown is 3, plain brown is 1, and checkered is 1.

Wait, no\u2014the phenotypic ratios are based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the correct order is:\n\nPlain red (c and b), red brown (C and b), plain brown (c and B), checkered (C and b). Wait, no\u2014the presence of C and B determines the color, while the presence of c and b determines the other trait. So the correct phenotypic order is:\n\n1. Checkered (c and b)\n2. Red brown (C and b)\n3. Plain brown (c and B)\n4. Plain red (C and b)\n\nWait, but this contradicts our previous conclusion. Perhaps I'm mixing up the traits. Let me clarify: The two traits are pigment color (C) and body color (B). Pigment color is determined by C (red) or c (plain). Body color is determined by B (brown) or b (checkered). So the phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and checkered (C and b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: 1/16\n\nThus, the correct order in terms of phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n\n2. Red brown (C and b) \u2192 3/16\n\n3. Plain brown (c and B) \u2192 3/16\n\n4. Plain red (C and B) \u2192 9/16\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the options.

Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, perhaps the options are mislabeled, but based on our calculations, the correct ratio is 9 (plain red), 3 (red brown), 3 (plain brown), 1 (checkered). This corresponds to option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, no\u2014the checkered red would be when both traits are present, which is 9/16, but the options may be listing the phenotypes in a different order. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the phenotypes in the order of dominant traits, but I think my initial analysis is correct.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 So all options sum to 16. But according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9, B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. So the correct order is Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1. Which corresponds to option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no, that's reversed. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Our calculation shows checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. So the correct option is E, but in reverse order. Wait, no, looking back, the options are labeled with the order:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo according to our calculation, option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which is exactly what option C states. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 So all options sum to 16. But in terms of the number of birds with each phenotype, according to our calculation, the distribution should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking at the options, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Our calculation said checkered red would be 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which matches option C. But in reality, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is what option C represents. However, looking back at the initial question, the options presented may have different scaling factors. For instance, option E mentions 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc. That would imply a ratio of 3:9:3:1, which is equivalent to 1:3:3:1 when scaled. Wait, but in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. So among the options provided, option C states the ratio as 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the counts should be 9,3,3,1. Which corresponds to option C. But wait, looking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That also adds up to 16, matching our previous counts. Wait, but according to our analysis, the count for checkered red should be 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. So option C would have checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc. So depending on which phenotype comes first, the order matters. In our analysis, the order was checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So option C would have those values. But looking at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

However, the options provided include E as well. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown (let's call this PB)\n2. Only C present (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered (PC)\n3. Only B present (C absent) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown (PB_B)\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (PC_bb)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of a dominant allele is 3/4, and recessive is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- PB: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- PC: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- PB_B: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- PC_bb: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse order. But in terms of the options presented, both C and E have similar patterns but reversed. However, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, so the order matters. If the options list them in the same order as the phenotypes, then option C is correct. However, looking back, the options provided are labeled A through J, and the answer choices are letters from A to H. Wait, the original question lists options A through H, each with a specific ratio. From the earlier analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But let me double-check the question to ensure I didn't mix up the order.\n\nThe question states: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". None of the options seem to match 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the options were misrepresented. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance rules. Perhaps the recessive allele is not always expressed unless present. Wait, but in standard genetics, a dominant allele is sufficient to express the trait, while the recessive allele is needed to mask it. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it expresses that trait. Therefore, the previous analysis holds. So the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, matching option C. However, looking at the options provided, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse. Perhaps the question expects the ratio in a different order. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nLooking at option E, the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is equivalent to 3:9:1:3, whereas our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. These are reverses of each other. So perhaps the order of the phenotypes is different in the options. If the phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, then the ratio would be 9:6:3:2, which doesn't match any option. Alternatively, if the phenotypes are listed in a different order, perhaps the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the order of the phenotypes in the options. Let me recount the phenotypes:\n\n1. Both traits present (Red and Brown) \u2192 9 parts\n2. Only C present (Red and Checkered) \u2192 3 parts\n3. Only B present (Plain and Brown) \u2192 3 parts\n4. Neither present (Plain and Checkered) \u2192 1 part\n\nIf the options are listing these in a different order, such as checkered red (which would correspond to 9 parts), plain red (which would be 6 parts?), checkered brown (3 parts), plain brown (2 parts), that wouldn't align with any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not in the order of the phenotypes but just numbers assigned arbitrarily.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, none of the options match this exactly. Wait, looking at the options again, option G is 12:2:2:2, which is a different ratio altogether. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which doesn't match. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is all 4s. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our desired ratio. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is similar but starts with 1 instead of 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dominance hierarchy. Wait, the problem statement says: red is C, brown is B. So, a bird with at least one C is red, and a bird with at least one B is brown. So, a bird with both is red and brown, a bird with only C is red and checkered, a bird with only B is plain and brown, and a bird with neither is plain and checkered.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 So all options add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16. Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, the correct distribution should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, the options provided include E as well. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown (let's call this PB)\n2. Only C present (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered (PC)\n3. Only B present (C absent) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown (PB_B)\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (PC_bb)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of a dominant allele is 3/4, and recessive is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- PB: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- PC: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- PB_B: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- PC_bb: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse order. But in terms of the options presented, both C and E have similar patterns but reversed. However, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, so the order matters. If the options list them in the same order as the phenotypes, then option C is correct. However, looking back, the options provided are labeled A through J, and the answer choices are letters from A to H. Wait, the original question lists options A through H, each with a specific ratio. From the earlier analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But let me double-check the question to ensure I didn't mix up the order.\n\nThe question states: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". None of the options seem to match 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the options were misrepresented. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance rules. Perhaps the recessive allele is not always expressed unless present. Wait, but in standard genetics, a dominant allele is sufficient to express the trait, while the recessive allele is needed to mask it. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it expresses that trait. Therefore, the previous analysis holds. So the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, matching option C. However, looking at the options provided, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse. Perhaps the question expects the ratio in a different order. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nLooking at option E, the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is equivalent to 3:9:1:3, whereas our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. These are reverses of each other. So perhaps the order of the phenotypes is different in the options. If the phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, then the ratio would be 9:6:3:2, which doesn't match any option. Alternatively, if the phenotypes are listed in a different order, perhaps the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the order of the phenotypes in the options. Let me recount the phenotypes:\n\n1. Both traits present (Red and Brown) \u2192 9 parts\n2. Only C present (Red and Checkered) \u2192 3 parts\n3. Only B present (Plain and Brown) \u2192 3 parts\n4. Neither present (Plain and Checkered) \u2192 1 part\n\nIf the options are listing these in a different order, such as checkered red (which would correspond to 9 parts), plain red (which would be 6 parts?), checkered brown (3 parts), plain brown (2 parts), that wouldn't align with any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not in the order of the phenotypes but just numbers assigned arbitrarily.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, none of the options match this exactly. Wait, looking at the options again, option G is 12:2:2:2, which is a different ratio altogether. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which doesn't match. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is all 4s. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our desired ratio. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is similar but starts with 1 instead of 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dominance hierarchy. Wait, the problem statement says: red is C, brown is B. So, a bird with at least one C is red, and a bird with at least one B is brown. So, a bird with both is red and brown, a bird with only C is red and checkered, a bird with only B is plain and brown, and a bird with neither is plain and checkered. So our initial analysis was correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. Unless the options are mislabeled, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the dominant gene C; plain color is checked by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant for pigment color, and c is recessive. Similarly, B is dominant for color, and b is recessive. The adiabolic cross involves a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. Wait, but the F2 generation comes from the F1 cross, which itself comes from the dihybrid cross of CC BB and cc bb. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dihybrid cross. Let me reconsider: The dihybrid cross is between CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. So the F2 would be the squares I constructed before. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. So despite the options including E as 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse, the correct answer should be option C. However, since the options are labeled A to H, and the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C, I think that is the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele).

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.

Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 So all options sum to 16, which aligns with our calculation. But looking at the options, they represent the ratio, not the absolute count. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Option C states \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" But according to our calculations, the checkered red is Phenotype C (plain red), which is 9 parts, checkered brown is Phenotype B (only C), which is 3 parts. Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are:\n\nWait, hold on, I might have mixed up the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A: both traits present \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered bird, red color, brown body.\n\nPhenotype B: only C \u2192 red, plain body.\n\nPhenotype C: only B \u2192 plain, brown body.\n\nPhenotype D: neither \u2192 plain, checkered body.\n\nSo, in terms of the options:\n\nOption C says: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nThat would correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype A (9 parts)\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B (3 parts)\n- Plain red: Phenotype C (3 parts)\n- Plain brown: Phenotype D (1 part)\n\nYes, that matches. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16, so the relative counts matter. So the order is:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 parts\n- Checkered brown: 9 parts\n- Plain red: 1 part\n- Plain brown: 3 parts\n\nWhich corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F L.6,2,6,2 same as A M.8,4,0,4 same as B N.9,3,3,1 same as C O.3,9,1,3 same as E P.4,4,4,4 same as F Q.12,2,2,0 same as G R.5,3,2,6 same as H S.7,5,1,3 same as I T.\n\nSo, according to our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Because in a sample of 16 birds, 9 are checkered red (phenotype C), 3 are checkered brown (phenotype B), 3 are plain red (phenotype D), and 1 is plain brown (phenotype A).

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Now, looking at the phenotypic ratios presented:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, checkered red (D) is 1, checkered brown (B) is 3, plain red (C) is 3, and plain brown (A) is9.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "All add up to 16.",
    "rollout": " All add up to 16. Wait, but the options list the ratios, not the absolute counts. So for example, option A says checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 6:2:6:2. That would correspond to 6/16 for A, 2/16 for B, etc. But looking at the options, the answer choices are presented as ratios, not percentages. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Because 9+3+3+1=16, and each fraction represents the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total. So option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. Wait, but the options list the ratios, not the absolute counts. So for example, option A says checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 6:2:6:2. That would correspond to 6/16 for A, 2/16 for B, etc. But looking at the options, the answer choices are presented as ratios, not percentages. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Because 9+3+3+1=16, and each fraction represents the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total. So option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Which corresponds to Phenotypes D, C, A, B respectively, with counts 1,3,9,3 scaled by a factor of 16. But in reality, each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio is usually presented as the count of each distinct phenotype. However, sometimes people group similar phenotypes together. In this case, the options seem to list the counts for each phenotype separately. But according to our calculations, the counts should be 9,3,3,1 for Phenotypes A, B, C, D respectively. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which aligns with Phenotypes D, C, A, B with counts 3,9,1,3. But according to our analysis, the correct counts should be 9,3,3,1. However, the options don't have exactly that. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, but our sum is 16. Perhaps the options are scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the original question expects the answer without scaling, expecting the ratio of each phenotype type. But the correct ratio according to our calculation is 9:3:3:1, which is option J. But looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the inverse of what we have. Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises from the direction of the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the order in the options is different.

Wait, no\u2014if Phenotype D is plain red (phenotype 4), Phenotype C is plain brown (phenotype 3), Phenotype A is red and brown (phenotype 1), and Phenotype B is red and checkered (phenotype 2).

So E is matching our results. So the correct answer would be E. However, looking back at the options provided, option E indeed lists the counts as 3,9,1,3, which correspond to Phenotypes D, C, A, B respectively.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.

Which corresponds to Phenotypes D, C, A, B respectively, with counts 1,3,9,3 scaled by a factor of 16. But in reality, each bird has two traits, so the phenotypic ratio is usually presented as the count of each distinct phenotype. However, sometimes people group similar phenotypes together. In this case, the options seem to list the counts for each phenotype separately. But according to our calculations, the counts should be 9,3,3,1 for Phenotypes A, B, C, D respectively. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which aligns with Phenotypes D, C, A, B with counts 3,9,1,3. But according to our analysis, the correct counts should be 9,3,3,1. However, the options don't have exactly that. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, but our sum is 16. Perhaps the options are scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the original question expects the answer without scaling, expecting the ratio of each phenotype type. But the correct ratio according to our calculation is 9:3:3:1, which is option J. But looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the inverse of what we have. Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises from the direction of the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the order in the options is different. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at the user-provided options:\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 (Phenotype D)\n- Checkered brown: 9 (Phenotype C)\n- Plain red:1 (Phenotype A)\n- Plain brown:3 (Phenotype B)\n\nThis matches our previous conclusion that Phenotype D (plain red) is 3, Phenotype C (plain brown) is 9, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 3, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 9. Wait, no, that doesn't align. Wait, no\u2014if Phenotype D is plain red (phenotype 4), Phenotype C is plain brown (phenotype 3), Phenotype A is red and brown (phenotype 1), and Phenotype B is red and checkered (phenotype 2). According to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, and Phenotype D is 1. But the options list E as:\n\nCheckered red (D):3\nCheckered brown (C):9\nPlain red (A):1\nPlain brown (B):3\n\nWhich would mean:\n\nD:3 (plain red)\nC:9 (plain brown)\nA:1 (red and brown)\nB:3 (red and checkered)\n\nBut according to our analysis, A should be 9 and B should be 3. So E is matching our results. So the correct answer would be E. However, looking back at the options provided, option E indeed lists the counts as 3,9,1,3, which correspond to Phenotypes D, C, A, B respectively. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:9:1:3, which is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which is exactly the same as 9:3:3:1, but reversed. Because checkered red corresponds to Phenotype B, which is only C present, and checkered brown is Phenotype C, only B present. So the correct ratio should be: Checkered red (B) : Checkered brown (C) : Plain red (D) : Plain brown (A) \u2192 3 : 3 : 1 : 9. But the options list checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which conflicts with our analysis. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are ordered differently. Maybe:\n\n1. Checkered red (both traits present)\n2. Checkered brown (only B)\n3. Plain red (only C)\n4. Plain brown (none)\n\nIn that case, the ratio would be 1:3:3:9, which would correspond to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Yes, that matches. So the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options have a total of 16, but scaled differently. Hmm, perhaps the user meant that each part represents the count in a certain order, but without knowing the exact scaling, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled, but looking back, the correct phenotypic ratio based on the calculations is Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1 \u2192 which corresponds to option E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, checkered red (A) is 9, checkered brown (B) is 3, plain red (C) is 1, plain brown (D) is 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "All options sum to 16.",
    "rollout": " All options sum to 16. Hmm, but looking back, the correct phenotypic ratio according to our analysis should be 9:3:3:1. But in the options, each option presents four numbers adding to 16. So, for example, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our analysis, checkered red (which would correspond to phenotype C, plain brown) is 1 part, while plain red (phenotype A) is 9 parts. So perhaps the options are labeled incorrectly. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.

Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nIn our analysis, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So in terms of order, checkered red (Phenotype A) : checkered brown (Phenotype B) : plain red (Phenotype C) : plain brown (Phenotype D) = 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2013 which corresponds to checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This fits our ratio.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2013 which would be checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This also fits, but depending on how the traits are ordered.\nWait, but in our analysis, checkered red is the highest, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. Option C follows this order exactly. Option E reverses the last two.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options sum to 16. Hmm, but looking back, the correct phenotypic ratio according to our analysis should be 9:3:3:1. But in the options, each option presents four numbers adding to 16. So, for example, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our analysis, checkered red (which would correspond to phenotype C, plain brown) is 1 part, while plain red (phenotype A) is 9 parts. So perhaps the options are labeled incorrectly. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nIn our analysis, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So in terms of order, checkered red (Phenotype A) : checkered brown (Phenotype B) : plain red (Phenotype C) : plain brown (Phenotype D) = 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2013 which corresponds to checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This fits our ratio.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2013 which would be checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This also fits, but depending on how the traits are ordered.\nWait, but in our analysis, checkered red is the highest, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. Option C follows this order exactly. Option E reverses the last two.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

The correct order in the answer should reflect the correct phenotypic classes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nWait, none of the options have a sum of 16, but the counts add up to 16 in each. So looking at the options:\n\nOption C says 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\n\nOption E says 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo the actual phenotypic distribution is 9 (phenotype A) : 3 (phenotype B) : 3 (phenotype C) : 1 (phenotype D)\n\nLooking at the options, option E is \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\" which corresponds to Phenotype C, Phenotype B, Phenotype D, Phenotype A respectively. Option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which would correspond to Phenotype A:9, Phenotype B:3, Phenotype C:3, Phenotype D:1. So the order matters. The correct order in the answer should reflect the correct phenotypic classes. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically lists the phenotypes in the order of the letters A, B, C, D, corresponding to red-brown vs plain-checkered. So the correct order is:\n\n- Checkered red (A) : 9\n- Checkered brown (B) : 3\n- Plain red (C) : 3\n- Plain brown (D) : 1\n\nWhich matches option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nAlternatively, if the options list the phenotypes in the order A, B, C, D, then the correct option is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Option E is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which matches our calculation: 9:3:3:1, but grouped as checkered (B) and plain (c). So option E groups the phenotypes as plain and checkered (B) versus plain and red (c). So the correct answer would be option E. Let me double-check. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options sum to 16.

Wait, but the options seem to group the phenotypes differently. Option E is 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which matches our calculation: 9:3:3:1, but grouped as checkered (B) and plain (c). So option E groups the phenotypes as plain and checkered (B) versus plain and red (c). So the correct answer would be option E. Let me double-check. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the correct ratio is 9 checkered red (which is the same as plain brown?), 3 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 1 plain plain. Wait, no\u2014actually, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: This refers to the bird being plain (c) and red (C).

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb).

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. This matches option C.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 So all options sum to 16. Now, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, I realize that I may have made a mistake. Because in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, but the presence of each dominant allele determines the trait. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. This matches option C. But wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in F2, which includes both red and brown within each phenotype category. So the actual counts would be:\n\nCheckered red: 9\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain red: 3\nPlain brown: 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Option E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3, which is a different distribution. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me double-check. For each bird, the probability of having both C and B dominant is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options provided do not include this exact ratio. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which is close but arranged differently. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is also close but reversed. Wait, perhaps I've confused the order. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C is correct. However, in the initial analysis, I thought that the correct ratio was 9:3:3:1, which is what option C states.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same.\n\nSo the correct distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the options, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't add up to 16. Wait, did I miscount?\n\nWait, according to my earlier analysis, the probabilities should be:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (none): 1/16\n\nIf we assume 16 birds, then:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nBut the options don't exactly list this. Option E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3, which is a different distribution. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me double-check. For each bird, the probability of having both C and B dominant is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options provided do not include this exact ratio. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which is close but arranged differently. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is also close but reversed. Wait, perhaps I've confused the order. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C is correct. However, in the initial analysis, I thought that the correct ratio was 9:3:3:1, which is what option C states. Therefore, the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 So all options have a total of 16. But looking at the options, they are scaled up. For example, option A shows 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., but according to our calculations, the numbers should be 9,3,3,1. Option E is exactly that. So the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Wait, looking back at the original question: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". It doesn't specify the number of offspring, but often in genetic problems, unless stated otherwise, the ratio is assumed to be 16. However, the options don't have 16 as the sum.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nWait, none of the options have a sum of 16. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of individuals in each category without scaling, implying that the numbers add up to a certain value. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled by a factor, such as counting 16 individuals, making each choice represent 1 individual. Wait, looking back at the original question: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". It doesn't specify the number of offspring, but often in genetic problems, unless stated otherwise, the ratio is assumed to be 16. However, the options don't have 16 as the sum. Wait, looking at option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. Yes, that matches. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. Now, looking at the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype A: Checkered red \u2192 count 9\nPhenotype B: Checkered brown \u2192 count 3\nPhenotype C: Plain red \u2192 count 1\nPhenotype D: Plain brown \u2192 count 3\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:1:3. Which corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Because Option E lists Phenotype A as checkered red with count 3, B as checkered brown with 9, C as plain red with 1, D as plain brown with 3. Yes, that matches.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F L.6,3,1,6 \u2192 sum 16 M.9,3,3,1 \u2192 same as C N.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 O.7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as I P.

AA.1,3,9,3 \u2192 same as D\n\nSo looking at our calculations, the correct distribution is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, which corresponds to option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no, according to our earlier calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown): 9/16, which translates to 9 in a population of 16, but the options seem to have scaled differently. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong because the F2 generation includes both parents producing gametes. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, which is the F1 (CcBb) producing gametes (CB, cb, cb, CB). But when I constructed the Punnett square, I considered the F2 as resulting from F1 \u00d7 F1, which would indeed have the probabilities as calculated above. However, the options presented seem to suggest a different scaling. Perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I need to double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering the interference between the two genes. Wait, but in reality, the genes are independent, so interference shouldn't affect the outcome. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which aligns with option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Yes, that makes sense.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 L.12,2,2,0 M.5,3,2,6 N.7,5,1,3 O.4,4,4,4 P.6,2,6,2 Q.8,4,0,4 R.9,3,3,1 S.12,2,2,0 T.5,3,2,6 U.7,5,1,3 V.3,9,1,3 W.4,4,4,4 X.12,2,2,0 Y.5,3,2,6 Z.7,5,1,3\n\nSo according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

But according to our calculation, Phenotype A is red and brown (9 parts), Phenotype B is checkered and brown (3 parts), Phenotype C is plain and brown (1 part), and Phenotype D is plain and checkered (3 parts).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

But none of the options exactly match this. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would mean checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which doesn't align with our earlier calculation where checkered red was 9 and checkered brown was 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me re-examine the possible phenotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the possible genotypes after F2 are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc (wait, no\u2014each F1 is CcBb, so F2 would produce gametes with each gene independently segregating.)\nWait, no\u2014each gene is segregating independently. So for each gene, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each F1 is CcBb, so for each gene, the segregation is:\n\nFor C: 50% C, 50% c\n\nFor B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each with a certain probability. For each gene, the probability of presence is independent. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. Only C present (not B) \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. Only B present (not C) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present. This occurs when C is present (prob 3/4) AND B is present (prob 3/4). So probability is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present. This happens when C is present and B is not. Probability is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: Only B present. Probability is (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither present. Probability is (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is A:B:C:D = 9:3:3:1\n\nLooking at the options, option F says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to checkered red (which would be Phenotype A: 9), checkered brown (Phenotype B: 3), plain red (Phenotype C: 3), plain brown (Phenotype D:1). So the order would be 9:3:3:1. But the options list them differently. Option E lists 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match our calculation. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). None of the options exactly match this. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the options.\n\nWait, let me look again at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nOur correct ratio is 9:3:3:1 \u2192 checkered red: checkered brown: plain red: plain brown = 9:3:3:1, which is option F: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. My correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1).\n\nBut none of the options seem to list this exactly. Let's see:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which is swapped from what we have.\n\nOption F: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\nIn my analysis, checkered red is when both C and B are present \u2192 9/16.\n\nCheckered brown is when only C is present \u2192 3/16.\n\nPlain red is when only B is present \u2192 3/16.\n\nPlain brown is when neither is present \u2192 1/16.\n\nSo the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, only option F and E mention similar ratios.\n\nOption F: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 reversed checkered red and checkered brown.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 same as F.\n\nWait, that doesn't help. Let me see if any option combines these ratios correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculations. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach gene is segregating independently, so for each gene:\n\nProbability of C present: 3/4 (since any C allele gives red)\n\nProbability of B present: 3/4 (since any B allele gives brown)\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nRed and Brown (A): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nRed and Checkered (B): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain and Brown (C): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain and Checkered (D): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3 \u2192 checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which is swapped.\n\nOption F: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the names. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (when both C and B are present) \u2192 9/16\n\n- Checkered brown (only C present) \u2192 3/16\n\n- Plain red (only B present) \u2192 3/16\n\n- Plain brown (neither C nor B) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly state this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 L.6,3,2,3 \u2192 sum 14 M.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 N.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 O.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 P.6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 Q.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 R.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 S.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 T.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 U.6,3,2,3 \u2192 sum 14 V.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 W.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 X.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 Y.6,3,2,3 \u2192 sum 14 Z.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 AA.6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 AB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 AC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 AD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 AE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 AF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 AG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 AH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 AI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 AJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 AK.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 AL.6,3,2,3 \u2192 sum 14 AM.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 AN.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 AO.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 AP.6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 AQ.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 AR.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 AS.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 AT.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 AU.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 AV.6,3,2,3 \u2192 sum 14 AW.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 AX.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 AY.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 AZ.6,3,2,3 \u2192 sum 14 BA.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 BB.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 BC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 BD.

But none of the options exactly match this. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would mean checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which doesn't align with our earlier calculation where checkered red was 9 and checkered brown was 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me re-examine the possible phenotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square, the possible genotypes after F2 are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Cc (wait, no\u2014each F1 is CcBb, so F2 would produce gametes with each gene independently segregating.)\nWait, no\u2014each gene is segregating independently. So for each gene, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each F1 is CcBb, so for each gene, the segregation is:\n\nFor C: 50% C, 50% c\n\nFor B: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each with a certain probability. For each gene, the probability of presence is independent. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. Only C present (not B) \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. Only B present (not C) \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present. This occurs when C is present (prob 3/4) AND B is present (prob 3/4). So probability is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present. This happens when C is present and B is not. Probability is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: Only B present. Probability is (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither present. Probability is (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is A:B:C:D = 9:3:3:1\n\nLooking at the options, option F says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to checkered red (which would be Phenotype A: 9), checkered brown (Phenotype B: 3), plain red (Phenotype C: 3), plain brown (Phenotype D:1). So the order would be 9:3:3:1. But the options list them differently. Option E lists 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match our calculation. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). None of the options exactly match this. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the options.\n\nWait, let me look again at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nOur correct ratio is 9:3:3:1 \u2192 checkered red: checkered brown: plain red: plain brown = 9:3:3:1, which is option F: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. My correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1).\n\nBut none of the options seem to list this exactly. Let's see:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which is swapped from what we have.\n\nOption F: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\nIn my analysis, checkered red is when both C and B are present \u2192 9/16.\n\nCheckered brown is when only C is present \u2192 3/16.\n\nPlain red is when only B is present \u2192 3/16.\n\nPlain brown is when neither is present \u2192 1/16.\n\nSo the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, only option F and E mention similar ratios.\n\nOption F: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 reversed checkered red and checkered brown.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 same as F.\n\nWait, that doesn't help. Let me see if any option combines these ratios correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculations. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach gene is segregating independently, so for each gene:\n\nProbability of C present: 3/4 (since any C allele gives red)\n\nProbability of B present: 3/4 (since any B allele gives brown)\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nRed and Brown (A): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nRed and Checkered (B): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain and Brown (C): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain and Checkered (D): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3 \u2192 checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which is swapped.\n\nOption F: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the names. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (when both C and B are present) \u2192 9/16\n\n- Checkered brown (only C present) \u2192 3/16\n\n- Plain red (only B present) \u2192 3/16\n\n- Plain brown (neither C nor B) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly state this. However, option F is listed as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which is the reverse of our desired ratio.\n\nOption E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as F.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe I have the order wrong. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which is same as F.\n\nOption F: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 same as E.\n\nWait, perhaps the order in the options is such that the first entry is checkered red, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown.\n\nYes, in the options, the first value is checkered red, second checkered brown",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "All options have a total of 16.",
    "rollout": " All options have a total of 16. So each option represents the count in terms of N=16.

Phenotype B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. So looking at the options, option E matches exactly: 3,9,1,3. So the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options have a total of 16. So each option represents the count in terms of N=16. So for example, option E would mean 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. But according to our calculations, Phenotype A is 9/16, which is 9 in N=16. Phenotype B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. So looking at the options, option E matches exactly: 3,9,1,3. So the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "All options sum to 16.",
    "rollout": " All options sum to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios. Because the options seem to suggest different distributions. Let me double-check. Another approach: For each bird, the chance of having both traits (red and brown) is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only red (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only brown (no C) is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown. This corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, option E is \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\" which also sums to 16, matching the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is equivalent to 9:3:3:1 when reversed. Wait, no\u2014if the ratio is 9:3:3:1, it's checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which is the reverse order. So depending on how the options define the order, option E might represent the same ratio but inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the roles of C and B. Wait, in the problem statement, C determines pigment color, and B determines body color. So, a bird with C present is red, and a bird with B present is brown. So, the phenotype ratios would correspond to:\n\n- Both C and B present: red and brown (let's call this checkered red and plain brown)\n- C present, B absent: red and plain\n- C absent, B present: plain and brown\n- Neither C nor B: plain and plain\n\nSo, in terms of the options, the first option (A) states checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Again, not matching.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, this fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This reverses the ratio, which may not be the case.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This also reverses the order, but still fits the 3:9:1:3 ratio.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because both C and E seem to fit. Let me clarify. Our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nWhich corresponds to option C. However, the options also include option E, which is the reverse, but both E and C sum to 16. So why does the problem ask for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation? Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Based on our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean option C is correct. But looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nAll sum to 16, so the correct ratio is either C or E. Now, let me compare with standard Mendelian ratios. The F2 generation typically shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So, the correct answer should reflect this. However, the problem mentions that the bird's coat color and pigmentation are influenced by the genes, but the options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which aligns with our understanding. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (which we can denote as checkered red and plain brown)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 red and plain (checkered red and plain brown)\nWait no\u2014hold on. The problem defines:\n\n- Red color is controlled by C\n- Brown color is controlled by B\n\nSo, a bird with C present is red, and a bird with B present is brown. Therefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red (from C) and brown (from B) \u2192 let's call this \"checkered red\" and \"plain brown\"\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and plain \u2192 \"checkered red\" and \"plain brown\"\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 \"plain red\" and \"plain brown\"\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and plain \u2192 \"plain red\" and \"plain brown\"\n\nWait, this seems conflicting because the same phenotype name (\"plain brown\") appears multiple times, which is confusing. But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits simultaneously. So, for example, a bird with C and B will have both traits expressed, while a bird without either will have neither. Therefore, the correct phenotypic classes should be:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 \"red-brown\" (or simply \"red and brown\")\n- C present, B absent \u2192 \"red and plain\"\n- C absent, B present \u2192 \"plain and brown\"\n- Neither C nor B present \u2192 \"plain and plain\"\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the probabilities of having both traits, one trait, or none. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options sum to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios. Because the options seem to suggest different distributions. Let me double-check. Another approach: For each bird, the chance of having both traits (red and brown) is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only red (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only brown (no C) is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown. This corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, option E is \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\" which also sums to 16, matching the 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is equivalent to 9:3:3:1 when reversed. Wait, no\u2014if the ratio is 9:3:3:1, it's checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which is the reverse order. So depending on how the options define the order, option E might represent the same ratio but inverted. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the roles of C and B. Wait, in the problem statement, C determines pigment color, and B determines body color. So, a bird with C present is red, and a bird with B present is brown. So, the phenotype ratios would correspond to:\n\n- Both C and B present: red and brown (let's call this checkered red and plain brown)\n- C present, B absent: red and plain\n- C absent, B present: plain and brown\n- Neither C nor B: plain and plain\n\nSo, in terms of the options, the first option (A) states checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Again, not matching.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, this fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This reverses the ratio, which may not be the case.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This also reverses the order, but still fits the 3:9:1:3 ratio.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because both C and E seem to fit. Let me clarify. Our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nWhich corresponds to option C. However, the options also include option E, which is the reverse, but both E and C sum to 16. So why does the problem ask for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation? Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Based on our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean option C is correct. But looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nAll sum to 16, so the correct ratio is either C or E. Now, let me compare with standard Mendelian ratios. The F2 generation typically shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So, the correct answer should reflect this. However, the problem mentions that the bird's coat color and pigmentation are influenced by the genes, but the options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which aligns with our understanding. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. Therefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (which we can denote as checkered red and plain brown)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 red and plain (checkered red and plain brown)\nWait no\u2014hold on. The problem defines:\n\n- Red color is controlled by C\n- Brown color is controlled by B\n\nSo, a bird with C present is red, and a bird with B present is brown. Therefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red (from C) and brown (from B) \u2192 let's call this \"checkered red\" and \"plain brown\"\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and plain \u2192 \"checkered red\" and \"plain brown\"\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 \"plain red\" and \"plain brown\"\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and plain \u2192 \"plain red\" and \"plain brown\"\n\nWait, this seems conflicting because the same phenotype name (\"plain brown\") appears multiple times, which is confusing. But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits simultaneously. So, for example, a bird with C and B will have both traits expressed, while a bird without either will have neither. Therefore, the correct phenotypic classes should be:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 \"red-brown\" (or simply \"red and brown\")\n- C present, B absent \u2192 \"red and plain\"\n- C absent, B present \u2192 \"plain and brown\"\n- Neither C nor B present \u2192 \"plain and plain\"\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the probabilities of having both traits, one trait, or none. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 L.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 M.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 N.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 O.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 P.4,4,4,4 Q.6,2,6,2 R.8,4,0,4 S.12,2,2,0 T.5,3,2,6 U.7,5,1,3 V.3,9,1,3 W.4,4,4,4 X.12,2,2,0 Y.5,3,2,6 Z.7,5,1,3\n\nWait, all options sum to 16, which matches the total number of offspring in F2. But looking back, the F2 generation according to our calculations should have 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Which corresponds to option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But wait, no\u2014the pheno types correspond to the order in the options. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would mean:\n\nPhenotype A (both traits present): 3\nPhenotype B (only C): 9\nPhenotype C (only B): 1\nPhenotype D (neither): 3\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\nCheckered red (only B present): 9\n\nCheckered brown (only C present): 3\n\nPlain red (only C present): 1\n\nPlain brown (none present): 3\n\nWhich matches option E.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

But looking back, the options provided include several others. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which is exactly 1:3:3:9, matching our calculation if we take 9 as checkered red, 3 as checkered brown, etc. Wait, no\u2014the options are labeled as A to J, with each option having a certain distribution. For instance, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 3+9+1+3=16, which matches our earlier fraction. But according to our analysis, the actual phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option G. However, none of the options seem to have 9:3:3:1. Instead, option E has 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the way the phenotypes are counted is reversed. Let me re-examine the phenotypic classes:\n\nPhenotype A: Checkered red (cB present)\nPhenotype B: Checkered brown (cb present)\nPhenotype C: Plain red (Cc present)\nPhenotype D: Plain brown (bb present)\n\nIn our earlier analysis, the probabilities were:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options presented do not list this exact ratio. Instead, option E lists 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we have. This suggests that the question might be asking about the ratio in terms of the order of the phenotypes. Perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio starting with the most common phenotype, which is checkered red (A) with 9 parts, followed by checkered brown (B) with 3 parts, then plain red (C) with 3 parts, and finally plain brown (D) with 1 part. But this still doesn't match the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each type in the F2 generation without considering dominance, leading to a different ratio. For instance, considering that each bird has two traits, and the presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait being expressed, but without accounting for the fact that a bird could have both traits, which might lead to overlapping. However, I'm getting confused now. Let me try to look at the options again. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. According to our analysis, the checkered red (A) should have the highest frequency, which is 9, followed by checkered brown (B) at 3, plain red (C) at 3, and plain brown (D) at 1. However, option E has the checkered brown at 9 and plain red at 1, which contradicts our earlier conclusion. So perhaps the correct answer is option E, but that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Another possibility is that the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2, but the initial setup was about F2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the number of each phenotype in the F1 generation, but the question specifically asks for F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user is miscalculating the phenotypic ratio, thinking that each gene's contribution doubles the phenotypic possibilities, leading to 4 phenotypes instead of 16. But that can't be right because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't necessarily affect the other. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to note that the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. However, since none of the options list this exactly, perhaps the closest is option E, which aligns with the assumption that the phenotypes are ordered differently. Alternatively, the user may have mixed up the order of the phenotypes, leading to option E being correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in the F1 generation, but the question clearly states F2. Given the options provided, and after careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option E, which corresponds to 3:9:1:3, matching the ratio of the F1 generation in terms of dominance, but that doesn't align with our previous analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 generation, which would yield a different ratio. However, since the question specifies F2, I must proceed accordingly. Given that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options as listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, suggesting that the user considered the F1 ratio instead of F2. However, this is conflicting with the question's instructions.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nWait, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. But looking back, the options provided include several others. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which is exactly 1:3:3:9, matching our calculation if we take 9 as checkered red, 3 as checkered brown, etc. Wait, no\u2014the options are labeled as A to J, with each option having a certain distribution. For instance, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 3+9+1+3=16, which matches our earlier fraction. But according to our analysis, the actual phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option G. However, none of the options seem to have 9:3:3:1. Instead, option E has 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the way the phenotypes are counted is reversed. Let me re-examine the phenotypic classes:\n\nPhenotype A: Checkered red (cB present)\nPhenotype B: Checkered brown (cb present)\nPhenotype C: Plain red (Cc present)\nPhenotype D: Plain brown (bb present)\n\nIn our earlier analysis, the probabilities were:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options presented do not list this exact ratio. Instead, option E lists 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we have. This suggests that the question might be asking about the ratio in terms of the order of the phenotypes. Perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio starting with the most common phenotype, which is checkered red (A) with 9 parts, followed by checkered brown (B) with 3 parts, then plain red (C) with 3 parts, and finally plain brown (D) with 1 part. But this still doesn't match the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each type in the F2 generation without considering dominance, leading to a different ratio. For instance, considering that each bird has two traits, and the presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait being expressed, but without accounting for the fact that a bird could have both traits, which might lead to overlapping. However, I'm getting confused now. Let me try to look at the options again. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. According to our analysis, the checkered red (A) should have the highest frequency, which is 9, followed by checkered brown (B) at 3, plain red (C) at 3, and plain brown (D) at 1. However, option E has the checkered brown at 9 and plain red at 1, which contradicts our earlier conclusion. So perhaps the correct answer is option E, but that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Another possibility is that the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2, but the initial setup was about F2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the number of each phenotype in the F1 generation, but the question specifically asks for F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user is miscalculating the phenotypic ratio, thinking that each gene's contribution doubles the phenotypic possibilities, leading to 4 phenotypes instead of 16. But that can't be right because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't necessarily affect the other. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to note that the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. However, since none of the options list this exactly, perhaps the closest is option E, which aligns with the assumption that the phenotypes are ordered differently. Alternatively, the user may have mixed up the order of the phenotypes, leading to option E being correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype in the F1 generation, but the question clearly states F2. Given the options provided, and after careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option E, which corresponds to 3:9:1:3, matching the ratio of the F1 generation in terms of dominance, but that doesn't align with our previous analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the F1 generation, which would yield a different ratio. However, since the question specifies F2, I must proceed accordingly. Given that, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options as listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, suggesting that the user considered the F1 ratio instead of F2. However, this is conflicting with the question's instructions.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

But wait, I thought the correct answer was option E, but according to this, option C is correct. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes. Let me double-check. In the original question, the colors are determined by B (brown) and b (checkered). So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one B allele (brown), it can be brown-red or brown-checkered.\n\nSimilarly, having at least one b allele (checkered) can be red or checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Has both B and b alleles \u2192 Brown and checkered (Phenotype C)\n\n2. Only B alleles \u2192 Brown and red (Phenotype B)\n\n3. Only b alleles \u2192 Checkered and red (Phenotype D)\n\n4. Neither B nor b alleles \u2192 Red and checkered (Phenotype A)\n\nWait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown, and if it has at least one b allele, it's checkered. So:\n\n- If it has B and b \u2192 Brown and checkered (Phenotype C)\n\n- If it has B and not b \u2192 Brown and red (Phenotype B)\n\n- If it has b and not B \u2192 Checkered and red (Phenotype D)\n\n- If it has neither B nor b \u2192 Red and checkered (Phenotype A)\n\nThus, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both B and b: 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n\n- Only B: 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n\n- Only b: 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\n- Neither: 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nBut in the options, none seem to list these exactly.

But in the initial analysis, I thought the correct answer was option E, but now I realize that perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option E. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A through J, with each having four values adding up to 16. Based on the calculation, option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits the 9/16, 3/16, etc. However, sometimes in problems, the order of phenotypes matters. The question specifies \"the phenotypic ratio,\" but it's unclear if the order is specified. However, typically, the order is checkedered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, in our previous breakdown, checkered red (A) was 1/16, checkered brown (B) was 3/16, plain red (C) was 3/16, and plain brown (D) was 9/16. So the ratio would be 1:3:3:9, which is option E.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. But looking at the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6+2+6+2=16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\n\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\n\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\n\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\n\nSo according to our calculation, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches. But wait, I thought the correct answer was option E, but according to this, option C is correct. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes. Let me double-check. In the original question, the colors are determined by B (brown) and b (checkered). So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one B allele (brown), it can be brown-red or brown-checkered.\n\nSimilarly, having at least one b allele (checkered) can be red or checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Has both B and b alleles \u2192 Brown and checkered (Phenotype C)\n\n2. Only B alleles \u2192 Brown and red (Phenotype B)\n\n3. Only b alleles \u2192 Checkered and red (Phenotype D)\n\n4. Neither B nor b alleles \u2192 Red and checkered (Phenotype A)\n\nWait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown, and if it has at least one b allele, it's checkered. So:\n\n- If it has B and b \u2192 Brown and checkered (Phenotype C)\n\n- If it has B and not b \u2192 Brown and red (Phenotype B)\n\n- If it has b and not B \u2192 Checkered and red (Phenotype D)\n\n- If it has neither B nor b \u2192 Red and checkered (Phenotype A)\n\nThus, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both B and b: 9/16 \u2192 Phenotype C\n\n- Only B: 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype B\n\n- Only b: 3/16 \u2192 Phenotype D\n\n- Neither: 1/16 \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nBut in the options, none seem to list these exactly. Wait, let me look at the options again. Option C says 9,3,3,1, which aligns with this. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But in the initial analysis, I thought the correct answer was option E, but now I realize that perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option E. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A through J, with each having four values adding up to 16. Based on the calculation, option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits the 9/16, 3/16, etc. However, sometimes in problems, the order of phenotypes matters. The question specifies \"the phenotypic ratio,\" but it's unclear if the order is specified. However, typically, the order is checkedered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, in our previous breakdown, checkered red (A) was 1/16, checkered brown (B) was 3/16, plain red (C) was 3/16, and plain brown (D) was 9/16. So the ratio would be 1:3:3:9, which is option E. Because option E lists checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (9), totaling 16. Therefore, the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Wait, no\u2014that's getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nThe checkered phenotype is when both c (recessive for C) and bb (recessive for B) are present. So, for the bird to be checkered, it must be cc (for C) and bb (for B).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options sum to 16, so that's consistent. Now, assigning which phenotype corresponds to which count. From above:\n\n- Phenotype A: checkered red (c and bb?) Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype comes from both c and bb. Wait, no, wait: the checkered phenotype is when c and bb are present, which would correspond to Phenotype D (neither C nor B). Wait, no\u2014that's getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nThe checkered phenotype is when both c (recessive for C) and bb (recessive for B) are present. So, for the bird to be checkered, it must be cc (for C) and bb (for B). So, Phenotype D: plain and checkered.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would be when C is present (i.e., C is dominant) but B is recessive (b is present). Wait, no\u2014if B is recessive, the bird is brown. So, checkered brown would mean c (C is recessive) and bb (B is recessive). Wait, that's the same as checkered. Hmm, I think I'm confusing terms. Let me re-express:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, according to the calculations:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo, in a population of 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 checkered red (A)\n- 3 checkered brown (B)\n- 3 plain brown (C)\n- 1 plain checkered (D)\n\nLooking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's matching exactly what I've got except for the order. Option E is:\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich aligns with Phenotype A (checkered red) = 3, B (checkered brown) =9, C (plain brown)=1, D (plain checkered)=3. Wait, no\u2014my earlier mapping was:\n\n- A: checkered red (c and bb) \u2192 9\n- B: checkered brown (c and B) \u2192 3\n- C: plain brown (cc and B) \u21923\n- D: plain checkered (cc and bb) \u21921\n\nBut looking at the options, option E lists:\n\nCheckered red 3 (which would be A)\nCheckered brown 9 (which would be B)\nPlain red 1 (which would be C)\nPlain brown 3 (which would be D)\n\nYes, that matches exactly. So the correct answer should reflect this distribution.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 L.3,3,1,3 \u2192 sum 10 M.2,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 8 N.1,1,1,1 \u2192 sum 4 O. Other... So, looking back, option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, matching our calculations. But wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which is typically presented in the order of the traits. The order of the phenotypes in the options varies. Option E lists checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our classification, checkered is plain, so 'plain red' would correspond to phenotype C (plain and brown), and 'plain brown' would be phenotype B (only C present). Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A: Checkered red (C and B present)\nPhenotype B: Checkered brown (only C present)\nPhenotype C: Plain red (only B present)\nPhenotype D: Plain brown (neither present)\n\nSo the order in the answer choices is:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 checkered red (A=3), checkered brown (B=9), plain red (C=1?), wait no\u2014no, according to our earlier mapping, checkered red is A, checkered brown is B, plain red is C, plain brown is D.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me re-express the phenotypic classes correctly. From earlier:\n\n- A: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n- B: Only C \u2192 Checkered brown\n- C: Only B \u2192 Plain red\n- D: Neither \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, in terms of the answer choices, which list the phenotypes in the order Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown, the sequence would be A, B, C, D. So checking the answer options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to:\n\nCheckered red (3),\nCheckered brown (9),\nPlain red (1),\nPlain brown (3).\n\nYes, that matches. So the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

But looking at the options, option E assigns checkered red as 3, which is 3 parts. Hmm, perhaps the scale factor is 16, making each part represent 1 bird.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So which one corresponds to the probabilities I've calculated? The probabilities are 9:3:3:1, which correspond to option E, which states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to my calculation, checkered red (phenotype D) is 1 part, which would translate to 1/16th of the population. But looking at the options, option E assigns checkered red as 3, which is 3 parts. Hmm, perhaps the scale factor is 16, making each part represent 1 bird. So if each part is 1 bird, then checkered red (D) is 1 bird, checkered brown (B) is 3 birds, plain red (A) is 9 birds, and plain brown (C) is 3 birds. That would mean option E is correct.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "All add up to 16.",
    "rollout": " All add up to 16. So depending on which phenotype corresponds to which count, the answer varies. Now, looking back at the question, the user wants the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. Based on our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Because according to our earlier breakdown, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits present \u2192 9/16\n2. Only C \u2192 3/16\n3. Only B \u2192 3/16\n4.

Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. Since C is dominant for pigment color, and B is dominant for body color, the presence of dominant alleles leads to those traits. So:\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 Pigment color: red (any C allele)\n- B is dominant \u2192 Body color: brown (any B allele)\n\nThus, a bird can have:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9/16\nPhenotype 2: 3/16\nPhenotype 3: 3/16\nPhenotype 4: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype 2): 3\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype 3): 3\n- Plain red (Phenotype 4): 1\n- Plain brown (Phenotype 1): 9\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nYes, that's exactly what we've got.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. So depending on which phenotype corresponds to which count, the answer varies. Now, looking back at the question, the user wants the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. Based on our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Because according to our earlier breakdown, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits present \u2192 9/16\n2. Only C \u2192 3/16\n3. Only B \u2192 3/16\n4. Neither \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red (only C): 3/16\n- Checkered brown (only B): 3/16\n- Plain red (neither): 1/16\n- Plain brown (both): 9/16\n\nWait, no\u2014the terminology may differ. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: only C present (plain and red)\n2. Checkered brown: only B present (plain and brown)\n3. Plain red: neither C nor B present (checkered and plain)\n4. Plain brown: both C and B present (checkered and brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's opposite of what I thought before. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. Since C is dominant for pigment color, and B is dominant for body color, the presence of dominant alleles leads to those traits. So:\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 Pigment color: red (any C allele)\n- B is dominant \u2192 Body color: brown (any B allele)\n\nThus, a bird can have:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and checkered (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype 1: 9/16\nPhenotype 2: 3/16\nPhenotype 3: 3/16\nPhenotype 4: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype 2): 3\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype 3): 3\n- Plain red (Phenotype 4): 1\n- Plain brown (Phenotype 1): 9\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nYes, that's exactly what we've got.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "All add up to 16.",
    "rollout": " All add up to 16. Wait, but looking at the options, each option lists four numbers adding to 16. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, specifically the order: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. From our calculations, the order should correspond to Phenotype D, C, A, B. Because:\n\n- Phenotype D: checkered and plain \u2192 1 part\n- Phenotype C: checkered and brown \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype A: red and brown \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: red and plain \u2192 3 parts\n\nSo the order would be D, C, A, B. Looking at the options, E says checkered red (D), checkered brown (C), plain red (A), plain brown (B). So E matches. But let me double-check.

However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. Wait, but looking at the options, each option lists four numbers adding to 16. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, specifically the order: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. From our calculations, the order should correspond to Phenotype D, C, A, B. Because:\n\n- Phenotype D: checkered and plain \u2192 1 part\n- Phenotype C: checkered and brown \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype A: red and brown \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: red and plain \u2192 3 parts\n\nSo the order would be D, C, A, B. Looking at the options, E says checkered red (D), checkered brown (C), plain red (A), plain brown (B). So E matches. But let me double-check. Alternatively, sometimes the order is based on the number of dominant traits, but the question specifies the order as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, which corresponds to D, C, A, B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

However, option E is 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not exactly matching. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. The probabilities were:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a sample size of 16, the counts would be 9,3,3,1 respectively. But the options don't have 9,3,3,1. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which would correspond to 3:9:1:3. Wait, that's similar to the 9:3:3:1 ratio but scaled down by a factor of 3. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Wait, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be expressed in terms of the number of birds for each phenotype, without necessarily reducing it. So, the 9:3:3:1 ratio would mean Phenotype A:9, Phenotype B:3, Phenotype C:3, Phenotype D:1. None of the options match exactly. Wait, looking at option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3. That would imply that the ratio is 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Each bird has two traits: pigment and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. The total number of possible phenotypic classes is 4 (as discussed before). The probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only Pigment red: 3/16\n- Only Pigment brown: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nNow, looking at the options, none directly represent 9:3:3:1, but option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3. This would correspond to Phenotype A:3, Phenotype B:9, Phenotype C:1, Phenotype D:3. Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A should be 9, Phenotype B:3, Phenotype C:3, Phenotype D:1. So option E is reversed, giving higher numbers to Phenotype B. That doesn't align with our calculations. Maybe I messed up the direction. Wait, perhaps the order is Pigment red first, Pigment brown next, Plain red last. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nWhich would correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown:9\n- Plain red:1\n- Plain brown:3\n\nThat would be the same as our 9:3:3:1 but in reverse order. Perhaps the user has incorrectly labeled the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I need to reconsider the dominance hierarchy. Wait, the user said Pigment red is dominant over checkered, and Brown is dominant over checkered. So, in terms of dominance, checkered is recessive to both Pigment and Brown. Pigment is dominant over checkered, and Brown is dominant over checkered. So, in a bird, if it has at least one Pigment allele, it is Pigment-colored. Similarly, if it has at least one Brown allele, it is Brown-colored. So, the presence of either Pigment or Brown allows the bird to express that trait, while checkered requires both. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: (Probability of Pigment) * (Probability of Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- Phenotype 2: (Probability of Pigment) * (Probability of Not Brown) = 1 * 0 = 0\n- Phenotype 3: (Probability of Not Pigment) * (Probability of Brown) = 0 * 1 = 0\n- Phenotype 4: (Probability of Not Pigment) * (Probability of Not Brown) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would suggest all birds have Pigment red, which contradicts the idea that Brown is also a trait. So I must have misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps Pigment is dominant over Checkered, and Brown is dominant over Checkered, but they are independent traits. So, a bird could have Pigment but not Brown, or Brown but not Pigment, or both. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is present. So, the probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\nFor Pigment red (P):\n\n- Probability of having at least one P allele: 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of cc)\n\nFor Brown (B):\n\n- Probability of having at least one B allele: 3/4\n\nSince the presence of P and B are independent, the combined probability for both traits is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only Pigment: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only Brown: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but ordered as Pigment-red and Brown, Pigment-red and Checkered, Plain-red and Brown, Plain-red and Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse. So perhaps the user intended the order as Pigment-red, Pigment-brown, Plain-red, Plain-brown, but the probabilities are 9,3,3,1. But in the options, E is 3,9,1,3, which may be due to a typo or mislabeling of the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the user used a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the number of genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me try recalculating using a different method. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\nEach parent contributes CcBb. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if the parent is CcBB, the gametes would be CB and cb. Similarly, the other parent is ccbb, so gametes are cb. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be generated by combining these gametes. \n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would look like this:\n\n          | Cc | Cc | cc | cc \n        -------------------\n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        cc      | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        cc      | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc \n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The correct Punnett square should show all possible combinations. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are CcBb and ccbb, then the gametes would be:\n\nFrom CcBb:\n- CB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n- cB (25%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nFrom ccbb:\n- cb (100%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are obtained by combining these gametes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb\n- From cB \u00d7 cb: ccBb\n- From bb \u00d7 cb: ccbb\n\nWait, that can't be right. Actually, the correct combination would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's still confusing. Alternatively, the Punnett square should list all possible combinations:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (each 25%). The other parent (ccbb) can produce only cb (100%). Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but this only accounts for four genotypes, but considering that cB and CB are distinct, the actual F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nWait, that can't be right because the cB and CB are distinct alleles. Actually, in the F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (not possible, since F1 is Cc)\n- Cc (possible)\n- cc (possible)\n\nSimilarly for B and b. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- Ccbb (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but that can't be because the parent was CcBb and ccbb, so the possible F2 genotypes should account for all combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 would include:\n\n- CcBb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- ccBb (from cB \u00d7 cb)\n- ccbb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no, that's incomplete. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb (each 25%), and F2 (ccbb) produces only cb, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n- ccbb (50%)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because each F2 should have 25% for each genotype. Wait, no\u2014there are four possible combinations: CB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 cb, cB \u00d7 cb, and cb \u00d7 cb. But cb is present only once, so the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccbb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nSo in total, 25% CcBb, 25% ccBb, and 50% ccbb. Now, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- C (dominant) means pigment red\n- B (dominant) means brown\n- c (recessive) means checkered\n- b (recessive) means brown\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb: Plain (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CcBb and ccBb share the same phenotype because they both have pigment red and brown.\n- The ccbb genotype has plain and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014the ccBb genotype has c (checkered) and B (brown), so Phenotype C. The CcBb genotype has C (red) and B (brown), so Phenotype A. The ccbb genotype has c (checkered) and b (brown), so Phenotype C.\n\nSo in the F2 population:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 50% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, that sums up to 100%, but according to this, Phenotype A is 25%, Phenotype C is 50%, which doesn't add up correctly because 25 + 50 = 75. I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) producing CB, cb, cB, cb, and F2 (ccbb) producing cb. So:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, that's four combinations, but in reality, the F2 should have four possible genotypes based on the parents. Let me correct this:\n\nThe correct Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n          | Cc | Cc | cc | cc \n        -------------------\n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        cc      | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        cc      | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc \n\nWait, no\u2014that's too complicated. Alternatively, each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. The F2 would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n- ccbb (50%)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, but that would mean Phenotype A (25%) and Phenotypes B and C (50%) each, which doesn't make sense because the phenotypes should reflect the presence of both traits. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, but that's three phenotypes, but according to the dominance hierarchy, all individuals with at least one Pigment (C) and at least one Brown (B) would have Pigment-red and Brown. Those with Pigment and no Brown (B) would have Pigment-red and plain. Those with no Pigment and Brown would have plain and Brown. Those with no Pigment and no Brown would have plain and plain. Wait, that doesn't fit the previous analysis. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red and Brown (C and B present)\nPhenotype B: Pigment red and plain (C and b present)\nPhenotype C: Plain and Brown (c and B present)\nPhenotype D: Plain and plain (c and b present)\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype B\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The F2 consists of four genotypes, each of which falls into one of the four phenotypes based on their presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nBecause:\n\n- CcBb: Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb: Has c and B \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb: Has c and b \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Ccbb: Has C and b \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 A\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 B\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 C\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 B\n\nWait, that can't be right because the F2 should have 100% accounted for. Let me count:\n\n- CcBb: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n- ccbb: 50%\n- Ccbb: 25%\n\nTotal: 100%.\n\nNow, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- A: 25%\n- B: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- C: 50%\n- D: 0%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25:A : 50:B : 50:C : 0:D \u2192 which simplifies to 1:A : 2:B : 2:C : 0:D. But that doesn't match any of the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscounted the phenotypes. Let me re-express:\n\n- A: 25%\n- B:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nSo according to our calculations, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, none directly match this. However, option E is 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not exactly matching. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. The probabilities were:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a sample size of 16, the counts would be 9,3,3,1 respectively. But the options don't have 9,3,3,1. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which would correspond to 3:9:1:3. Wait, that's similar to the 9:3:3:1 ratio but scaled down by a factor of 3. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Wait, perhaps the question expects the ratio to be expressed in terms of the number of birds for each phenotype, without necessarily reducing it. So, the 9:3:3:1 ratio would mean Phenotype A:9, Phenotype B:3, Phenotype C:3, Phenotype D:1. None of the options match exactly. Wait, looking at option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3. That would imply that the ratio is 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Each bird has two traits: pigment and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait. So for each bird, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. The total number of possible phenotypic classes is 4 (as discussed before). The probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only Pigment red: 3/16\n- Only Pigment brown: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nNow, looking at the options, none directly represent 9:3:3:1, but option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3. This would correspond to Phenotype A:3, Phenotype B:9, Phenotype C:1, Phenotype D:3. Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A should be 9, Phenotype B:3, Phenotype C:3, Phenotype D:1. So option E is reversed, giving higher numbers to Phenotype B. That doesn't align with our calculations. Maybe I messed up the direction. Wait, perhaps the order is Pigment red first, Pigment brown next, Plain red last. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nWhich would correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown:9\n- Plain red:1\n- Plain brown:3\n\nThat would be the same as our 9:3:3:1 but in reverse order. Perhaps the user has incorrectly labeled the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I need to reconsider the dominance hierarchy. Wait, the user said Pigment red is dominant over checkered, and Brown is dominant over checkered. So, in terms of dominance, checkered is recessive to both Pigment and Brown. Pigment is dominant over checkered, and Brown is dominant over checkered. So, in a bird, if it has at least one Pigment allele, it is Pigment-colored. Similarly, if it has at least one Brown allele, it is Brown-colored. So, the presence of either Pigment or Brown allows the bird to express that trait, while checkered requires both. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: (Probability of Pigment) * (Probability of Brown) = 1 * 1 = 1\n- Phenotype 2: (Probability of Pigment) * (Probability of Not Brown) = 1 * 0 = 0\n- Phenotype 3: (Probability of Not Pigment) * (Probability of Brown) = 0 * 1 = 0\n- Phenotype 4: (Probability of Not Pigment) * (Probability of Not Brown) = 0 * 0 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would suggest all birds have Pigment red, which contradicts the idea that Brown is also a trait. So I must have misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps Pigment is dominant over Checkered, and Brown is dominant over Checkered, but they are independent traits. So, a bird could have Pigment but not Brown, or Brown but not Pigment, or both. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is present. So, the probabilities are calculated as follows:\n\nFor Pigment red (P):\n\n- Probability of having at least one P allele: 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of cc)\n\nFor Brown (B):\n\n- Probability of having at least one B allele: 3/4\n\nSince the presence of P and B are independent, the combined probability for both traits is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only Pigment: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only Brown: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but ordered as Pigment-red and Brown, Pigment-red and Checkered, Plain-red and Brown, Plain-red and Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse. So perhaps the user intended the order as Pigment-red, Pigment-brown, Plain-red, Plain-brown, but the probabilities are 9,3,3,1. But in the options, E is 3,9,1,3, which may be due to a typo or mislabeling of the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the user used a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the number of genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me try recalculating using a different method. Using a Punnett square for F2:\n\nEach parent contributes CcBb. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if the parent is CcBB, the gametes would be CB and cb. Similarly, the other parent is ccbb, so gametes are cb. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be generated by combining these gametes. \n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would look like this:\n\n          | Cc | Cc | cc | cc \n        -------------------\n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        cc      | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        cc      | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc \n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The correct Punnett square should show all possible combinations. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are CcBb and ccbb, then the gametes would be:\n\nFrom CcBb:\n- CB (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n- cB (25%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nFrom ccbb:\n- cb (100%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are obtained by combining these gametes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb\n- From cB \u00d7 cb: ccBb\n- From bb \u00d7 cb: ccbb\n\nWait, that can't be right. Actually, the correct combination would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's still confusing. Alternatively, the Punnett square should list all possible combinations:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (each 25%). The other parent (ccbb) can produce only cb (100%). Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but this only accounts for four genotypes, but considering that cB and CB are distinct, the actual F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nWait, that can't be right because the cB and CB are distinct alleles. Actually, in the F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (not possible, since F1 is Cc)\n- Cc (possible)\n- cc (possible)\n\nSimilarly for B and b. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- Ccbb (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but that can't be because the parent was CcBb and ccbb, so the possible F2 genotypes should account for all combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 would include:\n\n- CcBb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- ccBb (from cB \u00d7 cb)\n- ccbb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no, that's incomplete. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb (each 25%), and F2 (ccbb) produces only cb, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n- ccbb (50%)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because each F2 should have 25% for each genotype. Wait, no\u2014there are four possible combinations: CB \u00d7 cb, cb \u00d7 cb, cB \u00d7 cb, and cb \u00d7 cb. But cb is present only once, so the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccbb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nSo in total, 25% CcBb, 25% ccBb, and 50% ccbb. Now, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- C (dominant) means pigment red\n- B (dominant) means brown\n- c (recessive) means checkered\n- b (recessive) means brown\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb: Plain (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CcBb and ccBb share the same phenotype because they both have pigment red and brown.\n- The ccbb genotype has plain and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014the ccBb genotype has c (checkered) and B (brown), so Phenotype C. The CcBb genotype has C (red) and B (brown), so Phenotype A. The ccbb genotype has c (checkered) and b (brown), so Phenotype C.\n\nSo in the F2 population:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 50% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, that sums up to 100%, but according to this, Phenotype A is 25%, Phenotype C is 50%, which doesn't add up correctly because 25 + 50 = 75. I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) producing CB, cb, cB, cb, and F2 (ccbb) producing cb. So:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, that's four combinations, but in reality, the F2 should have four possible genotypes based on the parents. Let me correct this:\n\nThe correct Punnett square for F2 would be:\n\n          | Cc | Cc | cc | cc \n        -------------------\n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        cc      | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc \n        cc      | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc | ccCc \n\nWait, no\u2014that's too complicated. Alternatively, each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. The F2 would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n- ccbb (50%)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, but that would mean Phenotype A (25%) and Phenotypes B and C (50%) each, which doesn't make sense because the phenotypes should reflect the presence of both traits. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, but that's three phenotypes, but according to the dominance hierarchy, all individuals with at least one Pigment (C) and at least one Brown (B) would have Pigment-red and Brown. Those with Pigment and no Brown (B) would have Pigment-red and plain. Those with no Pigment and Brown would have plain and Brown. Those with no Pigment and no Brown would have plain and plain. Wait, that doesn't fit the previous analysis. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A: Pigment red and Brown (C and B present)\nPhenotype B: Pigment red and plain (C and b present)\nPhenotype C: Plain and Brown (c and B present)\nPhenotype D: Plain and plain (c and b present)\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype B\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The F2 consists of four genotypes, each of which falls into one of the four phenotypes based on their presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nBecause:\n\n- CcBb: Has C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccBb: Has c and B \u2192 Phenotype B\n- ccbb: Has c and b \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Ccbb: Has C and b \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 A\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 B\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 C\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 B\n\nWait, that can't be right because the F2 should have 100% accounted for. Let me count:\n\n- CcBb: 25%\n- ccBb: 25%\n- ccbb: 50%\n- Ccbb: 25%\n\nTotal: 100%.\n\nNow, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- A: 25%\n- B: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- C: 50%\n- D: 0%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 25:A : 50:B : 50:C : 0:D \u2192 which simplifies to 1:A : 2:B : 2:C : 0:D. But that doesn't match any of the options provided. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscounted the phenotypes. Let me re-express:\n\n- A: 25%\n- B:",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Their counts would be 9,3,3,1 respectively. So the answer should reflect that.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options sum to 16. So which one represents the correct distribution? According to our calculations, the correct distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nBut looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier because in reality, the number of phenotypes in F2 is four: A, B, C, D. Their counts would be 9,3,3,1 respectively. So the answer should reflect that. Checking the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Wait, let's double-check. The fraction for Phenotype A is 9/16, so in a group of 16 birds, 9 would have both traits. But the options are giving smaller numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states: \"the F2 generation.\" The parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is the next generation, which is obtained by selfing F1. So the correct approach is to look at the possible gametes and their proportions. F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (25% each). So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent produces CB or cb, so F2 will have CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each F1 can produce CB or cb, so F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n- 25% CcBb (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% CcBb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% CcBb (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% ccbb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut we're interested in phenotypes, so we need to map these genotypes to phenotypes. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and B is present (brown).\n\nSo:\n\n- CcBb: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb: Same \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccbb: C absent (plain), B absent (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the F2 population consists of four types of birds:\n1. 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. 25% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, that's four types, but the options suggest three phenotypes. That indicates that I'm missing something. Oh! Because the F2 population includes not just the four types I've identified but also any additional phenotypes derived from other combinations. Wait, no\u2014each bird has exactly two traits, so the four types I listed cover all possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, but according to my previous analysis, the phenotypes should be:\n\n- Phenotype A: C and B present \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 25%\n\nBut according to the options, the answer choices are based on the counts of each phenotype, not percentages. So in a large sample, the counts would reflect the proportions. Let's assume a population of 16 birds:\n\n- 12 would have both traits (phenotype A)\n- 4 would have only C (phenotype B)\n- 4 would have only B (phenotype C)\n- 0 would have neither (phenotype D)\n\nWait, but according to the calculations earlier, the fraction for both traits was 9/16, which would correspond to 9 birds out of 16 having both traits, and the remaining 7 having only one trait. But none of the options match this exact breakdown. However, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis corresponds to the count of 9, 3, 1, 3, which sum to 16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options sum to 16. But looking at the options, the actual counts are:\n\nOption E: 3 (checkered red), 9 (checkered brown), 1 (plain red), 3 (plain brown)\n\nSo that aligns with our calculation: Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts, which would translate to 9, but according to the options, it's 3. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Wait, let's double-check. The fraction for Phenotype A is 9/16, so in a group of 16 birds, 9 would have both traits. But the options are giving smaller numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states: \"the F2 generation.\" The parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is the next generation, which is obtained by selfing F1. So the correct approach is to look at the possible gametes and their proportions. F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (25% each). So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent produces CB or cb, so F2 will have CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each F1 can produce CB or cb, so F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n- 25% CcBb (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% CcBb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% CcBb (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% ccbb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut we're interested in phenotypes, so we need to map these genotypes to phenotypes. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and B is present (brown).\n\nSo:\n\n- CcBb: C present (red), B present (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb: Same as above \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb: Same \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccbb: C absent (plain), B absent (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the F2 population consists of four types of birds:\n1. 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. 25% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, that's four types, but the options suggest three phenotypes. That indicates that I'm missing something. Oh! Because the F2 population includes not just the four types I've identified but also any additional phenotypes derived from other combinations. Wait, no\u2014each bird has exactly two traits, so the four types I listed cover all possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, but according to my previous analysis, the phenotypes should be:\n\n- Phenotype A: C and B present \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 25%\n\nBut according to the options, the answer choices are based on the counts of each phenotype, not percentages. So in a large sample, the counts would reflect the proportions. Let's assume a population of 16 birds:\n\n- 12 would have both traits (phenotype A)\n- 4 would have only C (phenotype B)\n- 4 would have only B (phenotype C)\n- 0 would have neither (phenotype D)\n\nWait, but according to the calculations earlier, the fraction for both traits was 9/16, which would correspond to 9 birds out of 16 having both traits, and the remaining 7 having only one trait. But none of the options match this exact breakdown. However, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis corresponds to the count of 9, 3, 1, 3, which sum to 16. Wait, but according to the calculations, 9/16 should correspond to 9, while 7/16 would correspond to 7. But why does Option E have 9 instead of 7?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me try again. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Neither present \u2192 1/16\n\nIf we take 16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nBut according to the options, the counts are:\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich is exactly what we get: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 summing to 16.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, let me double-check. For each bird, the probability of having both traits is 9/16, only C is 3/16, only B is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. So in terms of counts, if there are 16 birds, the distribution would be: 9 red-brown, 3 red-checkered, 3 plain-brown, 1 plain-checkered. That's exactly what option C states. So why does option E have 3,9,1,3? Because it's the reverse order. Option E lists checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). That would correspond to the ratio 3:9:1:3, which is equivalent to 9:3:3:1 if reversed, but that's not standard. Typically, the order is based on the traits, not the count order.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, Phenotype C should have 1 part, which is 1, Phenotype B has 3, Phenotype A has 9, and Phenotype D has 3. But the options are labeled as A to J, with their own pheno ratios. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's exactly what we calculated.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Checkered red 5, brown 3, plain 2, red 6 \u2192 Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, meaning Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But looking at the options, none exactly match this. Let me double-check. Oh, wait! I think I made a mistake. Because in reality, the presence of C and B as dominant alleles results in the respective traits, but the presence of both dominant alleles is what causes both traits. So the correct count should be:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1 part\n\nBut the options don't have this exact ratio. Let me look again. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's 3:9:1:3, which is similar to our 9:3:3:1 but scaled by a factor of 3. So if we divide each by 3, we get 3:3:1:1, which still doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the mapping of the letters. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the B locus, and \"plain\" refers to the C locus. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red is controlled by B, brown by b.\n\nSo, in terms of coat color:\n\n- Checkered: recessive (b) for B and recessive (c) for b\n- Plain: dominant (C) for B and dominant (c) for b\n\nSimilarly, pigment red:\n\n- Red: dominant (B)\n- Brown: recessive (b)\n\nSo, the phenotypes can be defined as:\n\n1. Pigment red and checkered: B and b\n2. Pigment red and brown: B and b (wait, no\u2014if B is dominant, red is always present, and b is recessive for B but not necessarily for b.)\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, a bird is:\n\n- Pigment red if it has at least one B allele (since B is dominant)\n- Brown if it has at least one b allele (since b is recessive for B)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Checkered if it has at least one b allele (since b is recessive for B)\n- Plain if it has at least one c allele (since c is recessive for B)\n\nBut wait, the problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by dominant gene C (so C is dominant for checkered)\n- Checkered is recessive c for C\n- Red is dominant B (B is dominant for red)\n- Brown is recessive b (b is recessive for B)\n\nSo, the presence of dominant alleles for B and c will affect the color, while the presence of dominant alleles for C and c will affect the pattern. So, the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (B present) and checkered (c present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (B present) and brown (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c present) and red (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c present) and brown (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of B and b alleles:\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- Pigment red (B present): 3/4\n- Brown (b present): 1/4\n\nFor the C locus (pattern):\n\n- Checkered (c present): 3/4\n- Plain (c absent): 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are products of their individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: B present and c present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2: B present and b present \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3: c present and B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4: c present and b present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSumming these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this, but option E is 3,9,1,3\u2014which is the reverse order of the above. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This corresponds to Phenotype 1:3, Phenotype 2:9, Phenotype 3:1, Phenotype 4:3. Which is indeed the reciprocal of our calculation. So if the question asks for the expected phenotypes starting from the checkered and plain patterns, then option E would be correct. But wait, the options are labeled as A to Z, but in the original prompt, they were numbered from A to J. So perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking back: The user listed options A through J, each with different counts. So, the correct answer should be option E, which corresponds to the ratio 3:9:1:3, but depending on how the phenotypes are named. Alternatively, perhaps the names are swapped. Let me verify the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Yes, this aligns with our calculation, but the order is reversed compared to our calculation. So perhaps the question expects the order to be checkered red first, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. But in reality, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and checkered\n2. Pigment red and brown\n3. Plain and red\n4. Plain and brown\n\nIf the question lists the phenotypes in the order of pigment red-first, then plain-red, then brown-second, then plain-brown, that would correspond to our ratios as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3 (phenotype 1)\n- Pigment red and brown: 9 (phenotype 2)\n- Plain and red: 1 (phenotype 3)\n- Plain and brown: 3 (phenotype 4)\n\nWhich matches option E. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 L.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 M.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 N.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 O.6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 P.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 Q.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 R.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 S.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 T.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 U. Checkered red 5, brown 3, plain 2, red 6 \u2192 Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, meaning Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But looking at the options, none exactly match this. Let me double-check. Oh, wait! I think I made a mistake. Because in reality, the presence of C and B as dominant alleles results in the respective traits, but the presence of both dominant alleles is what causes both traits. So the correct count should be:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1 part\n\nBut the options don't have this exact ratio. Let me look again. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's 3:9:1:3, which is similar to our 9:3:3:1 but scaled by a factor of 3. So if we divide each by 3, we get 3:3:1:1, which still doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the mapping of the letters. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the B locus, and \"plain\" refers to the C locus. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red is controlled by B, brown by b.\n\nSo, in terms of coat color:\n\n- Checkered: recessive (b) for B and recessive (c) for b\n- Plain: dominant (C) for B and dominant (c) for b\n\nSimilarly, pigment red:\n\n- Red: dominant (B)\n- Brown: recessive (b)\n\nSo, the phenotypes can be defined as:\n\n1. Pigment red and checkered: B and b\n2. Pigment red and brown: B and b (wait, no\u2014if B is dominant, red is always present, and b is recessive for B but not necessarily for b.)\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, a bird is:\n\n- Pigment red if it has at least one B allele (since B is dominant)\n- Brown if it has at least one b allele (since b is recessive for B)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Checkered if it has at least one b allele (since b is recessive for B)\n- Plain if it has at least one c allele (since c is recessive for B)\n\nBut wait, the problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by dominant gene C (so C is dominant for checkered)\n- Checkered is recessive c for C\n- Red is dominant B (B is dominant for red)\n- Brown is recessive b (b is recessive for B)\n\nSo, the presence of dominant alleles for B and c will affect the color, while the presence of dominant alleles for C and c will affect the pattern. So, the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (B present) and checkered (c present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (B present) and brown (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c present) and red (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c present) and brown (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of B and b alleles:\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n\n- Pigment red (B present): 3/4\n- Brown (b present): 1/4\n\nFor the C locus (pattern):\n\n- Checkered (c present): 3/4\n- Plain (c absent): 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are products of their individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: B present and c present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2: B present and b present \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3: c present and B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4: c present and b present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSumming these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the ratios are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\n- Phenotype 4: 1\n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this, but option E is 3,9,1,3\u2014which is the reverse order of the above. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This corresponds to Phenotype 1:3, Phenotype 2:9, Phenotype 3:1, Phenotype 4:3. Which is indeed the reciprocal of our calculation. So if the question asks for the expected phenotypes starting from the checkered and plain patterns, then option E would be correct. But wait, the options are labeled as A to Z, but in the original prompt, they were numbered from A to J. So perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking back: The user listed options A through J, each with different counts. So, the correct answer should be option E, which corresponds to the ratio 3:9:1:3, but depending on how the phenotypes are named. Alternatively, perhaps the names are swapped. Let me verify the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Yes, this aligns with our calculation, but the order is reversed compared to our calculation. So perhaps the question expects the order to be checkered red first, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. But in reality, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and checkered\n2. Pigment red and brown\n3. Plain and red\n4. Plain and brown\n\nIf the question lists the phenotypes in the order of pigment red-first, then plain-red, then brown-second, then plain-brown, that would correspond to our ratios as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3 (phenotype 1)\n- Pigment red and brown: 9 (phenotype 2)\n- Plain and red: 1 (phenotype 3)\n- Plain and brown: 3 (phenotype 4)\n\nWhich matches option E. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All options sum to 16, which aligns with our calculations. Now, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype B) \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype C) \u2192 3\n- Plain red (Phenotype D) \u2192 1\n- Plain brown (Phenotype A) \u2192 9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to 3,9,1,3, matching our count.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes ratios are presented in terms of counts without the denominators, so 9:3:3:1 translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc. But the options list them as counts for each phenotype. So option E matches exactly with 3,9,1,3.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "rollout": " All add up to 16. Hmm, so all options seem plausible in terms of the sum. But looking at the actual counts, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. From the F1 (CcBb), the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (phenotype A: red and brown)\n- 25% Cc (phenotype B: red and checkered)\n- 25% cc (phenotype C: plain and brown)\n- 25% bb (phenotype D: plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.

But the options provided do not include this exact ratio. Instead, the options are grouped into pairs, such as \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2\" implying a ratio of 6:2, but that's half of the total 8. This suggests that perhaps the question expects the ratio per pair, ignoring the individual contributions. Alternatively, maybe I've misapplied the Punnett square.\n\nWait, let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. Each parent (F1) is CcBb, which can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete would be a combination of one allele from each gene. So the possible gametes are CB (from C and B), and cb (from c and b). So the F1 is CcBb, and it produces gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc: only C present \u2192 red and checkered\n- cc: only B present \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb: neither present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nThe phenotypic ratio is therefore 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. However, the answer options group these into two categories each, like \"checkered red\" and \"plain red,\" etc. So, for example, option A is checkered red (9) vs plain red (3), and similarly for brown. Option E groups checkered red (3) vs plain brown (9), etc. But according to the calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the option grouping as follows:\n\nCheckered red: 9\nPlain red: 3\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 All add up to 16. Hmm, so all options seem plausible in terms of the sum. But looking at the actual counts, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. From the F1 (CcBb), the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (phenotype A: red and brown)\n- 25% Cc (phenotype B: red and checkered)\n- 25% cc (phenotype C: plain and brown)\n- 25% bb (phenotype D: plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B \u2192 present\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 present\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 present\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 absent\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for A:B:C:D. But the options provided do not include this exact ratio. Instead, the options are grouped into pairs, such as \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2\" implying a ratio of 6:2, but that's half of the total 8. This suggests that perhaps the question expects the ratio per pair, ignoring the individual contributions. Alternatively, maybe I've misapplied the Punnett square.\n\nWait, let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. Each parent (F1) is CcBb, which can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete would be a combination of one allele from each gene. So the possible gametes are CB (from C and B), and cb (from c and b). So the F1 is CcBb, and it produces gametes CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc: only C present \u2192 red and checkered\n- cc: only B present \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb: neither present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nThe phenotypic ratio is therefore 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. However, the answer options group these into two categories each, like \"checkered red\" and \"plain red,\" etc. So, for example, option A is checkered red (9) vs plain red (3), and similarly for brown. Option E groups checkered red (3) vs plain brown (9), etc. But according to the calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the option grouping as follows:\n\nCheckered red: 9\nPlain red: 3\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching exactly. Let me look again. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we have. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to checkered red 9, plain red 3, checkered brown 3, plain brown 1. Which matches option A. Option A is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option B is 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16, which fits the 9:3:3:1 but scaled down. Option C is 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16, which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C is 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red 9, plain red 3, checkered brown 3, plain brown 1. But none of the options explicitly state this. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F L.2,6,3,1 \u2192 same as J M.12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G N.6,2,6,2 \u2192 same as A O.3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as E. So according to our calculations, the correct distribution is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. This corresponds to option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But in option E, it's 3,9,1,3. Our calculation shows 9,3,3,1, which is similar but reversed.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16 E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 F.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16 G.12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16 H.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16 I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 J.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12 K.4,4,4,4 L.12,2,2,0 M.1,3,9,3 N.5,3,2,6 O.3,9,1,3. Hmm, looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. So the ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
