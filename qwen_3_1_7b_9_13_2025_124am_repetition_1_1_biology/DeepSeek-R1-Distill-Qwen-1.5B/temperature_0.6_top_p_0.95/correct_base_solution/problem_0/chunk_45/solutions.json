    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some phenotypes might overlap.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some phenotypes might overlap. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the possible genotypes are:\n\n  1. CC (from CB + CB): Probability = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n  2. Cc (from CB + cb): Probability = 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 Phenotype depends on whether the individual is heterozygous for both genes.\n     - If the bird is heterozygous for both, like CcBb, then it would exhibit both traits. Wait, no. Actually, for each gene, if the bird is heterozygous, it shows the dominant trait. So CcBb would be Checkered red brown? Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Let me clarify: For each gene separately, if the bird is heterozygous, it shows the dominant trait. So for the C gene: C is dominant, c is recessive. For the B gene: B is dominant, b is recessive.\n\nSo in terms of phenotype:\n\n- For the C gene: C (red) over c (plain)\n- For the B gene: B (brown) over b (checkered)\n\nSo a bird that is CcBb would be:\n\n- Pigment color: Checkered (since it's heterozygous for C)\n- Color: Brown (heterozygous for B)\nThus, the phenotype would be \"Checkered brown\".\n\nSimilarly, for CcBb, it's Checkered brown.\n\nFor the Cc genotype, the bird could also be either Cc or cc depending on the B gene. Wait, no\u2014C and c are independent. So for each gene, the bird's expression is determined independently. Thus, a bird with genotype CcBb would express both traits: Checkered (for C) and Brown (for B).\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, the user provides various phenotypic ratios, including option D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. Hmm. Alternatively, another approach is to determine the number of each phenotype in F2 based on the dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to calculate the number of each phenotype in F2 without relying solely on the standard dihybrid cross formula. The F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. The F1 is CcBb, as established. So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (probability: 1/4)\n2. CC Bb (probability: 1/4)\n3. CC bb (probability: 1/4)\n4. Cc BB (probability: 1/4)\n5. Cc Bb (probability: 1/4)\n6. Cc bb (probability: 1/4)\n7. cc BB (probability: 1/4)\n8. cc Bb (probability: 1/4)\n9. cc bb (probability: 1/4)\n\nBut wait, that's nine possible genotypes, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment). Now, let's map each genotype to its phenotype based on the dominant/recessive rules.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: Dominant (red) over c (plain)\n- B: Dominant (brown) over b (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird is Checkered red if it is cc BB.\n\nIt is Checkered brown if it is cc Bb.\n\nIt is plain red if it is cc bb.\n\nIt is plain brown if it is Cc BB.\n\nIt is brown checkered if it is Cc Bb.\n\nIt is brown plain if it is Cc bb.\n\nAnd finally, it is Checkered brown if it's Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no, let me re-express:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n- For each gene independently, if the bird has at least one dominant allele, it expresses that trait.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- If a bird has both alleles for a particular trait (e.g., C), it exhibits that trait.\n\nSo, for the C gene:\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B present \u2192 Brown checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C present \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Both C and B \u2192 Red brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 B absent \u2192 Brown plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 c present \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c present \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, count how many of each phenotype there are.\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (CC BB) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 2: Brown checkered (CC Bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 3: Checkered brown (CC bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 4: Red (Cc BB) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 5: Red brown (Cc Bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 6: Brown plain (Cc bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 7: Plain red (cc BB) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 8: Checkered brown (cc Bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 9: Plain brown (cc bb) \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, that adds up to 9 birds in total, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, let's tally the counts:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird\n- Red: 1 bird\n- Red brown: 1 bird\n- Brown plain: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (duplicate)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nHmm, that seems off. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the nine cases:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo now, let's categorize them properly:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Cases 1 and 7 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Brown checkered**: Case 2 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Cases 3 and 8 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Red**: Case 4 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Red brown**: Case 5 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Brown plain**: Case 6 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: Case 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Case 8 \u2192 already counted above?\nWait, case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 which is Checkered brown. So:\n\nWait, case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 which is Checkered brown. So that's another Checkered brown. So total Checkered brown is 3 birds (cases 3,8, and any others?)\n\nNo, only cases 3 and 8 are Checkered brown. Wait, case 3 is CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown, case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown. So that's 2 Checkered browns. Plus case 3 and 8, so 2 Checkered browns. But according to my earlier tally, case 3 was Checkered brown, case 8 is another. So total Checkered browns are 2.\n\nWait, but case 3 is CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown. Case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown. That's 2 birds. Then, in case 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Red brown. And case 6: Cc bb \u2192 Brown plain. Case 4: Cc BB \u2192 Red. Case 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red. Case 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red. Case 2: CC Bb \u2192 Brown checkered. Case 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Cases 1 and 7 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Brown checkered**: Case 2 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Cases 3 and 8 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Red**: Case 4 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Red brown**: Case 5 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Brown plain**: Case 6 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: Case 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain brown**: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n\nAdding these up: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 birds, but that's impossible because there are only 9 possible genotypes, each producing one bird in F2. So clearly, I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAh, I see! Because in reality, each bird contributes one egg, so each genotype results in one bird. Therefore, the sum should be 9. Let me recount:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1 bird (case 1)\n- **Brown checkered**: 1 bird (case 2)\n- **Checkered brown**: 1 bird (case 3)\n- **Red**: 1 bird (case 4)\n- **Red brown**: 1 bird (case 5)\n- **Brown plain**: 1 bird (case 6)\n- **Plain red**: 1 bird (case 7)\n- **Checkered brown**: 1 bird (case 8)\n- **Plain brown**: 1 bird (case 9)\n\nWait, that sums to 9 birds, which makes sense. So each phenotype corresponds to multiple genotypes, but each genotype leads to one bird. Therefore, the actual counts per phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird (case 1)\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird (case 2)\n- Checkered brown: 2 birds (cases 3 and 8)\n- Red: 1 bird (case 4)\n- Red brown: 1 bird (case 5)\n- Brown plain: 1 bird (case 6)\n- Plain red: 1 bird (case 7)\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (case 8)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird (case 9)\n\nWait, but that still totals 9. So, the phenotypic counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 2 birds\n- Red: 1 bird\n- Red brown: 1 bird\n- Brown plain: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because some phenotypes are listed twice. Wait, no\u2014it's correct because case 3 and case 8 are separate Checkered browns, adding up to 2 birds. Similarly, case 4 is Red, case 5 is Red brown, case 6 is Brown plain, case 7 is Plain red, and case 9 is Plain brown. So the counts per phenotype are:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1 bird\n- **Brown checkered**: 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: 2 birds\n- **Red**: 1 bird\n- **Red brown**: 1 bird\n- **Brown plain**: 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: 1 bird (duplicate, so it's 2)\n- **Plain brown**: 1 bird\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Perhaps I should structure it differently:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Birds\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | 1 bird (case 1)\nBrown checkered | 1 bird (case 2)\nCheckered brown | 2 birds (cases 3 and 8)\nRed | 1 bird (case 4)\nRed brown | 1 bird (case 5)\nBrown plain | 1 bird (case 6)\nPlain red | 1 bird (case 7)\nCheckered brown | 1 bird (case 8) \u2192 Total Checkered browns: 3 birds\nPlain brown | 1 bird (case 9)\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Red: 1 bird\n- Red brown: 1 bird\n- Brown plain: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (duplicate, so total 3)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nNow, arranging them in order of phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: 1\n2. Brown checkered: 1\n3. Checkered brown: 3\n4. Red: 1\n5. Red brown: 1\n6. Brown plain: 1\n7. Plain red: 1\n8. Checkered brown: 1 (duplicate, so total 3)\n9. Plain brown: 1\n\nWait, but that's still overlapping. Maybe I should consider that each phenotype includes multiple genotypes, but each genotype leads to one bird. So, the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of birds per phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Brown checkered: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Red: 1\n- Red brown: 1\n- Brown plain: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 1 (but this is already included in Checkered brown)\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis isn't working because it's double-counting. Let me instead list each unique phenotype and count accordingly:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 2 birds\n- Red: 1 bird\n- Red brown: 1 bird\n- Brown plain: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (another case)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should use a different approach. Let's count how many birds fall into each phenotype:\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (1 bird)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown checkered (1 bird)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1 bird)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red (1 bird)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red brown (1 bird)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown plain (1 bird)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (1 bird)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1 bird)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (1 bird)\n\nSo, now mapping each:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Cases 1, 7 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Brown checkered**: Case 2 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Cases 3, 8 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Red**: Case 4 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Red brown**: Case 5 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Brown plain**: Case 6 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: Case 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Case 8 \u2192 1 bird (already counted as 2)\n- **Plain brown**: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Birds\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | 2 (cases 1 and 7)\nBrown checkered | 1 (case 2)\nCheckered brown | 2 (cases 3 and 8)\nRed | 1 (case 4)\nRed brown | 1 (case 5)\nBrown plain | 1 (case 6)\nPlain red | 1 (case 7)\nCheckered brown | 1 (case 8) \u2192 This is duplicate, so total 3\nPlain brown | 1 (case 9)\n\nWait, no. Case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown. So Checkered brown is 2 birds (cases 3 and 8). Red is 1 bird (case 4). Red brown is 1 bird (case 5). Brown plain is 1 bird (case 6). Plain red is 1 bird (case 7). Checkered brown: 2 (cases 3 and 8). Plain brown: 1 (case 9).\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2\n- Brown checkered: 1\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Red: 1\n- Red brown: 1\n- Brown plain: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 1 (duplicate, so 2)\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nWait, but this still adds up incorrectly. Let's total them:\n\n2 (Checkered red) + 1 (Brown checkered) + 2 (Checkered brown) + 1 (Red) + 1 (Red brown) + 1 (Brown plain) + 1 (Plain red) + 1 (Checkered brown) + 1 (Plain brown) = 12 birds, which is impossible because F2 has only 9 genotypes, each leading to one bird. So I must have miscounted.\n\nThe error arises because some phenotypes correspond to multiple genotypes. Let me correct this by listing each phenotype with the number of genotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered red** (CC BB) \u2192 1 genotype\n2. **Brown checkered** (CC Bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n3. **Checkered brown** (CC bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n4. **Red** (Cc BB) \u2192 1 genotype\n5. **Red brown** (Cc Bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n6. **Brown plain** (Cc bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n7. **Plain red** (cc BB) \u2192 1 genotype\n8. **Checkered brown** (cc Bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n9. **Plain brown** (cc bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n\nNow, assigning each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird (case 1)\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird (case 2)\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (case 3)\n- Red: 1 bird (case 4)\n- Red brown: 1 bird (case 5)\n- Brown plain: 1 bird (case 6)\n- Plain",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some phenotypes might overlap. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the possible genotypes are:\n\n  1. CC (from CB + CB): Probability = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n  2. Cc (from CB + cb): Probability = 2*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 Phenotype depends on whether the individual is heterozygous for both genes.\n     - If the bird is heterozygous for both, like CcBb, then it would exhibit both traits. Wait, no. Actually, for each gene, if the bird is heterozygous, it shows the dominant trait. So CcBb would be Checkered red brown? Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Let me clarify: For each gene separately, if the bird is heterozygous, it shows the dominant trait. So for the C gene: C is dominant, c is recessive. For the B gene: B is dominant, b is recessive.\n\nSo in terms of phenotype:\n\n- For the C gene: C (red) over c (plain)\n- For the B gene: B (brown) over b (checkered)\n\nSo a bird that is CcBb would be:\n\n- Pigment color: Checkered (since it's heterozygous for C)\n- Color: Brown (heterozygous for B)\nThus, the phenotype would be \"Checkered brown\".\n\nSimilarly, for CcBb, it's Checkered brown.\n\nFor the Cc genotype, the bird could also be either Cc or cc depending on the B gene. Wait, no\u2014C and c are independent. So for each gene, the bird's expression is determined independently. Thus, a bird with genotype CcBb would express both traits: Checkered (for C) and Brown (for B).\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, the user provides various phenotypic ratios, including option D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. Hmm. Alternatively, another approach is to determine the number of each phenotype in F2 based on the dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to calculate the number of each phenotype in F2 without relying solely on the standard dihybrid cross formula. The F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. The F1 is CcBb, as established. So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (probability: 1/4)\n2. CC Bb (probability: 1/4)\n3. CC bb (probability: 1/4)\n4. Cc BB (probability: 1/4)\n5. Cc Bb (probability: 1/4)\n6. Cc bb (probability: 1/4)\n7. cc BB (probability: 1/4)\n8. cc Bb (probability: 1/4)\n9. cc bb (probability: 1/4)\n\nBut wait, that's nine possible genotypes, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment). Now, let's map each genotype to its phenotype based on the dominant/recessive rules.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: Dominant (red) over c (plain)\n- B: Dominant (brown) over b (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird is Checkered red if it is cc BB.\n\nIt is Checkered brown if it is cc Bb.\n\nIt is plain red if it is cc bb.\n\nIt is plain brown if it is Cc BB.\n\nIt is brown checkered if it is Cc Bb.\n\nIt is brown plain if it is Cc bb.\n\nAnd finally, it is Checkered brown if it's Cc Bb.\n\nWait, no, let me re-express:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nSo:\n\n- For each gene independently, if the bird has at least one dominant allele, it expresses that trait.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- If a bird has both alleles for a particular trait (e.g., C), it exhibits that trait.\n\nSo, for the C gene:\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B present \u2192 Brown checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C present \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Both C and B \u2192 Red brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 B absent \u2192 Brown plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 c present \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c present \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, count how many of each phenotype there are.\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (CC BB) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 2: Brown checkered (CC Bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 3: Checkered brown (CC bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 4: Red (Cc BB) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 5: Red brown (Cc Bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 6: Brown plain (Cc bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 7: Plain red (cc BB) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 8: Checkered brown (cc Bb) \u2192 1 bird\nPhenotype 9: Plain brown (cc bb) \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, that adds up to 9 birds in total, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, let's tally the counts:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird\n- Red: 1 bird\n- Red brown: 1 bird\n- Brown plain: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (duplicate)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nHmm, that seems off. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the nine cases:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo now, let's categorize them properly:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Cases 1 and 7 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Brown checkered**: Case 2 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Cases 3 and 8 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Red**: Case 4 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Red brown**: Case 5 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Brown plain**: Case 6 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: Case 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Case 8 \u2192 already counted above?\nWait, case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 which is Checkered brown. So:\n\nWait, case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 which is Checkered brown. So that's another Checkered brown. So total Checkered brown is 3 birds (cases 3,8, and any others?)\n\nNo, only cases 3 and 8 are Checkered brown. Wait, case 3 is CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown, case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown. So that's 2 Checkered browns. Plus case 3 and 8, so 2 Checkered browns. But according to my earlier tally, case 3 was Checkered brown, case 8 is another. So total Checkered browns are 2.\n\nWait, but case 3 is CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown. Case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown. That's 2 birds. Then, in case 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Red brown. And case 6: Cc bb \u2192 Brown plain. Case 4: Cc BB \u2192 Red. Case 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red. Case 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red. Case 2: CC Bb \u2192 Brown checkered. Case 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain brown.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Cases 1 and 7 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Brown checkered**: Case 2 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Cases 3 and 8 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Red**: Case 4 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Red brown**: Case 5 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Brown plain**: Case 6 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: Case 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain brown**: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n\nAdding these up: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 birds, but that's impossible because there are only 9 possible genotypes, each producing one bird in F2. So clearly, I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAh, I see! Because in reality, each bird contributes one egg, so each genotype results in one bird. Therefore, the sum should be 9. Let me recount:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1 bird (case 1)\n- **Brown checkered**: 1 bird (case 2)\n- **Checkered brown**: 1 bird (case 3)\n- **Red**: 1 bird (case 4)\n- **Red brown**: 1 bird (case 5)\n- **Brown plain**: 1 bird (case 6)\n- **Plain red**: 1 bird (case 7)\n- **Checkered brown**: 1 bird (case 8)\n- **Plain brown**: 1 bird (case 9)\n\nWait, that sums to 9 birds, which makes sense. So each phenotype corresponds to multiple genotypes, but each genotype leads to one bird. Therefore, the actual counts per phenotype are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird (case 1)\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird (case 2)\n- Checkered brown: 2 birds (cases 3 and 8)\n- Red: 1 bird (case 4)\n- Red brown: 1 bird (case 5)\n- Brown plain: 1 bird (case 6)\n- Plain red: 1 bird (case 7)\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (case 8)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird (case 9)\n\nWait, but that still totals 9. So, the phenotypic counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 2 birds\n- Red: 1 bird\n- Red brown: 1 bird\n- Brown plain: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because some phenotypes are listed twice. Wait, no\u2014it's correct because case 3 and case 8 are separate Checkered browns, adding up to 2 birds. Similarly, case 4 is Red, case 5 is Red brown, case 6 is Brown plain, case 7 is Plain red, and case 9 is Plain brown. So the counts per phenotype are:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1 bird\n- **Brown checkered**: 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: 2 birds\n- **Red**: 1 bird\n- **Red brown**: 1 bird\n- **Brown plain**: 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: 1 bird (duplicate, so it's 2)\n- **Plain brown**: 1 bird\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Perhaps I should structure it differently:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Birds\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | 1 bird (case 1)\nBrown checkered | 1 bird (case 2)\nCheckered brown | 2 birds (cases 3 and 8)\nRed | 1 bird (case 4)\nRed brown | 1 bird (case 5)\nBrown plain | 1 bird (case 6)\nPlain red | 1 bird (case 7)\nCheckered brown | 1 bird (case 8) \u2192 Total Checkered browns: 3 birds\nPlain brown | 1 bird (case 9)\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Red: 1 bird\n- Red brown: 1 bird\n- Brown plain: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (duplicate, so total 3)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nNow, arranging them in order of phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: 1\n2. Brown checkered: 1\n3. Checkered brown: 3\n4. Red: 1\n5. Red brown: 1\n6. Brown plain: 1\n7. Plain red: 1\n8. Checkered brown: 1 (duplicate, so total 3)\n9. Plain brown: 1\n\nWait, but that's still overlapping. Maybe I should consider that each phenotype includes multiple genotypes, but each genotype leads to one bird. So, the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of birds per phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Brown checkered: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Red: 1\n- Red brown: 1\n- Brown plain: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 1 (but this is already included in Checkered brown)\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis isn't working because it's double-counting. Let me instead list each unique phenotype and count accordingly:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 2 birds\n- Red: 1 bird\n- Red brown: 1 bird\n- Brown plain: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (another case)\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should use a different approach. Let's count how many birds fall into each phenotype:\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (1 bird)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown checkered (1 bird)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1 bird)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red (1 bird)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red brown (1 bird)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown plain (1 bird)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (1 bird)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1 bird)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown (1 bird)\n\nSo, now mapping each:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Cases 1, 7 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Brown checkered**: Case 2 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Cases 3, 8 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Red**: Case 4 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Red brown**: Case 5 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Brown plain**: Case 6 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: Case 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: Case 8 \u2192 1 bird (already counted as 2)\n- **Plain brown**: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Birds\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | 2 (cases 1 and 7)\nBrown checkered | 1 (case 2)\nCheckered brown | 2 (cases 3 and 8)\nRed | 1 (case 4)\nRed brown | 1 (case 5)\nBrown plain | 1 (case 6)\nPlain red | 1 (case 7)\nCheckered brown | 1 (case 8) \u2192 This is duplicate, so total 3\nPlain brown | 1 (case 9)\n\nWait, no. Case 8 is cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown. So Checkered brown is 2 birds (cases 3 and 8). Red is 1 bird (case 4). Red brown is 1 bird (case 5). Brown plain is 1 bird (case 6). Plain red is 1 bird (case 7). Checkered brown: 2 (cases 3 and 8). Plain brown: 1 (case 9).\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2\n- Brown checkered: 1\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Red: 1\n- Red brown: 1\n- Brown plain: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 1 (duplicate, so 2)\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nWait, but this still adds up incorrectly. Let's total them:\n\n2 (Checkered red) + 1 (Brown checkered) + 2 (Checkered brown) + 1 (Red) + 1 (Red brown) + 1 (Brown plain) + 1 (Plain red) + 1 (Checkered brown) + 1 (Plain brown) = 12 birds, which is impossible because F2 has only 9 genotypes, each leading to one bird. So I must have miscounted.\n\nThe error arises because some phenotypes correspond to multiple genotypes. Let me correct this by listing each phenotype with the number of genotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered red** (CC BB) \u2192 1 genotype\n2. **Brown checkered** (CC Bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n3. **Checkered brown** (CC bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n4. **Red** (Cc BB) \u2192 1 genotype\n5. **Red brown** (Cc Bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n6. **Brown plain** (Cc bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n7. **Plain red** (cc BB) \u2192 1 genotype\n8. **Checkered brown** (cc Bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n9. **Plain brown** (cc bb) \u2192 1 genotype\n\nNow, assigning each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird (case 1)\n- Brown checkered: 1 bird (case 2)\n- Checkered brown: 1 bird (case 3)\n- Red: 1 bird (case 4)\n- Red brown: 1 bird (case 5)\n- Brown plain: 1 bird (case 6)\n- Plain",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene assort independently.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene assort independently. So for gene C: C/C and c/c. For gene B: B/B and b/b.\n\nWait, perhaps the Punnett square approach is better. Let me try that. The F1 is CcBb. So when crossed with itself:\n\nThe F2 will have genotypes based on the combination of Cc and Bb alleles from each parent.\n\nFor gene C: Each parent contributes either C or c. So the possible combinations are CC, Cc, cC, cc. But since Cc and cC are the same, we'll have 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B: Each parent contributes either B or b. So the possible combinations are BB, Bb, bB, bb. Again, same as above: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype for C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nPhenotype for B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratio is calculated by considering all combinations. However, since the colors are controlled by multiple genes, each trait (color and pigmentation) is influenced by these genes. The dominance relationships are as follows:\n\n- For C: C (red) is dominant over c (plain).\n- For B: B (brown) is dominant over b (checkered).\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): Checkered red\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): Checkered brown\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): Plain red\n\nNow, we calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the probability of each genotype:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, multiply the probabilities:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_):\n25% (C_) * 25% (B_) = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nPlain red (cc_b_):\n25% (cc) * 25% (B_) = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nCheckered brown (C_bb):\n25% (C_) * 50% (bb) = 12.5% \u2192 1/8\n\nPlain brown (cc_B_):\n50% (cc) * 25% (B_) = 12.5% \u2192 1/8\n\nBut wait, that doesn't add up correctly. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- C_B_: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- C_bb_: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc_B_: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc_bb_: 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56%. Hmm, that's less than 100%, so there must be something wrong. Oh, right! Because in reality, the phenotypes correspond to the presence of dominant alleles, so the actual phenotypic ratio should consider the dominance hierarchy without double-counting. Let's re-examine:\n\nEach individual will display the phenotype corresponding to the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele in C and at least one dominant allele in B: Checkered red (since both genes are dominant)\n2. Dominant in C, recessive in B: Checkered brown\n3. Recessive in C, dominant in B: Plain brown\n4. Recessive in both: Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (C_) * 25% (B_) = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 25% (C_) * 50% (bb) = 12.5%\n- Plain brown: 50% (cc) * 25% (B_) = 12.5%\n- Plain red: 50% (cc) * 50% (bb) = 25%\n\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56%. Wait, that still doesn't make sense. There must be an error in my calculation. Actually, the correct way is to recognize that the phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the probabilities should be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of having a dominant allele is:\n\nGene C:\n- Dominant (C): 75% (C_)\n- Recessive (c): 25% (cc)\n\nGene B:\n- Dominant (B): 75% (BB or Bb)\n- Recessive (b): 25% (bb)\n\nThe total phenotypic ratio is then the product of the probabilities for each gene. However, since the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective phenotype, the actual phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of dominant alleles across both genes.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Both dominant (C_B_): 75% (C_) * 75% (B_) = 56.25% \u2192 9/16\n- Only C dominant (C_bb): 75% * 25% = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Only B dominant (cc_B_): 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Neither dominant (cc_bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, but adding those together: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is approximately:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25% (which is 9/16)\n- Checkered brown: 18.75% (3/16)\n- Plain brown: 18.75% (3/16)\n- Plain red: 6.25% (1/16)\n\nBut none of the options match exactly.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene assort independently. So for gene C: C/C and c/c. For gene B: B/B and b/b.\n\nWait, perhaps the Punnett square approach is better. Let me try that. The F1 is CcBb. So when crossed with itself:\n\nThe F2 will have genotypes based on the combination of Cc and Bb alleles from each parent.\n\nFor gene C: Each parent contributes either C or c. So the possible combinations are CC, Cc, cC, cc. But since Cc and cC are the same, we'll have 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSimilarly, for gene B: Each parent contributes either B or b. So the possible combinations are BB, Bb, bB, bb. Again, same as above: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\nPhenotype for C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nPhenotype for B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratio is calculated by considering all combinations. However, since the colors are controlled by multiple genes, each trait (color and pigmentation) is influenced by these genes. The dominance relationships are as follows:\n\n- For C: C (red) is dominant over c (plain).\n- For B: B (brown) is dominant over b (checkered).\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): Checkered red\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): Checkered brown\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): Plain red\n\nNow, we calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the probability of each genotype:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, multiply the probabilities:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_):\n25% (C_) * 25% (B_) = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nPlain red (cc_b_):\n25% (cc) * 25% (B_) = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nCheckered brown (C_bb):\n25% (C_) * 50% (bb) = 12.5% \u2192 1/8\n\nPlain brown (cc_B_):\n50% (cc) * 25% (B_) = 12.5% \u2192 1/8\n\nBut wait, that doesn't add up correctly. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- C_B_: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- C_bb_: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc_B_: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc_bb_: 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56%. Hmm, that's less than 100%, so there must be something wrong. Oh, right! Because in reality, the phenotypes correspond to the presence of dominant alleles, so the actual phenotypic ratio should consider the dominance hierarchy without double-counting. Let's re-examine:\n\nEach individual will display the phenotype corresponding to the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. At least one dominant allele in C and at least one dominant allele in B: Checkered red (since both genes are dominant)\n2. Dominant in C, recessive in B: Checkered brown\n3. Recessive in C, dominant in B: Plain brown\n4. Recessive in both: Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (C_) * 25% (B_) = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 25% (C_) * 50% (bb) = 12.5%\n- Plain brown: 50% (cc) * 25% (B_) = 12.5%\n- Plain red: 50% (cc) * 50% (bb) = 25%\n\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56%. Wait, that still doesn't make sense. There must be an error in my calculation. Actually, the correct way is to recognize that the phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the probabilities should be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of having a dominant allele is:\n\nGene C:\n- Dominant (C): 75% (C_)\n- Recessive (c): 25% (cc)\n\nGene B:\n- Dominant (B): 75% (BB or Bb)\n- Recessive (b): 25% (bb)\n\nThe total phenotypic ratio is then the product of the probabilities for each gene. However, since the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective phenotype, the actual phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of dominant alleles across both genes.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Both dominant (C_B_): 75% (C_) * 75% (B_) = 56.25% \u2192 9/16\n- Only C dominant (C_bb): 75% * 25% = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Only B dominant (cc_B_): 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Neither dominant (cc_bb): 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, but adding those together: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is approximately:\n\n- Checkered red: 56.25% (which is 9/16)\n- Checkered brown: 18.75% (3/16)\n- Plain brown: 18.75% (3/16)\n- Plain red: 6.25% (1/16)\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2 (checkered red, plain red, etc.)\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, option C says 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to 56.25% (9/16), 18.75% (3/16), 18.75% (3/16), and 6.25% (1/16). That seems correct. But looking back at the user's options, option C is written as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently. So for C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Similarly for B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Combining these, the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, each with a probability of 1/16. So the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of C and B traits.\n\nNow, let's map the phenotypes. Pigmentation (B or b):\n\n- If B is present (any dominant allele), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (recessive), the bird is checkered.\n\nSimilarly, pigment color (B or b):\n\n- Dominant (B): Red\n- Recessive (b): Checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown and Red (Bb or BB)\n2. Brown and Checkered (Bb or bb)\n3. Checkered and Red (bb)\n4. Checkered and Checkered (bb)\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotype, it's either brown or checkered for pigmentation, and either red or checkered for pigment. So the combination is:\n\n- Brown and Red: B (B) \u2192 brown, and B (B) \u2192 red \u2192 Phenotype: brown-red\n- Brown and Checkered: B (B) \u2192 brown, b (b) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype: brown-checkered\n- Checkered and Red: b (b) \u2192 checkered, B (B) \u2192 red \u2192 Phenotype: checkered-red\n- Checkered and Checkered: b (b) \u2192 checkered, b (b) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype: checkered-checkered\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele c, and the red color is determined by the dominant allele B. So the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n- Brown and Red (B/B)\n- Brown and Checkered (B/b)\n- Checkered and Red (b/B)\n- Checkered and Checkered (b/b)\n\nSo now, the F2 genotypes would determine the phenotypes. Let's list the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Brown and Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered and Red\n4. CC bb (wait, no, if it's CC bb, then B is dominant, so brown, and b is recessive, checkered. So same as above.)\nWait, no, perhaps better to consider all combinations.\n\nWait, each F2 individual has a genotype for both genes. So let's create a Punnett square where each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb, each at 50%. Then, the F1 (CcBb) selfs, resulting in four possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc (for C) and BB \u00d7 BB (for B)? Wait, no\u2014let me correct that. Actually, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. So F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = Cc (C) \u00d7 Cc (B)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc (C) \u00d7 Bb (B)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc (C) \u00d7 Bb (B)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc (C) \u00d7 bb (B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The actual combinations are:\n\nFor C (gene):\n- Parent 1: C\n- Parent 2: c\nSo F1 gametes are CB and cb.\n\nFor B (gene):\n- Parent 1: B\n- Parent 2: b\nSo F1 gametes are CB and cb.\n\nThus, F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce 4 combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB: Cc (C) \u00d7 Cc (B)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (C) \u00d7 Bb (B)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (C) \u00d7 Bb (B)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb: cc (C) \u00d7 bb (B)\n\nEach of these gametes occurs with a 25% probability.\n\nNow, let's analyze the F2 phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\n1. Cc \u00d7 Cc (for C):\n   - C_: dominant (red)\n   - cc: recessive (checkered)\n   So, for C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n   For B: BB, Bb, bb\n   Thus, the combination is:\n\n   - BB: Brown and Red\n   - Bb: Brown and Checkered\n   - bb: Checkered and Red\n   - bb: Checkered and Checkered\n\n   Wait, but the combination depends on both genes. So each F2 individual will have a genotype for C and a genotype for B. Their phenotypes are determined by whether they have dominant or recessive alleles for each gene.\n\n   Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n   For C (gene):\n   - 25% CC (Red)\n   - 50% Cc (Red)\n   - 25% cc (Checkered)\n\n   For B (gene):\n   - 25% BB (Brown)\n   - 50% Bb (Brown)\n   - 25% bb (Checkered)\n\n   Now, the F2 individuals will express both traits. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Brown and Red (B/B and C/C)\n     - Occurs when B is present and C is present\n     - Probability: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n   \n   2. Brown and Checkered (B/B and C/c)\n     - Probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\n   3. Checkered and Red (b/b and C/C)\n     - Probability: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n   4. Checkered and Checkered (b/b and C/c)\n     - Probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\n   Adding up the probabilities:\n\n   - Brown and Red: 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5%?\n   Wait, no, that's not right. Because the probabilities are multiplicative for independent genes. So:\n\n   - Brown and Red: 25% (B) * 25% (C) = 6.25%\n   - Brown and Checkered: 25% (B) * 50% (C) = 12.5%\n   - Checkered and Red: 25% (b) * 25% (C) = 6.25%\n   - Checkered and Checkered: 25% (b) * 50% (C) = 12.5%\n\n   Total: 6.25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 37.5%, which doesn't add up to 100%. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\n   Wait, another approach is to realize that the total F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the four F1 gametes. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being produced, so the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each equally likely (since each F1 gamete combines with each other).\n\n   So instead of calculating probabilities separately, we can look at how many of the 16 possible F2 genotypes fall into each phenotype category.\n\n   Let's list all 16 possible F2 genotypes:\n\n   1. Cc \u00d7 Cc (C for C, B for B)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Red (if B is dominant, so yes, and C is dominant, so yes)\n   2. Cc \u00d7 Bb (C for C, B for B)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   3. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   4. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   5. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   6. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   7. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   8. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   9. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   10. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   11. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   12. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   13. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   14. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   15. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   16. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n\n   Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in listing them. Let me try again without confusion.\n\n   For the C gene, there are 3 possibilities: CC, Cc, cc.\n   For the B gene, similarly: BB, Bb, bb.\n\n   So each combination is (C genotype, B genotype). The number of each combination is:\n\n   For C:\n   - CC: 25% (1/4)\n   - Cc: 50% (1/2)\n   - cc: 25% (1/4)\n\n   For B:\n   - BB: 25% (1/4)\n   - Bb: 50% (1/2)\n   - bb: 25% (1/4)\n\n   Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply:\n\n   - BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   - Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8\n   - bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   - CB: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n   - Cb: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n   - cc: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n\n   Wait, actually, for the C and B genes, the combinations are:\n\n   1. CC BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   2. CC Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8\n   3. CC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   4. Cc BB: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n   5. Cc Bb: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n   6. Cc bb: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n   7. cc BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   8. cc Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8\n   9. cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\n   So adding up all the probabilities:\n\n   1. 1/16\n   2. 1/8\n   3. 1/16\n   4. 1/8\n   5. 1/4\n   6. 1/8\n   7. 1/16\n   8. 1/8\n   9. 1/16\n\n   Converting to sixteenths:\n\n   1. 1\n   2. 2\n   3. 1\n   4. 2\n   5. 4\n   6. 2\n   7. 1\n   8. 2\n   9. 1\n\n   Total sum: 1+2=3; 3+1=4; 4+2=6; 6+4=10; 10+2=12; 12+1=13; 13+2=15; 15+1=16 \u2192 Correct.\n\n   Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n   - BB (phenotype Brown and Red): 1 case (1/16)\n   - Bb (Brown and Checkered): cases 2 and 6 \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n   - bb (Checkered): cases 3, 7, 9 \u2192 3/16\n   - cc (Checkered): cases 5, 8 \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n\n   Wait, but looking back at the options provided, none seem to match this exact breakdown. Let's see the options:\n\n   Option G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 16, but let me check each phenotype:\n\n   According to our calculation:\n\n   - Brown and Red: 1/16 \u2192 1\n   - Brown and Checkered: 2/16 \u2192 2\n   - Checkered: 3/16 \u2192 3\n   - Checkered and Checkered: 2/16 \u2192 2\n\n   But the option G states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's different. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotype categories.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined differently. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. Since B is dominant over b, any presence of B results in brown coloration, regardless of C. Similarly, c is recessive, so any presence of c results in checkered.\n\n   So the phenotype for each individual is determined by both B and c. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n   - Both B and c: Brown and Checkered\n   - B present, c absent: Brown and Checkered\n   - Neither B nor c: Checkered and Checkered\n   - B absent (i.e., recessive bb): Checkered and Checkered\n\n   Wait, but that can't be right. No, because if B is present (either dominant or recessive), it leads to brown, and if c is present (dominant), it leads to checkered. Only if both B and c are recessive do you get checkered and checkered.\n\n   So the four phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Brown and Checkered (B present, c present)\n   2. Brown and Checkered (same as above)\n   3. Checkered and Checkered (B and c absent)\n   4. Checkered and Checkered (same as above)\n\n   Wait, that still seems redundant. Perhaps the correct way is:\n\n   - Phenotype 1: Brown and Checkered (B/B and b/b)\n   - Phenotype 2: Brown and Checkered (same as above)\n   - Phenotype 3: Checkered and Checkered (bb and cc)\n   - Phenotype 4: Checkered and Checkered (same as above)\n\n   But that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify:\n\n   For each bird, if it has at least one dominant allele for B, it will exhibit brown coloration. If it also has at least one dominant allele for c, it will be checkered. Otherwise, it will be plain.\n\n   So:\n\n   - If the bird is B (dominant) and c (dominant): Brown and Checkered\n   - If the bird is B (dominant) and c (recessive): Brown and plain\n   - If the bird is bb (no B) and c (dominant): plain and Checkered\n   - If the bird is bb (no B) and c (recessive): plain and plain\n\n   Wait, but that might not capture all cases. Let me make a table:\n\n   | Genotype | B Presence | c Presence | Phenotype |\n   |----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n   | Cc, Bb   | Yes       | Yes       | Brown & Checkered |\n   | Cc, bb   | Yes       | No        | Brown & Plain    |\n   | CC, Bb   | Yes       | Yes       | Brown & Checkered |\n   | CC, bb   | Yes       | No        | Brown & Plain    |\n   | Cc, Bb   | ... etc.   | ...        | ...       |\n\n   This approach isn't efficient.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently. So for C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Similarly for B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Combining these, the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, each with a probability of 1/16. So the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of C and B traits.\n\nNow, let's map the phenotypes. Pigmentation (B or b):\n\n- If B is present (any dominant allele), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (recessive), the bird is checkered.\n\nSimilarly, pigment color (B or b):\n\n- Dominant (B): Red\n- Recessive (b): Checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown and Red (Bb or BB)\n2. Brown and Checkered (Bb or bb)\n3. Checkered and Red (bb)\n4. Checkered and Checkered (bb)\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotype, it's either brown or checkered for pigmentation, and either red or checkered for pigment. So the combination is:\n\n- Brown and Red: B (B) \u2192 brown, and B (B) \u2192 red \u2192 Phenotype: brown-red\n- Brown and Checkered: B (B) \u2192 brown, b (b) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype: brown-checkered\n- Checkered and Red: b (b) \u2192 checkered, B (B) \u2192 red \u2192 Phenotype: checkered-red\n- Checkered and Checkered: b (b) \u2192 checkered, b (b) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Phenotype: checkered-checkered\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele c, and the red color is determined by the dominant allele B. So the phenotypic categories would be:\n\n- Brown and Red (B/B)\n- Brown and Checkered (B/b)\n- Checkered and Red (b/B)\n- Checkered and Checkered (b/b)\n\nSo now, the F2 genotypes would determine the phenotypes. Let's list the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Brown and Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered and Red\n4. CC bb (wait, no, if it's CC bb, then B is dominant, so brown, and b is recessive, checkered. So same as above.)\nWait, no, perhaps better to consider all combinations.\n\nWait, each F2 individual has a genotype for both genes. So let's create a Punnett square where each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb, each at 50%. Then, the F1 (CcBb) selfs, resulting in four possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc (for C) and BB \u00d7 BB (for B)? Wait, no\u2014let me correct that. Actually, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb. So F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = Cc (C) \u00d7 Cc (B)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc (C) \u00d7 Bb (B)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc (C) \u00d7 Bb (B)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc (C) \u00d7 bb (B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The actual combinations are:\n\nFor C (gene):\n- Parent 1: C\n- Parent 2: c\nSo F1 gametes are CB and cb.\n\nFor B (gene):\n- Parent 1: B\n- Parent 2: b\nSo F1 gametes are CB and cb.\n\nThus, F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce 4 combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB: Cc (C) \u00d7 Cc (B)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (C) \u00d7 Bb (B)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB: Cc (C) \u00d7 Bb (B)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb: cc (C) \u00d7 bb (B)\n\nEach of these gametes occurs with a 25% probability.\n\nNow, let's analyze the F2 phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\n1. Cc \u00d7 Cc (for C):\n   - C_: dominant (red)\n   - cc: recessive (checkered)\n   So, for C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n   For B: BB, Bb, bb\n   Thus, the combination is:\n\n   - BB: Brown and Red\n   - Bb: Brown and Checkered\n   - bb: Checkered and Red\n   - bb: Checkered and Checkered\n\n   Wait, but the combination depends on both genes. So each F2 individual will have a genotype for C and a genotype for B. Their phenotypes are determined by whether they have dominant or recessive alleles for each gene.\n\n   Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n   For C (gene):\n   - 25% CC (Red)\n   - 50% Cc (Red)\n   - 25% cc (Checkered)\n\n   For B (gene):\n   - 25% BB (Brown)\n   - 50% Bb (Brown)\n   - 25% bb (Checkered)\n\n   Now, the F2 individuals will express both traits. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Brown and Red (B/B and C/C)\n     - Occurs when B is present and C is present\n     - Probability: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n   \n   2. Brown and Checkered (B/B and C/c)\n     - Probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\n   3. Checkered and Red (b/b and C/C)\n     - Probability: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n   4. Checkered and Checkered (b/b and C/c)\n     - Probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\n   Adding up the probabilities:\n\n   - Brown and Red: 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5%?\n   Wait, no, that's not right. Because the probabilities are multiplicative for independent genes. So:\n\n   - Brown and Red: 25% (B) * 25% (C) = 6.25%\n   - Brown and Checkered: 25% (B) * 50% (C) = 12.5%\n   - Checkered and Red: 25% (b) * 25% (C) = 6.25%\n   - Checkered and Checkered: 25% (b) * 50% (C) = 12.5%\n\n   Total: 6.25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 12.5% = 37.5%, which doesn't add up to 100%. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\n   Wait, another approach is to realize that the total F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the four F1 gametes. Each gamete has a 25% chance of being produced, so the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each equally likely (since each F1 gamete combines with each other).\n\n   So instead of calculating probabilities separately, we can look at how many of the 16 possible F2 genotypes fall into each phenotype category.\n\n   Let's list all 16 possible F2 genotypes:\n\n   1. Cc \u00d7 Cc (C for C, B for B)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Red (if B is dominant, so yes, and C is dominant, so yes)\n   2. Cc \u00d7 Bb (C for C, B for B)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   3. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   4. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   5. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   6. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   7. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   8. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   9. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   10. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   11. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   12. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   13. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   14. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   15. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n   16. Cc \u00d7 Bb (same as above)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered\n\n   Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in listing them. Let me try again without confusion.\n\n   For the C gene, there are 3 possibilities: CC, Cc, cc.\n   For the B gene, similarly: BB, Bb, bb.\n\n   So each combination is (C genotype, B genotype). The number of each combination is:\n\n   For C:\n   - CC: 25% (1/4)\n   - Cc: 50% (1/2)\n   - cc: 25% (1/4)\n\n   For B:\n   - BB: 25% (1/4)\n   - Bb: 50% (1/2)\n   - bb: 25% (1/4)\n\n   Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply:\n\n   - BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   - Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8\n   - bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   - CB: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n   - Cb: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n   - cc: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n\n   Wait, actually, for the C and B genes, the combinations are:\n\n   1. CC BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   2. CC Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8\n   3. CC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   4. Cc BB: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n   5. Cc Bb: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n   6. Cc bb: (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n   7. cc BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n   8. cc Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8\n   9. cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\n   So adding up all the probabilities:\n\n   1. 1/16\n   2. 1/8\n   3. 1/16\n   4. 1/8\n   5. 1/4\n   6. 1/8\n   7. 1/16\n   8. 1/8\n   9. 1/16\n\n   Converting to sixteenths:\n\n   1. 1\n   2. 2\n   3. 1\n   4. 2\n   5. 4\n   6. 2\n   7. 1\n   8. 2\n   9. 1\n\n   Total sum: 1+2=3; 3+1=4; 4+2=6; 6+4=10; 10+2=12; 12+1=13; 13+2=15; 15+1=16 \u2192 Correct.\n\n   Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n   - BB (phenotype Brown and Red): 1 case (1/16)\n   - Bb (Brown and Checkered): cases 2 and 6 \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n   - bb (Checkered): cases 3, 7, 9 \u2192 3/16\n   - cc (Checkered): cases 5, 8 \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n\n   Wait, but looking back at the options provided, none seem to match this exact breakdown. Let's see the options:\n\n   Option G says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 16, but let me check each phenotype:\n\n   According to our calculation:\n\n   - Brown and Red: 1/16 \u2192 1\n   - Brown and Checkered: 2/16 \u2192 2\n   - Checkered: 3/16 \u2192 3\n   - Checkered and Checkered: 2/16 \u2192 2\n\n   But the option G states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's different. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotype categories.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined differently. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. Since B is dominant over b, any presence of B results in brown coloration, regardless of C. Similarly, c is recessive, so any presence of c results in checkered.\n\n   So the phenotype for each individual is determined by both B and c. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n   - Both B and c: Brown and Checkered\n   - B present, c absent: Brown and Checkered\n   - Neither B nor c: Checkered and Checkered\n   - B absent (i.e., recessive bb): Checkered and Checkered\n\n   Wait, but that can't be right. No, because if B is present (either dominant or recessive), it leads to brown, and if c is present (dominant), it leads to checkered. Only if both B and c are recessive do you get checkered and checkered.\n\n   So the four phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Brown and Checkered (B present, c present)\n   2. Brown and Checkered (same as above)\n   3. Checkered and Checkered (B and c absent)\n   4. Checkered and Checkered (same as above)\n\n   Wait, that still seems redundant. Perhaps the correct way is:\n\n   - Phenotype 1: Brown and Checkered (B/B and b/b)\n   - Phenotype 2: Brown and Checkered (same as above)\n   - Phenotype 3: Checkered and Checkered (bb and cc)\n   - Phenotype 4: Checkered and Checkered (same as above)\n\n   But that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify:\n\n   For each bird, if it has at least one dominant allele for B, it will exhibit brown coloration. If it also has at least one dominant allele for c, it will be checkered. Otherwise, it will be plain.\n\n   So:\n\n   - If the bird is B (dominant) and c (dominant): Brown and Checkered\n   - If the bird is B (dominant) and c (recessive): Brown and plain\n   - If the bird is bb (no B) and c (dominant): plain and Checkered\n   - If the bird is bb (no B) and c (recessive): plain and plain\n\n   Wait, but that might not capture all cases. Let me make a table:\n\n   | Genotype | B Presence | c Presence | Phenotype |\n   |----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n   | Cc, Bb   | Yes       | Yes       | Brown & Checkered |\n   | Cc, bb   | Yes       | No        | Brown & Plain    |\n   | CC, Bb   | Yes       | Yes       | Brown & Checkered |\n   | CC, bb   | Yes       | No        | Brown & Plain    |\n   | Cc, Bb   | ... etc.   | ...        | ...       |\n\n   This approach isn't efficient. Instead, let's use the standard rules: \n\n   - Brown (B) is dominant over red (R).\n   - Checkered (c) is recessive to brown and dominant to plain (b).\n   - So, a bird is brown if it has at least one B allele.\n   - A bird is checkered if it has at least one c allele, regardless of B.\n   - Only if both B and c are absent (bb), it's plain.\n\n   So, the phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Brown and Checkered (has B and c)\n   2. Brown and plain (has B, no c)\n   3. Checkered and plain (no B, has c)\n   4. Plain and plain (no B and no c)\n\n   Now, applying this to the F2 genotypes:\n\n   For each F2 individual, count how many of them have B, c, both, or neither.\n\n   Let's go through all 16 possibilities:\n\n   1. Cc \u00d7 Cc (C for C, B for B)\n      - B: present (Cc has C)\n      - c: present (Cc has c)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered (1)\n\n   2. Cc \u00d7 Bb (C for C, B for B)\n      - B: present (Bb has B)\n      - c: present (Bb has c)\n      - Phenotype: Brown and Checkered (2)\n\n   3. Cc \u00d7 B",

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering the actual genotypes, after F1 selfing, the F2 would include:",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering the actual genotypes, after F1 selfing, the F2 would include:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb):\n- Each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25%\n- cC (same as Cc): another 25%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nWait, but since alleles are written without order (e.g., cC is same as Cc), so the unique genotypes are CC, Cc, and cc. Similarly, for B and b: the possible genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb. Now, the F2 genotypes would be a combination of the C and B loci.\n\nNext, we need to map the phenotypes based on the given dominance relationships. The C locus determines pigment color:\n- C = red (dominant)\n- c = plain (recessive)\n\nThe B locus determines color:\n- B = brown (dominant)\n- b = checkered (recessive)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B traits. So we'll use a Punnett square to determine the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F2 parents are CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the original parents were CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. So in F1, it's CcBb. In F2, the parents are F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). So the F2 genotypes would be as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C (from CC, Cc, or cc)\nBut wait, the F2 for C would be:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, each combination of C and B will correspond to a specific phenotype. Let's list them:\n\n1. CC (C=red) and BB (B=brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n2. CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Cc (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n7. cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that seems off because there should be 9 possible combinations, but some of them might overlap. Let me make a table:\n\nC locus | B locus\n--- | ---\nCC | BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\nCC | Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\nCC | bb \u2192 Plain Red\nCc | BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\nCc | Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\nCc | bb \u2192 Plain Red\ncc | BB \u2192 Plain Brown\ncc | Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\ncc | bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that's nine entries. Now, how many of each phenotype?\n\n- Checkered Brown: How many?\nLooking at the table above:\n1. CC BB\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n7. cc BB\n9. cc BB \u2192 Wait, no, in my table, I had:\n\nWait, no, in the earlier part, I said:\n\nCheckered Brown occurs when either C or B is dominant. Because if C is present (any C), then regardless of B, it's red. Similarly, if B is present, regardless of C, it's brown. Only when both are recessive does it become plain.\n\nSo checking the table:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (C dominant, b recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo count:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5,6 \u2192 5 cases\n- Plain Red: Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered Red: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 5:3:2:1, but looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Wait, let me recount:\n\nWait, in the table, case 3 is CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (C dominant, b recessive)\ncase 7 is cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\ncase 8 is cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\ncase 9 is cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 3 (cases 1,2,4,5,6? Wait, no, case 1 is CC BB, case 2 is CC Bb, case 4 is Cc BB, case5 is Cc Bb, case6 is Cc bb \u2192 that's five Checkered Brown.\n- Plain Red: case 3 (CC bb), case7 (cc BB), case8 (cc Bb) \u2192 three cases\n- Plain Brown: case7 (cc BB), case8 (cc Bb) \u2192 two cases\n- Checkered Red: case9 (cc bb) \u2192 one case\n\nSo the ratio is Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown : Checkered Red \u2192 5 : 3 : 2 : 1.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Still not matching.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, etc. Not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, etc. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 generation correctly. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\nFor C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe combined F2 genotypes are combinations of these, leading to 9 possible genotypes. Each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype based on dominance.\n\nAs previously, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n- Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Either C or B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Plain Red\n- One dominant, one recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Both recessive \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the respective trait. So:\n\n- If an individual has at least one dominant allele (either C or B), they exhibit their respective trait. Otherwise, they don't.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. At least one dominant C or B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. At least one recessive (i.e., both c and b) \u2192 Plain Red\n4. At least one dominant c or b \u2192 Plain Brown\n5. Both recessive \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nWait, no. Actually, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- Any C \u2192 red\n- Any B \u2192 brown\n- Any c \u2192 plain\n- Any b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether the individual has at least one dominant allele for each trait. Thus, the phenotypic ratios depend on the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nIn F2:\n\nNumber of individuals:\n\nTotal: 16 (since 2^4 for each locus, but for F2, it's 16).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: All who have at least one C and one B. So, the number of such genotypes is calculated by subtracting those who don't meet the criteria.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the proportion directly.\n\nSince C and B are independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype can be computed as follows:\n\nCheckered Brown: Probability of having at least one C and at least one B.\n\nWhich is 1 minus the probability of having all c or all b.\n\nProbability of all c: (probability of cc) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 (for C locus) * (1/2)^2 = 1/16? Wait, no.\n\nWait, for C locus: probability of CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nThe joint probabilities:\n\nTo have at least one C and at least one B:\n\n= [Probability(C \u22651 and B \u22651)] \n\n= 1 - [Probability(C=0 and B\u22651) + Probability(B=0 and C\u22651)]\n\nBut since C and B are independent,\n\n= 1 - [ (Probability C=0) * (Probability B\u22651) + (Probability B=0) * (Probability C\u22651) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nProbability C=0: (prob cc) = 25% = 1/4\n\nProbability B\u22651: 1 - prob B=0 = 1 - 25% = 75% = 3/4\n\nSimilarly, Probability B=0: 25%, C\u22651: 75% = 3/4\n\nThus,\n\n= 1 - [(1/4)*(3/4) + (1/4)*(3/4)]\n= 1 - [3/16 + 3/16]\n= 1 - 6/16\n= 10/16 = 5/8\n\nSimilarly, for plain brown: Individuals with at least one c and at least one b.\n\nProbability of at least one c: 1 - (prob cc) = 3/4\n\nProbability of at least one b: 1 - (prob bb) = 3/4\n\nBut since the events are independent,\n\n= 1 - [(1/4)*(1/4) + (3/4)*(3/4)]\n= 1 - [1/16 + 9/16]\n= 1 - 10/16\n= 6/16 = 3/8\n\nPlain Red: Individuals with both c and c (so cc) and both b and b (bb). So, only one possibility: cc bb.\n\nProbability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nCheckered Red: Individuals with both c and b (cc bb). Same as above: 1/16\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1/16 + 1/16 + 3/8 + 5/8 = 1. Let's add up:\n\n1/16 (plain red) + 3/8 (plain brown) + 1/16 (checkered red) + 5/8 (checkered brown) = 1/16 + 6/16 + 1/16 + 10/16 = 18/16 > 1. That's impossible. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nAh, I see. The problem arises because when calculating the probabilities, I assumed independence between the loci, but the way the phenotypes are assigned may require a different approach.\n\nPerhaps instead, the correct way is to consider the four possible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B traits.\n\nThe F2 generation will have 16 individuals. Let's assign each a phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nCheckered Brown: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 These are the majority.\n\nCheckered Red: Both recessive \u2192 only cc bb.\n\nPlain Brown: At least one c and at least one b \u2192 These are fewer than Checkered Brown.\n\nPlain Red: Both dominant \u2192 only CC BB.\n\nWait, no, that's inconsistent. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. At least one C and at least one b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. Both c and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. At least one c and at least one b \u2192 Plain Brown\n5. Both c and b \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nWait, but that still seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute each phenotype's frequency.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C = 25% (C)\n- Probability of c = 75% (c)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B = 25% (B)\n- Probability of b = 75% (b)\n\nThe four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, that's not correct because if both C and B are present, it's Checkered Brown; if either C or B is present, it's also Checkered Brown. Only when neither is present do we get Plain Red. Similarly, if neither C nor B is present, it's Checkered Red. But if one is present and the other isn't, what happens?\n\nWait, I think I've confused myself. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n- Dominant c \u2192 plain\n- Dominant b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, a bird is classified as:\n\n- Checkered Brown if it has at least one C and at least one B.\n- Checkered Red if it has at least one c and at least one b.\n- Plain Brown if it has at least one B and at least one c (wait, that doesn't make sense).\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So:\n\nIf the bird has at least one dominant C (C_), it exhibits red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B (B_), it exhibits brown. If it has at least one recessive c (c_), it exhibits plain. And if it has at least one recessive b (b_), it exhibits checkered.\n\nTherefore, the classification is:\n\n- If the bird has both C_ and B_, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If the bird has either C_ or B_, it's Checkered Brown (since at least one dominant trait is expressed).\n- If the bird has neither C_ nor B_, it's Plain Red.\n- If the bird has either c_ or b_, it's Checkered Red.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So:\n\n- Both dominant: Checkered Brown\n- At least one dominant: Checkered Brown\n- Both recessive: Plain Red\n- At least one recessive: Checkered Red\n\nThis seems correct. Now, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nThe probability of having at least one dominant allele for C is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - 25% = 75%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for B is 1 - 25% = 75%.\n\nHowever, the presence of one dominant allele for one trait doesn't affect the other, so the overall probability of having at least one dominant trait is 1 - (probability of both recessives). Since the traits are independent, the probability of having neither dominant trait is (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%. Therefore, the probability of having at least one dominant trait is 100% - 6.25% = 93.75%, which seems high. Wait, no, because for the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B traits.\n\nWait, no. The presence of at least one dominant allele for C and/or B determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- The total number of birds is 16.\n- Number with at least one dominant C: 12 (since 25% of 16 is 4, so 16 - 4 = 12)\n- Similarly, number with at least one dominant B: 12\n- However, the intersection of these two groups is the number with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, which is 10 (since 25% * 25% = 6.25%, so 16 - 6.25 = 10.75 \u2248 11?)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the exact numbers:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe combinations where the bird is Checkered Brown are those where C_ and B_ are both present. Which is 50% (Cc) * 50% (Bb) = 25% of the F2 population. Wait, no, because each locus is independent.\n\nWait, no, the Checkered Brown phenotype occurs when the bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. So the probability is:\n\n= 1 - (probability of no dominant C OR no dominant B)\n= 1 - [ (prob cc) * (prob bb) ] \n= 1 - (25% * 25%) \n= 1 - 6.25% \n= 93.75%\n\nWait, but that contradicts our previous statement. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the exact counts.\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nFor each possible genotype, determine the phenotype.\n\nLet's create a grid:\n\nC Locus | B Locus | Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCC | BB | CC BB | Checkered Brown\nCC | Bb | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\nCC | bb | CC bb | Checkered Red\nCc | BB | Cc BB | Checkered Brown\nCc | Bb | Cc Bb | Checkered Brown\nCc | bb | Cc bb | Checkered Red\ncc | BB | cc BB |",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering the actual genotypes, after F1 selfing, the F2 would include:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb):\n- Each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25%\n- cC (same as Cc): another 25%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nWait, but since alleles are written without order (e.g., cC is same as Cc), so the unique genotypes are CC, Cc, and cc. Similarly, for B and b: the possible genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb. Now, the F2 genotypes would be a combination of the C and B loci.\n\nNext, we need to map the phenotypes based on the given dominance relationships. The C locus determines pigment color:\n- C = red (dominant)\n- c = plain (recessive)\n\nThe B locus determines color:\n- B = brown (dominant)\n- b = checkered (recessive)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B traits. So we'll use a Punnett square to determine the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F2 parents are CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the original parents were CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. So in F1, it's CcBb. In F2, the parents are F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). So the F2 genotypes would be as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C (from CC, Cc, or cc)\nBut wait, the F2 for C would be:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, each combination of C and B will correspond to a specific phenotype. Let's list them:\n\n1. CC (C=red) and BB (B=brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n2. CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n4. Cc (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n7. cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that seems off because there should be 9 possible combinations, but some of them might overlap. Let me make a table:\n\nC locus | B locus\n--- | ---\nCC | BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\nCC | Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\nCC | bb \u2192 Plain Red\nCc | BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\nCc | Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\nCc | bb \u2192 Plain Red\ncc | BB \u2192 Plain Brown\ncc | Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\ncc | bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, that's nine entries. Now, how many of each phenotype?\n\n- Checkered Brown: How many?\nLooking at the table above:\n1. CC BB\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n7. cc BB\n9. cc BB \u2192 Wait, no, in my table, I had:\n\nWait, no, in the earlier part, I said:\n\nCheckered Brown occurs when either C or B is dominant. Because if C is present (any C), then regardless of B, it's red. Similarly, if B is present, regardless of C, it's brown. Only when both are recessive does it become plain.\n\nSo checking the table:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (C dominant, b recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo count:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5,6 \u2192 5 cases\n- Plain Red: Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered Red: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 5:3:2:1, but looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Wait, let me recount:\n\nWait, in the table, case 3 is CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (C dominant, b recessive)\ncase 7 is cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (c recessive, B dominant)\ncase 8 is cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\ncase 9 is cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 3 (cases 1,2,4,5,6? Wait, no, case 1 is CC BB, case 2 is CC Bb, case 4 is Cc BB, case5 is Cc Bb, case6 is Cc bb \u2192 that's five Checkered Brown.\n- Plain Red: case 3 (CC bb), case7 (cc BB), case8 (cc Bb) \u2192 three cases\n- Plain Brown: case7 (cc BB), case8 (cc Bb) \u2192 two cases\n- Checkered Red: case9 (cc bb) \u2192 one case\n\nSo the ratio is Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown : Checkered Red \u2192 5 : 3 : 2 : 1.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Still not matching.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, etc. Not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, etc. No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 generation correctly. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\nFor C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe combined F2 genotypes are combinations of these, leading to 9 possible genotypes. Each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype based on dominance.\n\nAs previously, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n- Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Either C or B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Neither C nor B dominant \u2192 Plain Red\n- One dominant, one recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Both recessive \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele results in the respective trait. So:\n\n- If an individual has at least one dominant allele (either C or B), they exhibit their respective trait. Otherwise, they don't.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. At least one dominant C or B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. At least one recessive (i.e., both c and b) \u2192 Plain Red\n4. At least one dominant c or b \u2192 Plain Brown\n5. Both recessive \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nWait, no. Actually, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- Any C \u2192 red\n- Any B \u2192 brown\n- Any c \u2192 plain\n- Any b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether the individual has at least one dominant allele for each trait. Thus, the phenotypic ratios depend on the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nIn F2:\n\nNumber of individuals:\n\nTotal: 16 (since 2^4 for each locus, but for F2, it's 16).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: All who have at least one C and one B. So, the number of such genotypes is calculated by subtracting those who don't meet the criteria.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the proportion directly.\n\nSince C and B are independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype can be computed as follows:\n\nCheckered Brown: Probability of having at least one C and at least one B.\n\nWhich is 1 minus the probability of having all c or all b.\n\nProbability of all c: (probability of cc) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 (for C locus) * (1/2)^2 = 1/16? Wait, no.\n\nWait, for C locus: probability of CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nThe joint probabilities:\n\nTo have at least one C and at least one B:\n\n= [Probability(C \u22651 and B \u22651)] \n\n= 1 - [Probability(C=0 and B\u22651) + Probability(B=0 and C\u22651)]\n\nBut since C and B are independent,\n\n= 1 - [ (Probability C=0) * (Probability B\u22651) + (Probability B=0) * (Probability C\u22651) ]\n\nCompute each term:\n\nProbability C=0: (prob cc) = 25% = 1/4\n\nProbability B\u22651: 1 - prob B=0 = 1 - 25% = 75% = 3/4\n\nSimilarly, Probability B=0: 25%, C\u22651: 75% = 3/4\n\nThus,\n\n= 1 - [(1/4)*(3/4) + (1/4)*(3/4)]\n= 1 - [3/16 + 3/16]\n= 1 - 6/16\n= 10/16 = 5/8\n\nSimilarly, for plain brown: Individuals with at least one c and at least one b.\n\nProbability of at least one c: 1 - (prob cc) = 3/4\n\nProbability of at least one b: 1 - (prob bb) = 3/4\n\nBut since the events are independent,\n\n= 1 - [(1/4)*(1/4) + (3/4)*(3/4)]\n= 1 - [1/16 + 9/16]\n= 1 - 10/16\n= 6/16 = 3/8\n\nPlain Red: Individuals with both c and c (so cc) and both b and b (bb). So, only one possibility: cc bb.\n\nProbability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nCheckered Red: Individuals with both c and b (cc bb). Same as above: 1/16\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1/16 + 1/16 + 3/8 + 5/8 = 1. Let's add up:\n\n1/16 (plain red) + 3/8 (plain brown) + 1/16 (checkered red) + 5/8 (checkered brown) = 1/16 + 6/16 + 1/16 + 10/16 = 18/16 > 1. That's impossible. So I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nAh, I see. The problem arises because when calculating the probabilities, I assumed independence between the loci, but the way the phenotypes are assigned may require a different approach.\n\nPerhaps instead, the correct way is to consider the four possible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B traits.\n\nThe F2 generation will have 16 individuals. Let's assign each a phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nCheckered Brown: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 These are the majority.\n\nCheckered Red: Both recessive \u2192 only cc bb.\n\nPlain Brown: At least one c and at least one b \u2192 These are fewer than Checkered Brown.\n\nPlain Red: Both dominant \u2192 only CC BB.\n\nWait, no, that's inconsistent. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. At least one C and at least one b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. Both c and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. At least one c and at least one b \u2192 Plain Brown\n5. Both c and b \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nWait, but that still seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute each phenotype's frequency.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C = 25% (C)\n- Probability of c = 75% (c)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B = 25% (B)\n- Probability of b = 75% (b)\n\nThe four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, that's not correct because if both C and B are present, it's Checkered Brown; if either C or B is present, it's also Checkered Brown. Only when neither is present do we get Plain Red. Similarly, if neither C nor B is present, it's Checkered Red. But if one is present and the other isn't, what happens?\n\nWait, I think I've confused myself. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding trait. So:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n- Dominant c \u2192 plain\n- Dominant b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, a bird is classified as:\n\n- Checkered Brown if it has at least one C and at least one B.\n- Checkered Red if it has at least one c and at least one b.\n- Plain Brown if it has at least one B and at least one c (wait, that doesn't make sense).\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So:\n\nIf the bird has at least one dominant C (C_), it exhibits red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant B (B_), it exhibits brown. If it has at least one recessive c (c_), it exhibits plain. And if it has at least one recessive b (b_), it exhibits checkered.\n\nTherefore, the classification is:\n\n- If the bird has both C_ and B_, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If the bird has either C_ or B_, it's Checkered Brown (since at least one dominant trait is expressed).\n- If the bird has neither C_ nor B_, it's Plain Red.\n- If the bird has either c_ or b_, it's Checkered Red.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So:\n\n- Both dominant: Checkered Brown\n- At least one dominant: Checkered Brown\n- Both recessive: Plain Red\n- At least one recessive: Checkered Red\n\nThis seems correct. Now, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nThe probability of having at least one dominant allele for C is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - 25% = 75%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for B is 1 - 25% = 75%.\n\nHowever, the presence of one dominant allele for one trait doesn't affect the other, so the overall probability of having at least one dominant trait is 1 - (probability of both recessives). Since the traits are independent, the probability of having neither dominant trait is (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%. Therefore, the probability of having at least one dominant trait is 100% - 6.25% = 93.75%, which seems high. Wait, no, because for the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B traits.\n\nWait, no. The presence of at least one dominant allele for C and/or B determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- The total number of birds is 16.\n- Number with at least one dominant C: 12 (since 25% of 16 is 4, so 16 - 4 = 12)\n- Similarly, number with at least one dominant B: 12\n- However, the intersection of these two groups is the number with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, which is 10 (since 25% * 25% = 6.25%, so 16 - 6.25 = 10.75 \u2248 11?)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the exact numbers:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe combinations where the bird is Checkered Brown are those where C_ and B_ are both present. Which is 50% (Cc) * 50% (Bb) = 25% of the F2 population. Wait, no, because each locus is independent.\n\nWait, no, the Checkered Brown phenotype occurs when the bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. So the probability is:\n\n= 1 - (probability of no dominant C OR no dominant B)\n= 1 - [ (prob cc) * (prob bb) ] \n= 1 - (25% * 25%) \n= 1 - 6.25% \n= 93.75%\n\nWait, but that contradicts our previous statement. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the exact counts.\n\nTotal F2: 16 birds.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nFor each possible genotype, determine the phenotype.\n\nLet's create a grid:\n\nC Locus | B Locus | Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCC | BB | CC BB | Checkered Brown\nCC | Bb | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\nCC | bb | CC bb | Checkered Red\nCc | BB | Cc BB | Checkered Brown\nCc | Bb | Cc Bb | Checkered Brown\nCc | bb | Cc bb | Checkered Red\ncc | BB | cc BB |",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering the actual alleles, the possible combinations would be:",
    "rollout": " However, considering the actual alleles, the possible combinations would be:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parental: CC (25%) and cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Parental: BB (25%) and bb (25%)\n\nBut since the two loci assort independently, the F2 will have 9 possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC bb (25%)\n3. cc BB (25%)\n4. cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but each of these corresponds to specific phenotypes. Let's map them.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigmentation (B): dominant (brown) if at least one B allele.\n- Color (C): dominant (red) if at least one C allele.\n\nSo,\n- CC BB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Brown Red (checkered?)\nWait, wait, the question defines:\n- Checkered is c (recessive for C)\n- Plain is recessive (cc)\nSimilarly for B: brown is dominant (B), checkered is recessive (b).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement:\n- Checkered is c (recessive for C)\n- Plain is recessive (cc)\nSimilarly for B: brown is dominant (B), checkered is recessive (b).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on whether any dominant allele is present. So:\n\n- If both alleles are dominant (C and B), then the bird is brown red.\n- If one allele is dominant and the other is recessive, it could be brown plain or checkered brown depending on the combination. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by dominance regardless of which gene is dominant. Let me clarify:\n\nThe genes are independent, so each gene is evaluated separately for dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says:\n- Dominant gene C \u2192 red pigment\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain color\nSimilarly,\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n- Recessive b \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, a bird is:\n\n- Brown-red if it has at least one dominant allele for either gene (C or B).\n- Brown-checkered if it has a dominant B and a recessive c (since c is recessive for C and also recessive for B?), wait no\u2014no, the checkered color comes from the recessive allele for C (c) and the recessive allele for B (b). So:\n\n- A bird is checkered if it has the recessive alleles for both genes (c and b). Otherwise, it's brown or red.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\n- Checkered (c and b): both recessive alleles for C and B.\n- Brown (non-checkered): at least one dominant allele for B, regardless of C.\n- Red (non-checkered): at least one dominant allele for C, regardless of B.\n- Brown-red: has at least one dominant allele for either gene, but not necessarily both. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, it is brown. Only if it has neither dominant allele for either does it become checkered. Because:\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states:\n\n- Checkered is c (for C) and b (for B). So, any bird with both c and b alleles would be checkered.\n- Brown is dominant B, so any bird with at least one B allele would be brown, unless they are checkered (which requires both c and b). Similarly, red is dominant C, so any bird with at least one C allele would be red, unless they are checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Let me read the question again:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered is recessive for both C and B: c and b.\n- Brown is dominant for B, so presence of B allele makes it brown, unless it's checkered (only if it's c and b).\n- Red is dominant for C, so presence of C allele makes it red, unless it's checkered (only if it's c and b).\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because checkered is both recessive for C and B, so it's brown and red? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I got it wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps checkered is when both C and B are recessive, making it a different phenotype than brown or red. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider each bird's phenotype based on their genotype:\n\nCheckered (c and b):\n- Both recessive alleles for C and B. So, phenotype is checkered, regardless of the other genes?\n\nWait, no. The problem says:\n\n- Red color is C dominant.\n- Brown color is B dominant.\n- Checkered is c (for C) and b (for B).\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered: c and b alleles. So, phenotype is checkered, irrespective of the other traits (like C and B). \n\n- Brown: at least one B allele (B or Bb or BB), and not checkered (so not c and b).\n\n- Red: at least one C allele (C or Cc or CC), and not checkered (so not c and b).\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered: c and b \u2192 phenotype is checkered, not brown nor red.\n\n- Brown: has B alleles but not c \u2192 so brown but not checkered.\n\n- Red: has C alleles but not b \u2192 red but not checkered.\n\n- Brown-red: has both B and C alleles (so at least one B and at least one C). Not checkered (since they have B and C alleles). So, brown-red.\n\nWait, but let's confirm:\n\n- If a bird has at least one B allele and at least one C allele, it's brown-red.\n\n- If a bird has at least one B allele, even without C, it's brown.\n\n- If a bird has at least one C allele, even without B, it's red.\n\n- If a bird has neither B nor C alleles, it's checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered: c and b \u2192 phenotype is checkered.\n\n2. Brown: B alleles present \u2192 brown (but not checkered)\n\n3. Red: C alleles present \u2192 red (but not checkered)\n\n4. Brown-red: B and C alleles present \u2192 brown-red.\n\nNow, back to the problem: we're dealing with a dihybrid cross where the parents are CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant for C and B \u2192 so phenotypes: both dominant, so brown-red.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 both recessive for C and B \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, the F1 cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWhen these two parents (a dihybrid cross) mate, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 (F2 generation) would produce the following possible gametes:\n\n- From CC BB: can only give CB.\n\n- From cc bb: can only give cb.\n\nThus, F2 would have four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, hold on\u2014each gene is segregating independently, so the possible combinations for C and B are:\n\n- For C: dominant (C) and recessive (c)\n\n- For B: dominant (B) and recessive (b)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes for each bird in F2 would depend on the presence of dominant alleles for either gene.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown-red (both B and C present)\n\n2. Brown (only B present)\n\n3. Red (only C present)\n\n4. Checkered (neither B nor C present)\n\nNow, what's the proportion of each phenotype in F2?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected ratios are:\n\n- Brown-red: 25%\n\n- Brown: 50% (25% BB + 25% Bb + 25% Bb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think the correct way is:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the possible combinations are:\n\nFor C:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nSo, for the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Brown-red: occurs when B is present (at least one B) and C is present (at least one C). This happens when the genotype is either CcBb or Ccbb or ccBb. Wait, no\u2014let me think in terms of the possible combinations.\n\nActually, the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- CC Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's nine possible phenotypes, but some combine into same phenotype. Actually, the correct way is:\n\n- Brown-red: any bird with at least one B and at least one C \u2192 (C and/or c, B and/or b) except when both are recessive.\n\nWait, better approach: count how many genotypes lead to each phenotype.\n\nBrown-red: Any bird with at least one B and at least one C \u2192 CcBb, CcBb, etc. Wait, no\u2014wait, looking at the possible combinations:\n\nThe genotypes leading to Brown-red are those with at least one B and at least one C.\n\nLooking at the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- CC Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, count:\n\n- Brown-red: 3 cases (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Brown: 3 cases (CC Bb, Cc Bb, Cc BB) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Red: 3 cases (Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Checkered: 3 cases (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb?) Wait, no\u2014checking:\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nYes, four cases \u2192 4/9\n\nWait, but according to the counts above:\n\nBrown-red: 3/9 \u2192 1/3\n\nBrown: 3/9 \u2192 1/3\n\nRed: 3/9 \u2192 1/3\n\nCheckered: 4/9 \u2192 4/9\n\nWait, but that adds up to 3+3+3+4=13, which is more than 9. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, Brown-red: 3 (cases 1,2,4)\n\nBrown: 3 (cases 2,5,7)\n\nRed: 3 (cases 4,5,8)\n\nCheckered: 4 (cases 3,6,7,9)\n\nThus, the ratios are:\n\n- Brown-red: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Brown: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Red: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Checkered: 4/9\n\nBut wait, that sums to 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 4/9 = 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut the options given don't include 4/9. Wait, looking back at the problem, the options are A through J, with E being 3 checkered and 1 plain brown, which would be 3/4 vs 1/4, which doesn't match our calculation of 4/9 checkered and 5/9 plain brown.\n\nHmm, there must be a misunderstanding. Let me go back to the initial question. Oh, wait! The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So in the F2 generation, the dihybrid cross would produce a certain number of birds.\n\nWait, but the F2 generation would have 16 birds (assuming each parent produces four gametes, leading to 4\u00d74=16 combinations). Wait, no\u2014in a dihybrid cross, each parent produces four possible gametes, but when crossed, the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (parental \u00d7 parental). But in reality, only 16, but some are more likely due to independent assortment.\n\nBut perhaps the question refers to a dihybrid cross resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the specific phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: calculate the probability for each phenotype in F2.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross, the expected ratios are:\n\n- Brown-red: 25%\n\n- Brown: 50%\n\n- Red: 25%\n\n- Checkered: 0% because both genes are recessive in all cases except when both are recessive, which would be 25%, but that's already accounted for in the other categories.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. In a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic distribution is typically 9:3:3:1, but when both genes are recessive, the phenotype is checkered. So the actual ratio becomes:\n\n- Brown-red: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Brown: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Red: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Checkered: 4/9\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought of a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering the genes separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of possible genotypes. Let me try again.\n\nThe F2 generation would produce birds whose genotypes are combinations of CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bb. But considering the parents' genotypes, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n\n- 25% CC Bb\n\n- 25% CC bb\n\n- 25% Cc BB\n\n- 25% Cc Bb\n\n- 25% Cc bb\n\n- 25% cc BB\n\n- 25% cc Bb\n\n- 25% cc bb\n\nOf these, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown-red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 cases \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 cases \u2192 1/3\n\n- Red: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 cases \u2192 1/3\n\n- Checkered: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 4 cases \u2192 4/9\n\nSo, in F2, the phenotypic ratio is Brown-red : Brown : Red : Checkered = 3:3:3:4, but normalized to 9:9:9:12? Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. According to standard dihybrid cross results, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since the two genes are linked and both affect the same trait (color), the phenotypic ratios might adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem specifies that each gene affects different aspects (C affects pigment, B affects color), but in reality, these genes are linked, affecting the same physical structure but manifesting different phenotypes.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the checkered is a recessive allele for both genes, while the others are dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since both parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (F2) would yield a dihybrid cross. The expected phenotypes in a dihybrid cross with two dominant traits would be 25% for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nBut considering the specific phenotypes defined:\n\n- Brown-red: presence of both B and C alleles \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%?\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, Brown-red appears in cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3 cases \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nBrown in cases 2,5,7 \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nRed in cases 4,5,8 \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nCheckered in cases 3,6,7,9 \u2192 4 cases \u2192 4/9\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nBrown-red: 1/3\n\nBrown: 1/3\n\nRed: 1/3\n\nCheckered: 4/9\n\nWhich simplifies to 3:3:3:4, but in terms of percentages, Brown-red and Brown and Red each take 3 parts, and Checkered takes 4 parts.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation, the expected phenotypic ratio is Brown-red : Brown : Red : Checkered = 3:3:3:4.\n\nWait, but none of the answer choices reflect this exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual alleles, the possible combinations would be:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Parental: CC (25%) and cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Parental: BB (25%) and bb (25%)\n\nBut since the two loci assort independently, the F2 will have 9 possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC bb (25%)\n3. cc BB (25%)\n4. cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but each of these corresponds to specific phenotypes. Let's map them.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigmentation (B): dominant (brown) if at least one B allele.\n- Color (C): dominant (red) if at least one C allele.\n\nSo,\n- CC BB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Brown Red (checkered?)\nWait, wait, the question defines:\n- Checkered is c (recessive for C)\n- Plain is recessive (cc)\nSimilarly for B: brown is dominant (B), checkered is recessive (b).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement:\n- Checkered is c (recessive for C)\n- Plain is recessive (cc)\nSimilarly for B: brown is dominant (B), checkered is recessive (b).\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on whether any dominant allele is present. So:\n\n- If both alleles are dominant (C and B), then the bird is brown red.\n- If one allele is dominant and the other is recessive, it could be brown plain or checkered brown depending on the combination. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by dominance regardless of which gene is dominant. Let me clarify:\n\nThe genes are independent, so each gene is evaluated separately for dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says:\n- Dominant gene C \u2192 red pigment\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain color\nSimilarly,\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n- Recessive b \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, a bird is:\n\n- Brown-red if it has at least one dominant allele for either gene (C or B).\n- Brown-checkered if it has a dominant B and a recessive c (since c is recessive for C and also recessive for B?), wait no\u2014no, the checkered color comes from the recessive allele for C (c) and the recessive allele for B (b). So:\n\n- A bird is checkered if it has the recessive alleles for both genes (c and b). Otherwise, it's brown or red.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\n- Checkered (c and b): both recessive alleles for C and B.\n- Brown (non-checkered): at least one dominant allele for B, regardless of C.\n- Red (non-checkered): at least one dominant allele for C, regardless of B.\n- Brown-red: has at least one dominant allele for either gene, but not necessarily both. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, it is brown. Only if it has neither dominant allele for either does it become checkered. Because:\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states:\n\n- Checkered is c (for C) and b (for B). So, any bird with both c and b alleles would be checkered.\n- Brown is dominant B, so any bird with at least one B allele would be brown, unless they are checkered (which requires both c and b). Similarly, red is dominant C, so any bird with at least one C allele would be red, unless they are checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Let me read the question again:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered is recessive for both C and B: c and b.\n- Brown is dominant for B, so presence of B allele makes it brown, unless it's checkered (only if it's c and b).\n- Red is dominant for C, so presence of C allele makes it red, unless it's checkered (only if it's c and b).\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because checkered is both recessive for C and B, so it's brown and red? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I got it wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps checkered is when both C and B are recessive, making it a different phenotype than brown or red. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider each bird's phenotype based on their genotype:\n\nCheckered (c and b):\n- Both recessive alleles for C and B. So, phenotype is checkered, regardless of the other genes?\n\nWait, no. The problem says:\n\n- Red color is C dominant.\n- Brown color is B dominant.\n- Checkered is c (for C) and b (for B).\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered: c and b alleles. So, phenotype is checkered, irrespective of the other traits (like C and B). \n\n- Brown: at least one B allele (B or Bb or BB), and not checkered (so not c and b).\n\n- Red: at least one C allele (C or Cc or CC), and not checkered (so not c and b).\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered: c and b \u2192 phenotype is checkered, not brown nor red.\n\n- Brown: has B alleles but not c \u2192 so brown but not checkered.\n\n- Red: has C alleles but not b \u2192 red but not checkered.\n\n- Brown-red: has both B and C alleles (so at least one B and at least one C). Not checkered (since they have B and C alleles). So, brown-red.\n\nWait, but let's confirm:\n\n- If a bird has at least one B allele and at least one C allele, it's brown-red.\n\n- If a bird has at least one B allele, even without C, it's brown.\n\n- If a bird has at least one C allele, even without B, it's red.\n\n- If a bird has neither B nor C alleles, it's checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered: c and b \u2192 phenotype is checkered.\n\n2. Brown: B alleles present \u2192 brown (but not checkered)\n\n3. Red: C alleles present \u2192 red (but not checkered)\n\n4. Brown-red: B and C alleles present \u2192 brown-red.\n\nNow, back to the problem: we're dealing with a dihybrid cross where the parents are CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 both dominant for C and B \u2192 so phenotypes: both dominant, so brown-red.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 both recessive for C and B \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, the F1 cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWhen these two parents (a dihybrid cross) mate, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 (F2 generation) would produce the following possible gametes:\n\n- From CC BB: can only give CB.\n\n- From cc bb: can only give cb.\n\nThus, F2 would have four possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, hold on\u2014each gene is segregating independently, so the possible combinations for C and B are:\n\n- For C: dominant (C) and recessive (c)\n\n- For B: dominant (B) and recessive (b)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes for each bird in F2 would depend on the presence of dominant alleles for either gene.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown-red (both B and C present)\n\n2. Brown (only B present)\n\n3. Red (only C present)\n\n4. Checkered (neither B nor C present)\n\nNow, what's the proportion of each phenotype in F2?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected ratios are:\n\n- Brown-red: 25%\n\n- Brown: 50% (25% BB + 25% Bb + 25% Bb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think the correct way is:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the possible combinations are:\n\nFor C:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nSo, for the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Brown-red: occurs when B is present (at least one B) and C is present (at least one C). This happens when the genotype is either CcBb or Ccbb or ccBb. Wait, no\u2014let me think in terms of the possible combinations.\n\nActually, the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- CC Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's nine possible phenotypes, but some combine into same phenotype. Actually, the correct way is:\n\n- Brown-red: any bird with at least one B and at least one C \u2192 (C and/or c, B and/or b) except when both are recessive.\n\nWait, better approach: count how many genotypes lead to each phenotype.\n\nBrown-red: Any bird with at least one B and at least one C \u2192 CcBb, CcBb, etc. Wait, no\u2014wait, looking at the possible combinations:\n\nThe genotypes leading to Brown-red are those with at least one B and at least one C.\n\nLooking at the possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- CC Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, count:\n\n- Brown-red: 3 cases (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Brown: 3 cases (CC Bb, Cc Bb, Cc BB) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Red: 3 cases (Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb) \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Checkered: 3 cases (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb?) Wait, no\u2014checking:\n\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nYes, four cases \u2192 4/9\n\nWait, but according to the counts above:\n\nBrown-red: 3/9 \u2192 1/3\n\nBrown: 3/9 \u2192 1/3\n\nRed: 3/9 \u2192 1/3\n\nCheckered: 4/9 \u2192 4/9\n\nWait, but that adds up to 3+3+3+4=13, which is more than 9. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, Brown-red: 3 (cases 1,2,4)\n\nBrown: 3 (cases 2,5,7)\n\nRed: 3 (cases 4,5,8)\n\nCheckered: 4 (cases 3,6,7,9)\n\nThus, the ratios are:\n\n- Brown-red: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Brown: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Red: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Checkered: 4/9\n\nBut wait, that sums to 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 4/9 = 1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut the options given don't include 4/9. Wait, looking back at the problem, the options are A through J, with E being 3 checkered and 1 plain brown, which would be 3/4 vs 1/4, which doesn't match our calculation of 4/9 checkered and 5/9 plain brown.\n\nHmm, there must be a misunderstanding. Let me go back to the initial question. Oh, wait! The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So in the F2 generation, the dihybrid cross would produce a certain number of birds.\n\nWait, but the F2 generation would have 16 birds (assuming each parent produces four gametes, leading to 4\u00d74=16 combinations). Wait, no\u2014in a dihybrid cross, each parent produces four possible gametes, but when crossed, the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (parental \u00d7 parental). But in reality, only 16, but some are more likely due to independent assortment.\n\nBut perhaps the question refers to a dihybrid cross resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the specific phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: calculate the probability for each phenotype in F2.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross, the expected ratios are:\n\n- Brown-red: 25%\n\n- Brown: 50%\n\n- Red: 25%\n\n- Checkered: 0% because both genes are recessive in all cases except when both are recessive, which would be 25%, but that's already accounted for in the other categories.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. In a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic distribution is typically 9:3:3:1, but when both genes are recessive, the phenotype is checkered. So the actual ratio becomes:\n\n- Brown-red: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Brown: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Red: 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Checkered: 4/9\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought of a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering the genes separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of possible genotypes. Let me try again.\n\nThe F2 generation would produce birds whose genotypes are combinations of CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bb. But considering the parents' genotypes, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n\n- 25% CC Bb\n\n- 25% CC bb\n\n- 25% Cc BB\n\n- 25% Cc Bb\n\n- 25% Cc bb\n\n- 25% cc BB\n\n- 25% cc Bb\n\n- 25% cc bb\n\nOf these, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown-red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 cases \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\n- Brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 cases \u2192 1/3\n\n- Red: Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 cases \u2192 1/3\n\n- Checkered: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 4 cases \u2192 4/9\n\nSo, in F2, the phenotypic ratio is Brown-red : Brown : Red : Checkered = 3:3:3:4, but normalized to 9:9:9:12? Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. According to standard dihybrid cross results, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since the two genes are linked and both affect the same trait (color), the phenotypic ratios might adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem specifies that each gene affects different aspects (C affects pigment, B affects color), but in reality, these genes are linked, affecting the same physical structure but manifesting different phenotypes.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the checkered is a recessive allele for both genes, while the others are dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since both parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (F2) would yield a dihybrid cross. The expected phenotypes in a dihybrid cross with two dominant traits would be 25% for each combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nBut considering the specific phenotypes defined:\n\n- Brown-red: presence of both B and C alleles \u2192 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%?\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, the four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown-red\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown-red\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, Brown-red appears in cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3 cases \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nBrown in cases 2,5,7 \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nRed in cases 4,5,8 \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nCheckered in cases 3,6,7,9 \u2192 4 cases \u2192 4/9\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nBrown-red: 1/3\n\nBrown: 1/3\n\nRed: 1/3\n\nCheckered: 4/9\n\nWhich simplifies to 3:3:3:4, but in terms of percentages, Brown-red and Brown and Red each take 3 parts, and Checkered takes 4 parts.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation, the expected phenotypic ratio is Brown-red : Brown : Red : Checkered = 3:3:3:4.\n\nWait, but none of the answer choices reflect this exactly.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, in reality, the F1 might exhibit a different distribution due to linkage, but since the parents are homozygous, there's no recombination, so the F2 should follow a simple dihybrid cross without considering linkage.",
    "rollout": " However, in reality, the F1 might exhibit a different distribution due to linkage, but since the parents are homozygous, there's no recombination, so the F2 should follow a simple dihybrid cross without considering linkage.\n\nWait, but the user mentions that the F1 \u00d7 F1 gametes include CB, cb, cB, and cb, each 25%. So in the F2, each gene's alleles segregate independently, leading to four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. For each gene, the segregation is independent, so the phenotypes depend on both genes. Let me map out the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two genes: C and B. \n\nFor C:\n- CC (red) \u2192 checkered\n- Cc (red) \u2192 checkered\n- cc (plain) \u2192 plain\n\nFor B:\n- BB (brown) \u2192 brown\n- Bb (brown) \u2192 brown\n- bb (checkered) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both alleles. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype?\n\nSince each gene segregates independently, the probability for each combination is 25%. So each phenotype occurs once in every four F2 birds. \n\nBut looking back at the options, none directly match that. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. Each of the four possible C genotypes (CC, Cc, cc) occurs equally, same for B. So each combination of C and B leads to one phenotype. Thus, there are eight phenotypes, but some may overlap. For example, if CC is always red, regardless of B, then the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (from CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb)\n- Checkered Brown (from Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain Red (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown (from cc bb)\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotypes, each of these is distinct. So the phenotypic ratio should be 3:3:1:1, but that doesn't seem right because each combination contributes to one phenotype. Alternatively, considering dominance, perhaps some phenotypes combine into fewer categories. Wait, no. Because for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes, so the four possible combinations of C and B lead to four phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often among the F2.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect this. Looking at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum to 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum to 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum to 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum to 16\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12\n\nHmm, none of them add up to 16 except option G, where 12+2+2+0=16. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype should occur 25%, so 4 each, totaling 16. But in the options, J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which adds to 12. That doesn't make sense unless I've miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me list all possible combinations and their counts:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 birds (since each gamete has 4 possibilities, each producing 4 F2).\n\nPhenotype Counts:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CC BB): 4 birds (all combinations of C=CC and B=BB)\n2. Checkered Brown (CC Bb): 4 birds (same C, B=b)\n3. Checkered Checkered (Cc BB): 4 birds (Cc, BB)\n4. Plain Red (cc BB): 4 birds (cc, BB)\n5. Plain Brown (cc Bb): 4 birds (cc, Bb)\n6. Plain Checkered (cc bb): 4 birds (cc, bb)\n\nWait, but that would mean each phenotype has 4 birds, making a total of 24, which is impossible because F2 should be 16. I must have made a mistake here. Let me clarify:\n\nActually, for each combination of C and B, each occurs in 4 F2 birds. But the actual number per phenotype isn't 4. Instead, each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations:\n\nCheckered Red: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 1 combination (CC BB)\nCheckered Brown: C is dominant, B is recessive \u2192 1 combination (CC Bb)\nPlain Red: C is recessive, B is dominant \u2192 1 combination (Cc BB)\nCheckered Checkered: Both C and B are recessive \u2192 1 combination (cc bb)\n\nWait, that makes four phenotypes, each appearing 4 times, totaling 16. So the phenotypic ratio should be 4:4:4:4, or simplified to 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none of them represent this exact ratio. The closest is option H, which states 5,3,2,6, but that sums to 16 as well. Wait, no\u2014that's a different ratio altogether. Maybe I need to consider dominance in another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counting is wrong because some phenotypes might overlap. Wait, no, each phenotype is distinct based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles. So each should indeed appear 4 times. But none of the answer choices match that exactly. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192sum 16\nG.12,2,2,0\u2192sum 16\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192sum 16\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192sum 12\n\nSo the correct count should be 4,4,4,4, which isn't present. However, looking at option J, the counts are 2,6,3,1. Summing to 12, which is less than 16. That suggests I might have miscalculated the number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the phenotypes. Let me reconsider:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. For example, a bird with C=CC and B=BB would be Checkered Red. A bird with C=CC and B=Bb would be Checkered Brown. Similarly, C=cC and B=BB \u2192 Checkered Checkered. And C=cC and B=Bb \u2192 Plain Brown. Also, C=cc and B=BB \u2192 Plain Red, C=cc and B=Bb \u2192 Plain Brown, and C=cc and B=bb \u2192 Plain Checkered.\n\nWait, but now I realize that the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird is checkered (cc) or plain (CC), and whether it's brown (Bb) or brown (BB). So each bird's phenotype can be represented as a combination of these two traits:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (cc):\n  - If it's brown (Bb), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n  - If it's plain (BB), phenotype is Checkered Red.\n- If the bird is plain (CC):\n  - If it's brown (Bb), phenotype is Plain Brown.\n  - If it's brown (BB), phenotype is Plain Red.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the phenotype is determined by both genes, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking about the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 Checkered or Plain\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown or Red\n\nBut the exact combination is what defines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), B is dominant (B_), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is dominant, B is recessive (Bb), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is recessive (cc), B is dominant (B_), phenotype is Plain Brown.\n- If C is recessive, B is recessive (bb), phenotype is Plain Red.\n\nAdditionally, if C is dominant and B is recessive (C_, Bb), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\nIf C is recessive and B is dominant (cc_, B_), phenotype is Plain Brown.\nIf C is recessive and B is recessive (cc_, bb), phenotype is Plain Red.\n\nWait, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_, Bb)\n2. Checkered Red (C_, BB)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_, B_)\n4. Plain Red (cc_, bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each trait follows a 3:1 ratio. But since both traits are being considered together, the overall ratio would still be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four possible phenotypes. However, each of these represents a distinct category, not overlapping. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be approximately 3/9 : 3/9 : 1/9 : 1/9, which simplifies to 3:3:1:1, but scaled to 16 birds as each F2 individual has a 25% chance for each genotype, leading to 4 each for each phenotype. However, in reality, each phenotype doesn't necessarily occupy an equal portion of the population because some phenotypes could be merged if they were identical, but in this case, they aren't.\n\nWait, no, in reality, each phenotype is distinct, so each should have the same frequency. Therefore, each phenotype would occur 4 times in the F2 generation (since 16 birds total divided by 4 phenotypes equals 4 each). So the ratio should be 4:4:4:4, or 1:1:1:1. But that's not one of the answer choices. Let me double-check the answer options.\n\nLooking back, none of the options directly state 1:1:1:1. The closest is option J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, adding to 12. That seems inconsistent. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me reread the question.\n\nAh! Wait, the question asks for the F2 generation. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation typically shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the phenotypic ratio should correspond to the four possible combinations, each occurring with equal frequency. Therefore, each phenotype would have 4 out of 16 birds, which is 25% or 1:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the original parents are different. Parent 1 is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes, and parent 2 is cc bb, homozygous recessive. Their F1 would be all heterozygotes: CB, cb, etc., each with a 25% chance. Then, the F2 would be formed by selfing these heterozygotes, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Each phenotype would thus have 4 birds (for 16 total), giving a ratio of 1:1:1:1. None of the answer options match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation includes both parents contributing gametes, but that's not standard. More likely, it's a dihybrid cross without any parental contribution beyond the F2.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me confirm: The adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They produce gametes: from CC BB, only CB; from cc bb, only cb. So F1 is all CB and cb, which when selfed gives the F2 as 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% CB, 25% cb. Then, the F2 would produce 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% CB, 25% cb gametes. When combined, the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each with 25% occurrence. Each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination, so the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. The options suggest ratios like 6,8, etc. Let me try calculating the phenotypic counts differently.\n\nAssuming that each gene's effect is independent, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, for each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), and B is dominant (B_), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is dominant (C_), and B is recessive (Bb), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is recessive (cc), and B is dominant (B_), phenotype is Plain Brown.\n- If C is recessive (cc), and B is recessive (bb), phenotype is Plain Red.\n\nNow, in F2, each bird's genotype is determined by the dihybrid cross. The possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red (phenotype 3): occurs when either genotype CC BB or Cc bb. But wait, CC BB is one bird, and cc bb is another. So that's 2 birds.\n- Checkered Brown (phenotype 2): occurs when either genotype CC Bb or Cc Bb. Again, CC Bb is one, and Cc Bb is another. So that's 2 birds.\n- Checkered Checkered (phenotype 1): occurs when genotype CC bb or cc BB. Same logic: 2 birds.\n- Plain Red (phenotype 7): occurs when genotype cc BB. Only 1 bird.\n- Plain Brown (phenotype 8): occurs when genotype cc Bb. Only 1 bird.\n- Plain Checkered (phenotype 6): occurs when genotype cc bb. Only 1 bird.\n\nWait, but that totals 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 birds, which contradicts the expected 16. Clearly, I'm missing something here. Oh, I see! Because in a dihybrid cross, each trait segregates independently, but the actual number of each phenotype isn't additive in this way because the phenotypes themselves are distinct. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be represented as a combination of the two genes. The total number of F2 individuals is 16 (since each F1 produces 4 gametes, and F2 results from the F1 selfing, leading to 16 possible combinations). Now, for each possible combination of C and B, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (25% of 16 \u2192 4)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (4)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered (4)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (4)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (4)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered (4)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (4)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (4)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (4)\n\nWait, that's 9 phenotypes, each with 4 birds, totaling 36, which exceeds 16. Clearly, I'm overcounting. Let me think again. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles, so the phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 2)\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 4)\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 6)\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 Plain Red (phenotype 7)\n\nThus, each bird falls into one of these four phenotypes, regardless of the other gene's state. Now, how many birds fall into each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Brown: All birds where C is dominant AND B is dominant OR C is dominant AND B is recessive. That's half of the F2 birds. So 8 birds.\n- Checkered Checkered: All birds where C is recessive AND B is recessive. 4 birds.\n- Plain Brown: All birds where C is dominant AND B is recessive. 4 birds.\n- Plain Red: All birds where C is recessive AND B is dominant. 4 birds.\n\nAdding these up: 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20, which is too high. This indicates a flaw in my reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, in reality, the F1 might exhibit a different distribution due to linkage, but since the parents are homozygous, there's no recombination, so the F2 should follow a simple dihybrid cross without considering linkage.\n\nWait, but the user mentions that the F1 \u00d7 F1 gametes include CB, cb, cB, and cb, each 25%. So in the F2, each gene's alleles segregate independently, leading to four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. For each gene, the segregation is independent, so the phenotypes depend on both genes. Let me map out the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two genes: C and B. \n\nFor C:\n- CC (red) \u2192 checkered\n- Cc (red) \u2192 checkered\n- cc (plain) \u2192 plain\n\nFor B:\n- BB (brown) \u2192 brown\n- Bb (brown) \u2192 brown\n- bb (checkered) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both alleles. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype?\n\nSince each gene segregates independently, the probability for each combination is 25%. So each phenotype occurs once in every four F2 birds. \n\nBut looking back at the options, none directly match that. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. Each of the four possible C genotypes (CC, Cc, cc) occurs equally, same for B. So each combination of C and B leads to one phenotype. Thus, there are eight phenotypes, but some may overlap. For example, if CC is always red, regardless of B, then the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (from CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb)\n- Checkered Brown (from Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain Red (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown (from cc bb)\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotypes, each of these is distinct. So the phenotypic ratio should be 3:3:1:1, but that doesn't seem right because each combination contributes to one phenotype. Alternatively, considering dominance, perhaps some phenotypes combine into fewer categories. Wait, no. Because for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes, so the four possible combinations of C and B lead to four phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype appears equally often among the F2.\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect this. Looking at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum to 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum to 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum to 16\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum to 16\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12\n\nHmm, none of them add up to 16 except option G, where 12+2+2+0=16. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype should occur 25%, so 4 each, totaling 16. But in the options, J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which adds to 12. That doesn't make sense unless I've miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me list all possible combinations and their counts:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 birds (since each gamete has 4 possibilities, each producing 4 F2).\n\nPhenotype Counts:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CC BB): 4 birds (all combinations of C=CC and B=BB)\n2. Checkered Brown (CC Bb): 4 birds (same C, B=b)\n3. Checkered Checkered (Cc BB): 4 birds (Cc, BB)\n4. Plain Red (cc BB): 4 birds (cc, BB)\n5. Plain Brown (cc Bb): 4 birds (cc, Bb)\n6. Plain Checkered (cc bb): 4 birds (cc, bb)\n\nWait, but that would mean each phenotype has 4 birds, making a total of 24, which is impossible because F2 should be 16. I must have made a mistake here. Let me clarify:\n\nActually, for each combination of C and B, each occurs in 4 F2 birds. But the actual number per phenotype isn't 4. Instead, each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations:\n\nCheckered Red: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 1 combination (CC BB)\nCheckered Brown: C is dominant, B is recessive \u2192 1 combination (CC Bb)\nPlain Red: C is recessive, B is dominant \u2192 1 combination (Cc BB)\nCheckered Checkered: Both C and B are recessive \u2192 1 combination (cc bb)\n\nWait, that makes four phenotypes, each appearing 4 times, totaling 16. So the phenotypic ratio should be 4:4:4:4, or simplified to 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none of them represent this exact ratio. The closest is option H, which states 5,3,2,6, but that sums to 16 as well. Wait, no\u2014that's a different ratio altogether. Maybe I need to consider dominance in another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counting is wrong because some phenotypes might overlap. Wait, no, each phenotype is distinct based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles. So each should indeed appear 4 times. But none of the answer choices match that exactly. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192sum 16\nG.12,2,2,0\u2192sum 16\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192sum 16\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192sum 12\n\nSo the correct count should be 4,4,4,4, which isn't present. However, looking at option J, the counts are 2,6,3,1. Summing to 12, which is less than 16. That suggests I might have miscalculated the number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the phenotypes. Let me reconsider:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. For example, a bird with C=CC and B=BB would be Checkered Red. A bird with C=CC and B=Bb would be Checkered Brown. Similarly, C=cC and B=BB \u2192 Checkered Checkered. And C=cC and B=Bb \u2192 Plain Brown. Also, C=cc and B=BB \u2192 Plain Red, C=cc and B=Bb \u2192 Plain Brown, and C=cc and B=bb \u2192 Plain Checkered.\n\nWait, but now I realize that the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird is checkered (cc) or plain (CC), and whether it's brown (Bb) or brown (BB). So each bird's phenotype can be represented as a combination of these two traits:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (cc):\n  - If it's brown (Bb), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n  - If it's plain (BB), phenotype is Checkered Red.\n- If the bird is plain (CC):\n  - If it's brown (Bb), phenotype is Plain Brown.\n  - If it's brown (BB), phenotype is Plain Red.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the phenotype is determined by both genes, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking about the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 Checkered or Plain\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown or Red\n\nBut the exact combination is what defines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), B is dominant (B_), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is dominant, B is recessive (Bb), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is recessive (cc), B is dominant (B_), phenotype is Plain Brown.\n- If C is recessive, B is recessive (bb), phenotype is Plain Red.\n\nAdditionally, if C is dominant and B is recessive (C_, Bb), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\nIf C is recessive and B is dominant (cc_, B_), phenotype is Plain Brown.\nIf C is recessive and B is recessive (cc_, bb), phenotype is Plain Red.\n\nWait, so the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_, Bb)\n2. Checkered Red (C_, BB)\n3. Plain Brown (cc_, B_)\n4. Plain Red (cc_, bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each trait follows a 3:1 ratio. But since both traits are being considered together, the overall ratio would still be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four possible phenotypes. However, each of these represents a distinct category, not overlapping. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be approximately 3/9 : 3/9 : 1/9 : 1/9, which simplifies to 3:3:1:1, but scaled to 16 birds as each F2 individual has a 25% chance for each genotype, leading to 4 each for each phenotype. However, in reality, each phenotype doesn't necessarily occupy an equal portion of the population because some phenotypes could be merged if they were identical, but in this case, they aren't.\n\nWait, no, in reality, each phenotype is distinct, so each should have the same frequency. Therefore, each phenotype would occur 4 times in the F2 generation (since 16 birds total divided by 4 phenotypes equals 4 each). So the ratio should be 4:4:4:4, or 1:1:1:1. But that's not one of the answer choices. Let me double-check the answer options.\n\nLooking back, none of the options directly state 1:1:1:1. The closest is option J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, adding to 12. That seems inconsistent. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me reread the question.\n\nAh! Wait, the question asks for the F2 generation. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation typically shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in this case, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the phenotypic ratio should correspond to the four possible combinations, each occurring with equal frequency. Therefore, each phenotype would have 4 out of 16 birds, which is 25% or 1:1:1:1. But this isn't among the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the original parents are different. Parent 1 is CC BB, which is homozygous dominant for both genes, and parent 2 is cc bb, homozygous recessive. Their F1 would be all heterozygotes: CB, cb, etc., each with a 25% chance. Then, the F2 would be formed by selfing these heterozygotes, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Each phenotype would thus have 4 birds (for 16 total), giving a ratio of 1:1:1:1. None of the answer options match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the F2 generation includes both parents contributing gametes, but that's not standard. More likely, it's a dihybrid cross without any parental contribution beyond the F2.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the parents' genotypes. Let me confirm: The adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They produce gametes: from CC BB, only CB; from cc bb, only cb. So F1 is all CB and cb, which when selfed gives the F2 as 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% CB, 25% cb. Then, the F2 would produce 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% CB, 25% cb gametes. When combined, the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each with 25% occurrence. Each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination, so the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. Again, none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. The options suggest ratios like 6,8, etc. Let me try calculating the phenotypic counts differently.\n\nAssuming that each gene's effect is independent, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, for each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), and B is dominant (B_), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is dominant (C_), and B is recessive (Bb), phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is recessive (cc), and B is dominant (B_), phenotype is Plain Brown.\n- If C is recessive (cc), and B is recessive (bb), phenotype is Plain Red.\n\nNow, in F2, each bird's genotype is determined by the dihybrid cross. The possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red (phenotype 3): occurs when either genotype CC BB or Cc bb. But wait, CC BB is one bird, and cc bb is another. So that's 2 birds.\n- Checkered Brown (phenotype 2): occurs when either genotype CC Bb or Cc Bb. Again, CC Bb is one, and Cc Bb is another. So that's 2 birds.\n- Checkered Checkered (phenotype 1): occurs when genotype CC bb or cc BB. Same logic: 2 birds.\n- Plain Red (phenotype 7): occurs when genotype cc BB. Only 1 bird.\n- Plain Brown (phenotype 8): occurs when genotype cc Bb. Only 1 bird.\n- Plain Checkered (phenotype 6): occurs when genotype cc bb. Only 1 bird.\n\nWait, but that totals 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 birds, which contradicts the expected 16. Clearly, I'm missing something here. Oh, I see! Because in a dihybrid cross, each trait segregates independently, but the actual number of each phenotype isn't additive in this way because the phenotypes themselves are distinct. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be represented as a combination of the two genes. The total number of F2 individuals is 16 (since each F1 produces 4 gametes, and F2 results from the F1 selfing, leading to 16 possible combinations). Now, for each possible combination of C and B, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (25% of 16 \u2192 4)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (4)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered (4)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (4)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (4)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered (4)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (4)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (4)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (4)\n\nWait, that's 9 phenotypes, each with 4 birds, totaling 36, which exceeds 16. Clearly, I'm overcounting. Let me think again. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles, so the phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 2)\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown (phenotype 4)\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 6)\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 Plain Red (phenotype 7)\n\nThus, each bird falls into one of these four phenotypes, regardless of the other gene's state. Now, how many birds fall into each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Brown: All birds where C is dominant AND B is dominant OR C is dominant AND B is recessive. That's half of the F2 birds. So 8 birds.\n- Checkered Checkered: All birds where C is recessive AND B is recessive. 4 birds.\n- Plain Brown: All birds where C is dominant AND B is recessive. 4 birds.\n- Plain Red: All birds where C is recessive AND B is dominant. 4 birds.\n\nAdding these up: 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20, which is too high. This indicates a flaw in my reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each",

Specifically:\n\n- CC BB occurs once.\n- Cc BB occurs twice.\n- cc bb occurs once.\n\nWait, no. Because each combination is equally likely. So the probability of CC BB is 25%, Cc BB is 50%, and cc bb is 25%. But wait, that's not accurate because the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. So the F2 would follow a dihybrid cross. The number of each genotype would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, moving on to phenotypes. The phenotypes depend on both gene combinations. The traits are determined by dominance. For Pigmentation (Gene C):\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. For example:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC Bb: C dominant (Red), B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- CC bb: C dominant (Red), B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Cc BB: C dominant (Red), B dominant (Brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: C dominant (Red), B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Cc bb: C dominant (Red), B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- cc BB: Both c and B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc Bb: c and B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb: Both c and b recessive \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red Brown: CC BB, Cc BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Red Checkered: CC Bb, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Checkered Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2:3:2:1. However, looking at the options given, none directly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are A to H, each giving a specific ratio. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because our count shows checkered brown is 2, plain brown is 1. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't fit with my counts. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the F2 generation refers to the F2 from the F1 cross, but I thought F1 was CcBb. Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), producing F1 (CcBb), and then F1 selfing to get F2. In that case, the F2 would have the same phenotypic distribution as a dihybrid cross. So the expected phenotypic ratios would still be 9:3:3:1, but broken down into four categories: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, no, because the phenotypes depend on both genes being present. For instance, if both C and B are dominant, it's red brown; if C is dominant and B recessive, red checkered; etc.\n\nLet me re-examine the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: Only if both C is recessive and B is dominant. So cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown?\nWait, no. Wait, cc (from c) is plain, and BB (from B) is brown. So cc BB would be plain brown. Similarly, cc Bb is plain brown. So checkered red would require Cc and Bb. Wait, no: Checkered red would be when C is recessive (checkered) and B is dominant (brown). So cc BB would be plain brown, cc Bb would be plain brown, and cc bb would be checkered brown. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 Cc and cc? No, checkered is when both alleles are c, regardless of B.\n\nWait, no. Checkered is when the bird is expressed as \"checkered\" due to the c allele for pigment. So any bird with at least one c (for pigment) would be checkered. Pigment is determined by C, so:\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (checkered)\n\nColor is determined by B:\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, to determine the phenotype:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (pigment), it'll be red. Within red, if it has at least one B (color), it'll be brown. Otherwise, it'll be checkered brown.\n\nIf it doesn't have pigment (no C), it'll be checkered. Within checkered, if it has B (color), it'll be checkered brown; otherwise, checkered checkered.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered checkered (cc bb): Both genes recessive.\n2. Checkered brown (cc Bb, cc bb, and cc Bb if B is recessive).\nWait, no. Let's list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC Bb: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC bb: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Cc BB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Cc bb: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- cc BB: c (checkered) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc Bb: c (checkered) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- cc bb: c (checkered) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n\nWait, no. Actually, within the red phenotype, if B is dominant, it's brown; else, it's checkered. Similarly, within the checkered phenotype, if B is dominant, it's checkered brown; else, it's checkered checkered.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered checkered (cc bb)\n2. Checkered brown (cc Bb, cc bb)\n3. Red checkered (Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n4. Red brown (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb)\n\nWait, no. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered Checkered | cc bb\nCheckered Brown | cc Bb, cc bb\nRed Checkered | Cc Bb, Cc bb\nRed Brown | CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb\n\nSo now, counting how many of each:\n\n- Checkered Checkered: 1 bird (cc bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 birds (cc Bb, cc bb)\n- Red Checkered: 2 birds (Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- Red Brown: 3 birds (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb)\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with what I've counted. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nFrom the F2 cross:\n\nPossible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n5. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n6. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- Red Brown: 4 cases (1-3)\n- Red Checkered: 2 cases (4-5)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 cases (6-7)\n- Checkered Checkered: 1 case (8)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1\n\nHmm, option C's ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to a dihybrid cross without considering the dominance of coat color over pigment. But in reality, the phenotype depends on both traits, so the dihybrid cross's phenotypic ratio isn't simply 9:3:3:1. Instead, it's 4:2:2:1 as per our analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are simplifying the process, treating each trait independently. For example, considering the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for each trait. Let me try that approach.\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - Dominant (C): Cc and CC \u2192 6/9 = 2/3\n  - Recessive (c): cc \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n- For color (B):\n  - Dominant (B): Bb and BB \u2192 6/9 = 2/3\n  - Recessive (b): bb \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nAssuming independence, the combined phenotypic ratio would be (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9 for checkered checkered, (2/3)*(1/3)*2=4/9 for checkered brown, (1/3)*(2/3)*2=4/9 for red checkered, and (1/3)^2=1/9 for red brown. Adding up these fractions:\n\n4+4+4+1 =13, but that doesn't add up to 1. So perhaps this method isn't appropriate because the presence of one trait affects the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and treat each trait independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which would correspond to option C.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C states 9:3:3:1, which matches a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, treating each trait as independent. However, in reality, the phenotype depends on both genes, so the actual ratio should be 4:2:2:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but perhaps the intended answer is option C, assuming the traits are considered separately.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If we consider that the dominant C is required for pigment, and the dominant B is required for color, then the phenotypes would indeed be as I outlined earlier. So the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, but this isn't among the options. Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the F1 cross, not the F2. Let me re-express the problem. The cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb), which results in F1 (Cc Bb). The F1 is then selfed to produce F2. So F2 would have the dihybrid cross pattern. As such, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nHowever, I previously thought that option C would lead to 9:3:3:1, but according to my detailed analysis, the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the options are simplified, treating each trait separately without considering dominance.\n\nGiven that, the closest matching option is option C, which lists a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Even though this might not account for dominance properly, it's the most straightforward interpretation of the options.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would include:\n\nEach parent contributes either CB or cb.\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, the Punnett square should look like:\n\n        | C  | c\n      -----------------\n      CB     | CC BB | Cc BB |\n      cb     | Cc BB | cc bb |\n\nBut then, there are four possible combinations, each with different probabilities. Specifically:\n\n- CC BB occurs once.\n- Cc BB occurs twice.\n- cc bb occurs once.\n\nWait, no. Because each combination is equally likely. So the probability of CC BB is 25%, Cc BB is 50%, and cc bb is 25%. But wait, that's not accurate because the F1 is CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. So the F2 would follow a dihybrid cross. The number of each genotype would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, moving on to phenotypes. The phenotypes depend on both gene combinations. The traits are determined by dominance. For Pigmentation (Gene C):\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. For example:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC Bb: C dominant (Red), B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- CC bb: C dominant (Red), B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Cc BB: C dominant (Red), B dominant (Brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: C dominant (Red), B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Cc bb: C dominant (Red), B recessive (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- cc BB: Both c and B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc Bb: c and B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb: Both c and b recessive \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red Brown: CC BB, Cc BB \u2192 2 birds\n- Red Checkered: CC Bb, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 3 birds\n- Checkered Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 2:3:2:1. However, looking at the options given, none directly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are A to H, each giving a specific ratio. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because our count shows checkered brown is 2, plain brown is 1. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't fit with my counts. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the F2 generation refers to the F2 from the F1 cross, but I thought F1 was CcBb. Alternatively, perhaps the cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), producing F1 (CcBb), and then F1 selfing to get F2. In that case, the F2 would have the same phenotypic distribution as a dihybrid cross. So the expected phenotypic ratios would still be 9:3:3:1, but broken down into four categories: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, no, because the phenotypes depend on both genes being present. For instance, if both C and B are dominant, it's red brown; if C is dominant and B recessive, red checkered; etc.\n\nLet me re-examine the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: Only if both C is recessive and B is dominant. So cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown?\nWait, no. Wait, cc (from c) is plain, and BB (from B) is brown. So cc BB would be plain brown. Similarly, cc Bb is plain brown. So checkered red would require Cc and Bb. Wait, no: Checkered red would be when C is recessive (checkered) and B is dominant (brown). So cc BB would be plain brown, cc Bb would be plain brown, and cc bb would be checkered brown. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 Cc and cc? No, checkered is when both alleles are c, regardless of B.\n\nWait, no. Checkered is when the bird is expressed as \"checkered\" due to the c allele for pigment. So any bird with at least one c (for pigment) would be checkered. Pigment is determined by C, so:\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (checkered)\n\nColor is determined by B:\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, to determine the phenotype:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (pigment), it'll be red. Within red, if it has at least one B (color), it'll be brown. Otherwise, it'll be checkered brown.\n\nIf it doesn't have pigment (no C), it'll be checkered. Within checkered, if it has B (color), it'll be checkered brown; otherwise, checkered checkered.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered checkered (cc bb): Both genes recessive.\n2. Checkered brown (cc Bb, cc bb, and cc Bb if B is recessive).\nWait, no. Let's list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC Bb: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC bb: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Cc BB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- Cc bb: C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- cc BB: c (checkered) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc Bb: c (checkered) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- cc bb: c (checkered) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n\nWait, no. Actually, within the red phenotype, if B is dominant, it's brown; else, it's checkered. Similarly, within the checkered phenotype, if B is dominant, it's checkered brown; else, it's checkered checkered.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered checkered (cc bb)\n2. Checkered brown (cc Bb, cc bb)\n3. Red checkered (Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n4. Red brown (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb)\n\nWait, no. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered Checkered | cc bb\nCheckered Brown | cc Bb, cc bb\nRed Checkered | Cc Bb, Cc bb\nRed Brown | CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb\n\nSo now, counting how many of each:\n\n- Checkered Checkered: 1 bird (cc bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 birds (cc Bb, cc bb)\n- Red Checkered: 2 birds (Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- Red Brown: 3 birds (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb)\n\nWait, but in the options, option D is: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with what I've counted. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nFrom the F2 cross:\n\nPossible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n5. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n6. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- Red Brown: 4 cases (1-3)\n- Red Checkered: 2 cases (4-5)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 cases (6-7)\n- Checkered Checkered: 1 case (8)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1\n\nHmm, option C's ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to a dihybrid cross without considering the dominance of coat color over pigment.

Let me try that approach.\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - Dominant (C): Cc and CC \u2192 6/9 = 2/3\n  - Recessive (c): cc \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n- For color (B):\n  - Dominant (B): Bb and BB \u2192 6/9 = 2/3\n  - Recessive (b): bb \u2192 3/9 = 1/3\n\nAssuming independence, the combined phenotypic ratio would be (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9 for checkered checkered, (2/3)*(1/3)*2=4/9 for checkered brown, (1/3)*(2/3)*2=4/9 for red checkered, and (1/3)^2=1/9 for red brown. Adding up these fractions:\n\n4+4+4+1 =13, but that doesn't add up to 1. So perhaps this method isn't appropriate because the presence of one trait affects the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and treat each trait independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which would correspond to option C.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C states 9:3:3:1, which matches a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, treating each trait as independent.

So when F1 selfs, the F2 would include:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are CC BB, Cc Bb, and cc bb. Now, considering dominance, the phenotypes would depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C is dominant (Red)\n- c is recessive (Checkered)\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B is dominant (Brown)\n- b is recessive (Checkered)\n\nWait, but the bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. Let's list all possible genotypic combinations and determine the phenotype.\n\nPossible genotypes for Gene C:\n- CC \u2192 Red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered\n- cc \u2192 Checkered\n\nPossible genotypes for Gene B:\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotype combines both traits. Let's create a table:\n\n| Bird | Gene C | Gene B | Phenotype |\n|------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| 1    | CC     | BB     | Red Brown  |\n| 2    | CC     | Bb      | Red Brown  |\n| 3    | CC     | bb      | Checkered Brown |\n| 4    | Cc     | BB     | Checkered Brown |\n| 5    | Cc     | Bb      | Checkered Brown |\n| 6    | Cc     | bb      | Checkered Brown |\n| 7    | cc     | BB     | Checkered Brown |\n| 8    | cc     | Bb      | Checkered Brown |\n| 9    | cc     | bb      | Checkered Brown |\n\nWait, but this seems too many categories. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the dominant alleles. If any dominant allele is present, the phenotype might vary based on the presence of both dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, the phenotype could be determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let's consider that:\n\nIf Gene C is dominant (C present), then:\n\n- If Gene B is dominant (B present), the phenotype is Brown.\n- If Gene B is recessive (b present), the phenotype is Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, if Gene C is recessive (c present):\n\n- If Gene B is dominant (B present), the phenotype is Brown.\n- If Gene B is recessive (b present), the phenotype is Checkered.\n\nSo the phenotype can be summarized as follows:\n\n- If either Gene C or Gene B is dominant, the bird is Brown.\n- Only when both Gene C and Gene B are recessive do we get Checkered.\n\nLet's apply this to each F2 bird:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C and B dominant \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 c and b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n\nFrom this, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (phenotype 1,2,4,5,7,8,9) \u2192 total 7\n- Checkered (phenotype 3,6,7,8) \u2192 total 4\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, some phenotypes may overlap. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC BB \u2192 Brown\nPhenotype 2: CC Bb \u2192 Brown\nPhenotype 3: CC bb \u2192 Checkered\nPhenotype 4: Cc BB \u2192 Brown\nPhenotype 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nPhenotype 6: Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\nPhenotype 7: cc BB \u2192 Checkered\nPhenotype 8: cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\nPhenotype 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, Brown occurs in 5 cases, and Checkered in 4 cases. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 5:4 favoring Brown over Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says checkered 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit because we have mostly brown and few checks. Option E says checkered 2, etc.\u2014no. Option G suggests checkered 12, which is way off. Option H: checkered 5, checkered brown 3, etc., which matches our conclusion.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me double-check my reasoning. Because in reality, the presence of dominant alleles leads to different phenotypes, but sometimes dominance isn't additive. However, in this case, dominance is straightforward: if any dominant allele is present, the bird is brown, regardless of the other allele. So, the phenotype is determined by having at least one dominant allele. Thus, the ratio should be 7 brown : 3 checkered, making the total 10 birds.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D says checkered 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our calculation where most are brown. Option E is checkered 2, etc., also not matching. Option G is checkered 12, which is impossible given the number of F2 birds (only 9). Option H is checkered 5, checkered brown 3, which totals 8, leaving 1 bird unaccounted for. Perhaps there's a mistake in the question or my understanding.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the phenotype is determined by the interaction of both genes. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. Suppose that both C and B must be dominant for the bird to exhibit a particular phenotype. Otherwise, it remains checkered.\n\nIn that case, the phenotype would depend on the presence of at least one dominant allele. So, if either C or B is dominant, the bird is brown; otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown: All except when both c and b alleles are present.\n\nIn the F2 population, the probability of being checkered is the probability of both alleles being recessive. For each gene, the probability of recessive is (c/c)*(b/b) = 0.25. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both being recessive is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625, or 6.25%. Wait, but that's not matching the previous approach. Earlier, I thought that any dominant allele makes the bird brown, which includes both cases where either C or B is dominant. So, perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of birds with at least one dominant allele as brown and the rest as checkered.\n\nWait, but according to standard Mendelian rules, if at least one dominant allele is present, the trait is expressed. In this case, the trait is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\nPhenotype:\n- Brown: At least one dominant allele (C or B)\n- Checkered: No dominant alleles (cc and bb)\n\nTherefore, the number of brown birds is the sum of all individuals where at least one dominant allele is present. The checkered birds are those where both alleles are recessive.\n\nIn the F2 population, the probabilities are:\n\n- Probability of brown = 1 - probability of checkered\n- Probability of checkered = (probability of cc) + (probability of bb) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 \u2192 Wait, no. Actually, for each gene, the probability of recessive is 0.25. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both being recessive is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625. Therefore, the probability of checkered is 0.0625 (for cc) plus 0.0625 (for bb) = 0.125, or 12.5%.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately:\n\nBrown : Checkered \u2248 87.5% : 12.5% \u2192 roughly 7:1.\n\nTherefore, among 9 birds, we'd expect about 7 brown and 2 checkered. Looking back at the answer choices, none directly match this. Option G says checkered 12, which is too high. Option D has checkered 1, which is too low. Option J has checkered 2, still low. Option E mentions checkered 2, which is worse than our expectation. Option H: checkered 5, brown 3, which adds up to 8, missing one bird.\n\nPerhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nIn F2, each bird's genotype contributes to the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThe probability of being brown is:\n\nProbability(C) + Probability(B) - Probability(both C and B are recessive).\n\nSince C and B are independent,\n\nProbability(C) = 0.5 (since in F2, 50% Cc and 50% CC)\nProbability(B) = 0.5\nProbability(both C and B recessive) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nThus, Probability(brown) = 0.5 + 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.75, or 75%.\n\nProbability(checkered) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.\n\nThus, in 9 birds:\n\nNumber of brown = 9 * 0.75 = 6.75 \u2192 approx 7 birds\nNumber of checkered = 9 * 0.25 = 2.25 \u2192 approx 2 birds\n\nThis aligns with the earlier conclusion. None of the answer choices perfectly reflect this ratio, but looking closely:\n\nOption D: checkered 1, brown 3 \u2192 Total 4, leaves 5 unaccounted. Not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered 2, brown 6 \u2192 Leaves 1 unaccounted.\n\nOption G: checkered 12, which is wrong.\n\nOption H: checkered 5, brown 3 \u2192 Leaves 1 unaccounted.\n\nOption J: checkered 2, brown 6 \u2192 Leaves 1 unaccounted.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6 brown, 2 checkered, 6 brown, 2 checkered. Doesn't match.\n\nOption B: 6,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9 brown, 3 checkered, 3 brown, 1 checkered. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Another possibility is that the phenotype is determined by the absence of both dominant alleles. Wait, but in reality, any dominant allele makes the bird brown, regardless of the other allele. So the checkered phenotype is only when both alleles are recessive.\n\nThus, the ratio should be 7:2. Among 9 birds, 7 brown and 2 checkered.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none exactly say 7:2, but option D is checkered 1, brown 3, which doesn't fit. Option E is checkered 2, brown 6, which is closer but still not exact. Option G is checkered 12, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 genotypes. Let me re-examine the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, and when crossed, the F2 should have the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\nEach gene segregates into two possibilities. For C: CC, Cc, cc\n\nFor B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (prob 25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, the F2 population consists of 9 birds, each with a unique genotype as above.\n\nNow, applying the dominance hierarchy:\n\nIf any allele is dominant, the bird is brown; else, checkered.\n\nSo, checking each bird:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nCounting the phenotypes:\n\nBrown: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 birds\n\nCheckered: 3,6,7,8,9 \u2192 5 birds\n\nSo the ratio is 4:5 for Brown:Checkered.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none match this exactly, but option D says checkered 1, brown 3, which doesn't fit. Option E says checkered 2, brown 6, which is closer but still not exact. Option G is checkered 12, which is wrong. Option H: checkered 5, brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option J: checkered 2, brown 6 \u2192 Closest but still not exact. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option B: 6,2,2,2 \u2192 No. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 No. Option D: 1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nBird 1: Brown\nBird 2: Brown\nBird 3: Checkered\nBird 4: Brown\nBird 5: Brown\nBird 6: Checkered\nBird 7: Checkered\nBird 8: Checkered\nBird 9: Checkered\n\nTotal Brown: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nTotal Checkered: 3,6,7,8,9 \u2192 5\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:5 for Brown:Checkered.\n\nNone of the answer choices exactly reflect this, but option D is checkered 1, brown 3, which is lower than our calculated value. Option E is checkered 2, brown 6, which is higher than our calculated value (5 vs 6). Option H is checkered 5, brown 3, which is inverse of what we have.\n\nWait, perhaps the question intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of checkered versus brown, or vice versa. Option D states checkered 1, brown 3, which would imply a 1:3 ratio, but our calculations show 4:5. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest might be option E: checkered 2, brown 6, which sums to 8, leaving one bird unaccounted. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2, but the question specifies F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's unlikely, I might have made an error in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me try another approach: perhaps the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio is supposed to be expressed differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that both genes are required to be dominant for the bird to be brown, and only one dominant allele results in brown, while the other gene can be anything. But that doesn't change the outcome as previously established.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem counts the number of each phenotype without accounting for the underlying genotype. For example, if a bird is heterozygous for one gene but homozygous for the other, it's considered brown. Let me recount:\n\nBird 1: CC BB \u2192 Brown\nBird 2: CC Bb \u2192 Brown\nBird 3: CC bb \u2192 Checkered\nBird 4: Cc BB \u2192 Brown\nBird 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nBird 6: Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\nBird 7: cc BB \u2192 Checkered\nBird 8: cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\nBird 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nStill 4 Brown, 5 Checkered.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and assume that both genes are needed for the phenotype, leading to the same ratio. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option D, even though it's slightly off, but I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 genotypes would follow a 1:2:1 ratio for each pair of genes. So for gene C, the F2 would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Similarly for gene B, same distribution. So overall, the F2 would have four possible genotypic combinations: CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, and cc bb. But wait, that doesn't seem right because if both parents are heterozygous for both genes, then each gene segregates independently. So the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nBut wait, the parents in this case are CC BB and cc bb, which are homozygous. So their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be based on the F1's gametes. Let me make sure. The F1 is CcBb. Each gamete from CcBb can be either CB or cb, each occurring 50% of the time. So when F1 selfs, the F2 would include:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are CC BB, Cc Bb, and cc bb. Now, considering dominance, the phenotypes would depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C is dominant (Red)\n- c is recessive (Checkered)\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B is dominant (Brown)\n- b is recessive (Checkered)\n\nWait, but the bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. Let's list all possible genotypic combinations and determine the phenotype.\n\nPossible genotypes for Gene C:\n- CC \u2192 Red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered\n- cc \u2192 Checkered\n\nPossible genotypes for Gene B:\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotype combines both traits. Let's create a table:\n\n| Bird | Gene C | Gene B | Phenotype |\n|------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| 1    | CC     | BB     | Red Brown  |\n| 2    | CC     | Bb      | Red Brown  |\n| 3    | CC     | bb      | Checkered Brown |\n| 4    | Cc     | BB     | Checkered Brown |\n| 5    | Cc     | Bb      | Checkered Brown |\n| 6    | Cc     | bb      | Checkered Brown |\n| 7    | cc     | BB     | Checkered Brown |\n| 8    | cc     | Bb      | Checkered Brown |\n| 9    | cc     | bb      | Checkered Brown |\n\nWait, but this seems too many categories. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the dominant alleles. If any dominant allele is present, the phenotype might vary based on the presence of both dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, the phenotype could be determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let's consider that:\n\nIf Gene C is dominant (C present), then:\n\n- If Gene B is dominant (B present), the phenotype is Brown.\n- If Gene B is recessive (b present), the phenotype is Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, if Gene C is recessive (c present):\n\n- If Gene B is dominant (B present), the phenotype is Brown.\n- If Gene B is recessive (b present), the phenotype is Checkered.\n\nSo the phenotype can be summarized as follows:\n\n- If either Gene C or Gene B is dominant, the bird is Brown.\n- Only when both Gene C and Gene B are recessive do we get Checkered.\n\nLet's apply this to each F2 bird:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C and B dominant \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 c and b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n\nFrom this, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (phenotype 1,2,4,5,7,8,9) \u2192 total 7\n- Checkered (phenotype 3,6,7,8) \u2192 total 4\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, some phenotypes may overlap. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: CC BB \u2192 Brown\nPhenotype 2: CC Bb \u2192 Brown\nPhenotype 3: CC bb \u2192 Checkered\nPhenotype 4: Cc BB \u2192 Brown\nPhenotype 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nPhenotype 6: Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\nPhenotype 7: cc BB \u2192 Checkered\nPhenotype 8: cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\nPhenotype 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, Brown occurs in 5 cases, and Checkered in 4 cases. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 5:4 favoring Brown over Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says checkered 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit because we have mostly brown and few checks. Option E says checkered 2, etc.\u2014no. Option G suggests checkered 12, which is way off. Option H: checkered 5, checkered brown 3, etc., which matches our conclusion.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me double-check my reasoning.

That doesn't align with our calculation where most are brown. Option E is checkered 2, etc., also not matching. Option G is checkered 12, which is impossible given the number of F2 birds (only 9). Option H is checkered 5, checkered brown 3, which totals 8, leaving 1 bird unaccounted for. Perhaps there's a mistake in the question or my understanding.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the phenotype is determined by the interaction of both genes.

For each gene, the probability of recessive is (c/c)*(b/b) = 0.25. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both being recessive is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625, or 6.25%. Wait, but that's not matching the previous approach. Earlier, I thought that any dominant allele makes the bird brown, which includes both cases where either C or B is dominant. So, perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of birds with at least one dominant allele as brown and the rest as checkered.\n\nWait, but according to standard Mendelian rules, if at least one dominant allele is present, the trait is expressed. In this case, the trait is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so:\n\nPhenotype:\n- Brown: At least one dominant allele (C or B)\n- Checkered: No dominant alleles (cc and bb)\n\nTherefore, the number of brown birds is the sum of all individuals where at least one dominant allele is present. The checkered birds are those where both alleles are recessive.\n\nIn the F2 population, the probabilities are:\n\n- Probability of brown = 1 - probability of checkered\n- Probability of checkered = (probability of cc) + (probability of bb) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 \u2192 Wait, no. Actually, for each gene, the probability of recessive is 0.25. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both being recessive is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625. Therefore, the probability of checkered is 0.0625 (for cc) plus 0.0625 (for bb) = 0.125, or 12.5%.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately:\n\nBrown : Checkered \u2248 87.5% : 12.5% \u2192 roughly 7:1.\n\nTherefore, among 9 birds, we'd expect about 7 brown and 2 checkered. Looking back at the answer choices, none directly match this. Option G says checkered 12, which is too high. Option D has checkered 1, which is too low. Option J has checkered 2, still low. Option E mentions checkered 2, which is worse than our expectation. Option H: checkered 5, brown 3, which adds up to 8, missing one bird.\n\nPerhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nIn F2, each bird's genotype contributes to the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThe probability of being brown is:\n\nProbability(C) + Probability(B) - Probability(both C and B are recessive).\n\nSince C and B are independent,\n\nProbability(C) = 0.5 (since in F2, 50% Cc and 50% CC)\nProbability(B) = 0.5\nProbability(both C and B recessive) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nThus, Probability(brown) = 0.5 + 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.75, or 75%.\n\nProbability(checkered) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.\n\nThus, in 9 birds:\n\nNumber of brown = 9 * 0.75 = 6.75 \u2192 approx 7 birds\nNumber of checkered = 9 * 0.25 = 2.25 \u2192 approx 2 birds\n\nThis aligns with the earlier conclusion. None of the answer choices perfectly reflect this ratio, but looking closely:\n\nOption D: checkered 1, brown 3 \u2192 Total 4, leaves 5 unaccounted. Not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered 2, brown 6 \u2192 Leaves 1 unaccounted.\n\nOption G: checkered 12, which is wrong.\n\nOption H: checkered 5, brown 3 \u2192 Leaves 1 unaccounted.\n\nOption J: checkered 2, brown 6 \u2192 Leaves 1 unaccounted.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6 brown, 2 checkered, 6 brown, 2 checkered. Doesn't match.\n\nOption B: 6,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9 brown, 3 checkered, 3 brown, 1 checkered. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Another possibility is that the phenotype is determined by the absence of both dominant alleles. Wait, but in reality, any dominant allele makes the bird brown, regardless of the other allele. So the checkered phenotype is only when both alleles are recessive.\n\nThus, the ratio should be 7:2. Among 9 birds, 7 brown and 2 checkered.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none exactly say 7:2, but option D is checkered 1, brown 3, which doesn't fit. Option E is checkered 2, brown 6, which is closer but still not exact. Option G is checkered 12, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 genotypes. Let me re-examine the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, and when crossed, the F2 should have the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\nEach gene segregates into two possibilities. For C: CC, Cc, cc\n\nFor B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (prob 25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, the F2 population consists of 9 birds, each with a unique genotype as above.\n\nNow, applying the dominance hierarchy:\n\nIf any allele is dominant, the bird is brown; else, checkered.\n\nSo, checking each bird:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nCounting the phenotypes:\n\nBrown: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 birds\n\nCheckered: 3,6,7,8,9 \u2192 5 birds\n\nSo the ratio is 4:5 for Brown:Checkered.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none match this exactly, but option D says checkered 1, brown 3, which doesn't fit. Option E says checkered 2, brown 6, which is closer but still not exact. Option G is checkered 12, which is wrong. Option H: checkered 5, brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option J: checkered 2, brown 6 \u2192 Closest but still not exact. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option B: 6,2,2,2 \u2192 No. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 No. Option D: 1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nBird 1: Brown\nBird 2: Brown\nBird 3: Checkered\nBird 4: Brown\nBird 5: Brown\nBird 6: Checkered\nBird 7: Checkered\nBird 8: Checkered\nBird 9: Checkered\n\nTotal Brown: 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\nTotal Checkered: 3,6,7,8,9 \u2192 5\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:5 for Brown:Checkered.\n\nNone of the answer choices exactly reflect this, but option D is checkered 1, brown 3, which is lower than our calculated value. Option E is checkered 2, brown 6, which is higher than our calculated value (5 vs 6). Option H is checkered 5, brown 3, which is inverse of what we have.\n\nWait, perhaps the question intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of checkered versus brown, or vice versa. Option D states checkered 1, brown 3, which would imply a 1:3 ratio, but our calculations show 4:5. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest might be option E: checkered 2, brown 6, which sums to 8, leaving one bird unaccounted. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2, but the question specifies F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since that's unlikely, I might have made an error in calculating the phenotypic ratio. Let me try another approach: perhaps the checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, but that contradicts the earlier reasoning. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratio is supposed to be expressed differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that both genes are required to be dominant for the bird to be brown, and only one dominant allele results in brown, while the other gene can be anything. But that doesn't change the outcome as previously established.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the problem counts the number of each phenotype without accounting for the underlying genotype. For example, if a bird is heterozygous for one gene but homozygous for the other, it's considered brown. Let me recount:\n\nBird 1: CC BB \u2192 Brown\nBird 2: CC Bb \u2192 Brown\nBird 3: CC bb \u2192 Checkered\nBird 4: Cc BB \u2192 Brown\nBird 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nBird 6: Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\nBird 7: cc BB \u2192 Checkered\nBird 8: cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\nBird 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nStill 4 Brown, 5 Checkered.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and assume that both genes are needed for the phenotype, leading to the same ratio. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option D, even though it's slightly off, but I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

Alternatively, perhaps the F2 will have different genotypes based on the parents' genetic makeup.\n\nBut the main point is to determine the phenotypic ratio in F2. To do that, we need to consider the traits for each gene separately and then combine them. Let's look at each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- Dominant C = red\n- Recessive c = plain\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered\n\nSo, any individual with at least one dominant allele for either gene will exhibit the corresponding phenotype. Also, if both genes are present (i.e., both C/B are dominant), the phenotype depends on whether they are recessive (checkered) or dominant (brown).\n\nNow, let's compute the possible genotypes and phenotypes for F2:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so we can calculate the probabilities for each gene and then multiply them to get the overall probabilities for each combination.\n\nFirst, let's consider Gene C:\n\nParent 1: CC (so all gametes are C)\nParent 2: cc (all gametes are c)\n\nTherefore, F1 (from CC \u00d7 cc) will always be Cc, and F2 (from Cc \u00d7 Cc) will have 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n\nParent 1: BB (all gametes are B)\nParent 2: bb (all gametes are b)\n\nThus, F1 (from BB \u00d7 bb) will always be Bb, and F2 (from Bb \u00d7 Bb) will have 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nNow, let's list all possible combinations of the two genes in F2:\n\n1.

The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). The F1 has genotypes where each gene is in a 3:1 ratio (dominant : recessive). Therefore, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio across the two genes.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 25% CC (from F1 \u00d7 F1): This will have:\n   - 50% C_C_ (C_B_): Phenotype: brown-red checkered\n   - 50% C_cc (C_bb): Phenotype: plain red\n\n- 50% Cc (from F1): This will have:\n   - 25% CcB_ (C_B_): brown-red checkered\n   - 25% Ccbb (C_bb): plain red\n\n- 25% cc (from F1): This will have:\n   - 50% ccB_ (cc_B_): brown plain\n   - 50% ccbb (cc_bb): plain plain\n\nWait, but this seems off because the F2 isn't exactly a simple 9:3:3:1 ratio without considering dominance. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, each gene segregates independently, so the F2 for each gene will follow a 3:1 ratio. So for Gene C, 3/4 chance of dominant (C_), 1/4 recessive (cc). Similarly for Gene B, 3/4 chance of dominant (B_), 1/4 recessive (bb).\n\nThe combined probability for both genes being dominant (C_B_) is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nFor C dominant and B recessive (C_bb): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nFor c dominant and B dominant (cc_B_): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16.\n\nFor both recessive (cc_bb): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. C_B_: Brown-red checkered (as both genes are dominant)\n2. C_bb: Plain red (only pigment)\n3. cc_B_: Brown plain (only color)\n4. cc_bb: Plain plain (no pigment or color)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, broken down as follows:\n\n- Checkered brown: 9 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Brown plain: 3 parts\n- Plain plain: 1 part\n\nBut wait, none of the options match this exactly.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might combine into the same phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 will have different genotypes based on the parents' genetic makeup.\n\nBut the main point is to determine the phenotypic ratio in F2. To do that, we need to consider the traits for each gene separately and then combine them. Let's look at each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- Dominant C = red\n- Recessive c = plain\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered\n\nSo, any individual with at least one dominant allele for either gene will exhibit the corresponding phenotype.

Both C and B dominant (C_B_)\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C_bb)\n3. C recessive, B dominant (cc_B_)\n4. Both recessive (cc_bb)\n\nWait, but some of these may combine into the same phenotype.

The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). The F1 has genotypes where each gene is in a 3:1 ratio (dominant : recessive). Therefore, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio across the two genes.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 25% CC (from F1 \u00d7 F1): This will have:\n   - 50% C_C_ (C_B_): Phenotype: brown-red checkered\n   - 50% C_cc (C_bb): Phenotype: plain red\n\n- 50% Cc (from F1): This will have:\n   - 25% CcB_ (C_B_): brown-red checkered\n   - 25% Ccbb (C_bb): plain red\n\n- 25% cc (from F1): This will have:\n   - 50% ccB_ (cc_B_): brown plain\n   - 50% ccbb (cc_bb): plain plain\n\nWait, but this seems off because the F2 isn't exactly a simple 9:3:3:1 ratio without considering dominance. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, each gene segregates independently, so the F2 for each gene will follow a 3:1 ratio. So for Gene C, 3/4 chance of dominant (C_), 1/4 recessive (cc). Similarly for Gene B, 3/4 chance of dominant (B_), 1/4 recessive (bb).\n\nThe combined probability for both genes being dominant (C_B_) is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nFor C dominant and B recessive (C_bb): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nFor c dominant and B dominant (cc_B_): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16.\n\nFor both recessive (cc_bb): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. C_B_: Brown-red checkered (as both genes are dominant)\n2. C_bb: Plain red (only pigment)\n3. cc_B_: Brown plain (only color)\n4. cc_bb: Plain plain (no pigment or color)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, broken down as follows:\n\n- Checkered brown: 9 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Brown plain: 3 parts\n- Plain plain: 1 part\n\nBut wait, none of the options match this exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nSo option C matches our calculation of 9:3:3:1, with checkered brown having 9, plain red 3, brown plain 3, and plain plain 1. However, looking at the answer choices, option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014the checkered brown is already covered in the 9:3:3:1 ratio as the first category. So the actual counts are:\n\n- Checkered brown: 9\n- Plain red: 3\n- Brown plain: 3\n- Plain plain: 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but hold on\u2014the phenotypes in option C are checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). That aligns with our calculation.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C says: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, since each parent contributes either CB or cb, the actual F2 genotypes would be:",
    "rollout": " However, since each parent contributes either CB or cb, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom CB and CB: CC BB (25%)\n\nFrom CB and cb: Cc BB (but wait, no, because the other parent is cc bb, so the gametes would combine differently. Actually, each parent's gametes are CB and cb, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB (parent 1) and CB (parent 2): CC BB (25%)\n\n- From CB and cb: Cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, no, because the other parent is cc bb, so the gametes are cb. Therefore, the combinations would be:\n\n- CB (from parent 1) + cb (from parent 2) = Cc Bb (25%)\n\nSimilarly, cb (parent 1) + CB (parent 2) = Cc Bb (another 25%)\n\nAnd cb (parent 1) + cb (parent 2) = cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the F2 genotypes would be CC BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, and cc bb. Now, the phenotypes depend on the combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nEach bird is diploid, so each has two alleles. The phenotype depends on whether the bird is checking or plain (C vs. c) and whether it's brown or plain (B vs. b). But wait, the problem states that the dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. So for each gene:\n\n- C is dominant over c,\n- B is dominant over b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype for each gene is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it expresses that trait. So for example, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red. Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown. So the phenotype for each bird is determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes can be calculated based on the combinations of the alleles. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red (since C checks off for pigment, and B checks off for brown)\n\n2. Cc Bb: C is dominant, so it's Checkered. B is dominant, so brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n3. cc BB: c is recessive, so plain. B is dominant, so brown \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n4. cc bb: c is plain, b is recessive (so same as plain), and b is brown? Wait, no. Wait, the alleles for color and pigment are different. So in this case, the bird is plain (c) and has black (since b is for pigment, which is recessive). Wait, no, the problem says that 'red' is C, 'checkered' is c; 'brown' is B, 'plain' is b. So, for each gene:\n\n- For pigment (C and c): C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\n\n- For color (B and b): B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, a bird with at least one C (for pigment) and at least one B (for color) will express both traits, making it Checkered Red. A bird with at least one C and at least one b (checkered color) will be Checkered Brown. A bird with at least one c (plain) and at least one B (brown) will be Plain Brown. A bird with at least one c and at least one b (checkered) will be Plain Checkered.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the birds are of two colors (checkered and plain), and two pigmentation (red and brown). So, each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the phenotype is determined by any dominant allele present for each gene.\n\nGiven that, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (C and B)\n- Checkered Brown (C and b)\n- Plain Brown (c and B)\n- Plain Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of four types of birds, each with a specific genotype. Let's count how many of each genotype there are in the F2 population.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB: 25% of the population\n2. Cc Bb: 25%\n3. cc BB: 25%\n4. cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, let's map each genotype to its phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Cc Bb: C (dominant) \u2192 Checkered; B (dominant) \u2192 Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB: c (recessive) \u2192 Plain; B (dominant) \u2192 Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc bb: c (plain); b (recessive for pigment, but for color, it's the opposite? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem defines:\n\n- Red: C\n- Plain: c\n- Brown: B\n- Checkered: b\n\nSo, for color (the second gene):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nFor pigment (first gene):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Thus, the phenotype for a bird is determined by the combination of these traits. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C and B)\n2. Checkered Brown (C and b)\n3. Plain Brown (c and B)\n4. Plain Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 population:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% of the population \u2192 1/4\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Plain Checkered: 25% \u2192 1/4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching\n\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Hmm, that doesn't add up to 16\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 No, because total is 16\n\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 No\n\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No\n\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 This adds up to 16, but the option given is D: 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16, but D's sum is 1+3+9+3=16, but the numbers don't match our calculation.\n\nWait, my calculation shows each phenotype is 25%, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1. None of the options directly state that except perhaps option E, which is 3:9:1:3, which seems like a different distribution. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the phenotypes are determined independently for each gene, leading to four possible combinations. Each bird can exhibit any combination of the two traits. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, but each phenotype is represented three times, which doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of birds per phenotype, regardless of dominance. But according to the problem statement, dominance is defined as having at least one dominant allele for a gene. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B), it's Checkered Red. Otherwise, it's another phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% (1/4 of the population)\n- Checkered Brown: 25% (1/4)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (1/4)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (1/4)\n\nTotal 100%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but each phenotype is represented thrice, which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16, but the distribution is uneven.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which is less than 16, so probably incorrect.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:2 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the distribution isn't even.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match our expectation of 1:1:1:1. Maybe I misread the options.\n\nLet me look again at the options:\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 3:1:3:1\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 2:1:0:1\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Ratio 1:1:1:1\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18, invalid\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12, invalid\n\nWait, so none of the options exactly match 1:1:1:1, except for option F, which is 4:4:4:4. But according to our earlier analysis, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, not 25% for each, but rather 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option F is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" That adds up to 16, and each phenotype is 4, which is 1/4 of the population. So perhaps the question expects us to consider that each bird has four possible phenotypes, each occurring with equal frequency. In that case, option F would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me verify once more:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant, so Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: At least one dominant for both, so Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: c is recessive, so plain; B is dominant, so brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: c is plain; b is recessive (wait, no: the alleles for color are B and b. So if a bird has at least one B, it's brown; if at least one b, it's checkered. But in this case, the bird is cc, so both alleles are c, which is recessive for pigment but dominant for color. Wait, no: the problem defines:\n\n- Red: C\n- Plain: c\n- Brown: B\n- Checkered: b\n\nSo, for color (second gene), brown is dominant, checkered is recessive. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B, it's brown.\n- If it has at least one b, it's checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for pigment (first gene):\n\n- Red is dominant, plain is recessive.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nThus:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: Both recessive for pigment (since c is recessive), but B is dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n- cc bb: Both recessive for pigment (c) and both recessive for color (b) \u2192 Plain\n\nThus, each of these four categories (Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered) occurs with equal frequency (25%), so the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which also represents a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So perhaps option F is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that each bird has a certain number of alleles contributing to the phenotype, but in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact number.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio among the F2 generation, considering the number of each type of bird. Since the F2 generation is 25% each, but the options may represent the number of each phenotype multiplied by some factor.\n\nLooking back at the original F2 setup, the gametes were all CB and cb, giving four possible combinations:\n\n- CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n\n- CB x cb: Cc Bb (25%)\n\n- cb x CB: Cc Bb (25%)\n\n- cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nThus, each of the four genotypes appears once in the F2 generation, but their phenotypes are determined as above. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options do not include 1:1:1:1. Only option F does, which is 4:4:4:4. So perhaps the question expects the ratio expressed as 1:1:1:1 without simplifying, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the problem and the phenotypic ratio refers to the total number of each phenotype across the entire population, which would still be 4 each.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as numerical values, not percentages. So, for instance, option F is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which totals 16 birds, with each phenotype appearing 4 times. This matches our expectation of each phenotype being 25% of the population.\n\nTherefore, despite the confusion, option F is the most accurate representation of the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

So for each gene:\n\n- C is dominant over c,\n- B is dominant over b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype for each gene is determined by the presence of the dominant allele. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it expresses that trait. So for example, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red. Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown. So the phenotype for each bird is determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes can be calculated based on the combinations of the alleles. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red (since C checks off for pigment, and B checks off for brown)\n\n2. Cc Bb: C is dominant, so it's Checkered. B is dominant, so brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n3. cc BB: c is recessive, so plain. B is dominant, so brown \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n4. cc bb: c is plain, b is recessive (so same as plain), and b is brown? Wait, no. Wait, the alleles for color and pigment are different. So in this case, the bird is plain (c) and has black (since b is for pigment, which is recessive). Wait, no, the problem says that 'red' is C, 'checkered' is c; 'brown' is B, 'plain' is b. So, for each gene:\n\n- For pigment (C and c): C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\n\n- For color (B and b): B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, a bird with at least one C (for pigment) and at least one B (for color) will express both traits, making it Checkered Red. A bird with at least one C and at least one b (checkered color) will be Checkered Brown. A bird with at least one c (plain) and at least one B (brown) will be Plain Brown. A bird with at least one c and at least one b (checkered) will be Plain Checkered.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that the birds are of two colors (checkered and plain), and two pigmentation (red and brown). So, each bird has two alleles for each gene, and the phenotype is determined by any dominant allele present for each gene.\n\nGiven that, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (C and B)\n- Checkered Brown (C and b)\n- Plain Brown (c and B)\n- Plain Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of four types of birds, each with a specific genotype. Let's count how many of each genotype there are in the F2 population.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB: 25% of the population\n2. Cc Bb: 25%\n3. cc BB: 25%\n4. cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, let's map each genotype to its phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Cc Bb: C (dominant) \u2192 Checkered; B (dominant) \u2192 Brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB: c (recessive) \u2192 Plain; B (dominant) \u2192 Brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc bb: c (plain); b (recessive for pigment, but for color, it's the opposite? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem defines:\n\n- Red: C\n- Plain: c\n- Brown: B\n- Checkered: b\n\nSo, for color (the second gene):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nFor pigment (first gene):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Thus, the phenotype for a bird is determined by the combination of these traits. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C and B)\n2. Checkered Brown (C and b)\n3. Plain Brown (c and B)\n4. Plain Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 population:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% of the population \u2192 1/4\n- Checkered Brown: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Plain Checkered: 25% \u2192 1/4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Not matching\n\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Hmm, that doesn't add up to 16\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 No, because total is 16\n\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 No\n\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No\n\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 This adds up to 16, but the option given is D: 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16, but D's sum is 1+3+9+3=16, but the numbers don't match our calculation.\n\nWait, my calculation shows each phenotype is 25%, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1. None of the options directly state that except perhaps option E, which is 3:9:1:3, which seems like a different distribution. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the phenotypes are determined independently for each gene, leading to four possible combinations. Each bird can exhibit any combination of the two traits. So the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, but each phenotype is represented three times, which doesn't fit our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of birds per phenotype, regardless of dominance. But according to the problem statement, dominance is defined as having at least one dominant allele for a gene. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B), it's Checkered Red. Otherwise, it's another phenotype.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% (1/4 of the population)\n- Checkered Brown: 25% (1/4)\n- Plain Brown: 25% (1/4)\n- Plain Checkered: 25% (1/4)\n\nTotal 100%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but each phenotype is represented thrice, which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16, but the distribution is uneven.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum is 12, which is less than 16, so probably incorrect.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:2 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the distribution isn't even.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match our expectation of 1:1:1:1. Maybe I misread the options.\n\nLet me look again at the options:\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 3:1:3:1\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 2:1:0:1\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Ratio 1:1:1:1\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18, invalid\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16, ratio 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12, invalid\n\nWait, so none of the options exactly match 1:1:1:1, except for option F, which is 4:4:4:4. But according to our earlier analysis, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, not 25% for each, but rather 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option F is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\" That adds up to 16, and each phenotype is 4, which is 1/4 of the population. So perhaps the question expects us to consider that each bird has four possible phenotypes, each occurring with equal frequency. In that case, option F would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me verify once more:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant, so Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: At least one dominant for both, so Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: c is recessive, so plain; B is dominant, so brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: c is plain; b is recessive (wait, no: the alleles for color are B and b. So if a bird has at least one B, it's brown; if at least one b, it's checkered. But in this case, the bird is cc, so both alleles are c, which is recessive for pigment but dominant for color. Wait, no: the problem defines:\n\n- Red: C\n- Plain: c\n- Brown: B\n- Checkered: b\n\nSo, for color (second gene), brown is dominant, checkered is recessive. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B, it's brown.\n- If it has at least one b, it's checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for pigment (first gene):\n\n- Red is dominant, plain is recessive.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nThus:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Both dominant \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: Both recessive for pigment (since c is recessive), but B is dominant for color \u2192 Brown\n- cc bb: Both recessive for pigment (c) and both recessive for color (b) \u2192 Plain\n\nThus, each of these four categories (Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered) occurs with equal frequency (25%), so the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which also represents a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So perhaps option F is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that each bird has a certain number of alleles contributing to the phenotype, but in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact number.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio among the F2 generation, considering the number of each type of bird. Since the F2 generation is 25% each, but the options may represent the number of each phenotype multiplied by some factor.\n\nLooking back at the original F2 setup, the gametes were all CB and cb, giving four possible combinations:\n\n- CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n\n- CB x cb: Cc Bb (25%)\n\n- cb x CB: Cc Bb (25%)\n\n- cb x cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nThus, each of the four genotypes appears once in the F2 generation, but their phenotypes are determined as above. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options do not include 1:1:1:1. Only option F does, which is 4:4:4:4. So perhaps the question expects the ratio expressed as 1:1:1:1 without simplifying, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the problem and the phenotypic ratio refers to the total number of each phenotype across the entire population, which would still be 4 each.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as numerical values, not percentages. So, for instance, option F is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which totals 16 birds, with each phenotype appearing 4 times. This matches our expectation of each phenotype being 25% of the population.\n\nTherefore, despite the confusion, option F is the most accurate representation of the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering the genes are independently assorting, the F2 would be a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four traits.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering the genes are independently assorting, the F2 would be a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four traits. But in terms of phenotypes, some of these genotypes might lead to the same phenotype. Let's map the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment color: C (dominant, red) vs. c (recessive, plain)\n- Shape: B (dominant, brown) vs. b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo, each genotype leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nNow, let's list the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (Red Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC bb (Plain Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. cc BB (Checkered Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. cc bb (Plain Checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nBut wait, according to the user's options, the answer choices involve checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. However, in reality, the phenotypes depend on both coat color and pigmentation. So, for example, if a bird is CC BB (red), then regardless of the shape, it's red. Similarly, cc bb is plain checkered. CC bb is plain brown, and cc BB is checkered brown. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red\n- Plain Brown\n- Checkered Brown\n- Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the user's options given. Looking back at the problem statement, it says \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" And \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So the interaction is such that the presence of both B and c allows for different pigmentation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's genotype is a combination of two alleles for each gene. For pigment color (gene B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (plain)\n\nFor pigmentation (gene C):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both genes. For example, a bird with genotype BB (if both B and b were present, but actually, each gene is independent, so a bird could be BB for pigment and cc for pigmentation, resulting in a combination like Checkered Brown).\n\nWait, no\u2014the user said that checkered pattern is controlled by gene C, and plain color by c. So, the pattern (checkered or plain) is determined by gene C, while the color (brown or red) is determined by gene B. So the phenotype is a combination of both.\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (Bb for B and cc for C)\n2. Checkered Red (Cc for C and bb for B)\n3. Plain Brown (cc for C and Bb for B)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc for C and bb for B)\n\nSo now, mapping the F2 genotypes to these phenotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square analysis above, the F2 would include:\n\n- CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CC bb (Plain Brown)\n- cc BB (Checkered Brown)\n- cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n- Also, there's another possibility where a bird has Cc and Bb, leading to CcBb, which would mean Checkered Brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant), but wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc for pigmentation (B is dominant, so Cc would express B, making it brown), and cc for pigmentation (no, wait, Cc is for pigmentation, but in this case, the bird is CcBb, so the pigmentation trait is expressed as B, hence brown. The pigmentation is determined by B, so Bb would make it brown, whereas bb makes it plain. So the phenotype for CcBb would be Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, CcBB would also be Checkered Brown, as the pigment is dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps I've confused the notation earlier. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nEach bird's genotype is a combination of two alleles for each gene. So, for pigment color (B/Bb):\n\n- B: Brown\n- b: Plain\n\nAnd for pigmentation (C/Cc):\n\n- C: Red\n- c: Plain\n\nTherefore, the phenotype combines both traits. So, for a bird with genotype CcBb:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): B is dominant, so Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): C is dominant, so Red\n\nSo the phenotype would be Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, a bird with genotype CcBB:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): Red \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but in this case, since both genes are dominant, the phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n\nAnother bird with genotype CCbb:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): B is dominant, so Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): c is recessive, so Plain \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nA bird with genotype ccBB:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): c is recessive, so Plain \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nA bird with genotype ccbb:\n\n- Both genes are recessive \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAdditionally, a bird with genotype CcBb:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): Red \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but I think I've got this wrong. Because in reality, each gene is independently assorting, so each bird's genotype for pigment color (B/Bb) is independent of their genotype for pigmentation (C/Cc). So the combined phenotype is determined by both genes together.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. The phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, for pigment color (B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele, it expresses brown (dominant).\n- If it has no B alleles, it expresses plain.\n\nSimilarly, for pigmentation (C):\n\n- If it has at least one C allele, it expresses red.\n- If it has none, it expresses plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype can be:\n\n- Checkered Brown (both C and B are recessive)\n- Checkered Red (only C is recessive)\n- Plain Brown (only B is recessive)\n- Plain Checkered (both B and C are recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of one dominant allele per gene results in the respective expression. So, for pigment color (B), if the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown. If not, it's plain. For pigmentation (C), if at least one C allele, it's red. Otherwise, plain.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB)\n2. Checkered Red (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (BB cc)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc cc)\n\nWait, but no\u2014the phenotype isn't just based on individual genes but the combination. For example, if a bird has Cc for pigmentation and Bb for color, it would still be Checkered Brown. So, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes.\n\nLet me create a table to map all possible F2 genotypes to their phenotypes:\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (both genes dominant)\n2. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n3. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (both genes recessive)\n5. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n6. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n9. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n10. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n11. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n12. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n13. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n14. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The F2 generation includes all possible combinations of the four parents' gametes. Since Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes, the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will come from F1 selfing. So, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate because each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (both genes dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- cc: Plain Checkered (both genes recessive)\n\nBut wait, Cc in pigmentation refers to the B gene, and cc refers to the C gene. So, in terms of phenotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red\n- Cc: Checkered Brown\n- cc: Plain Checkered\n\nBut looking back, the F2 genotypes also affect the pigment color. For example, Cc (pigment recessive) would mean the bird is plain, but depending on the C gene, it would be Checkered Red or Plain Checkered. Wait, no\u2014the C and B genes are independent, so the phenotype is determined by the combination of both.\n\nWait, no\u2014the C and B genes determine pigmentation and pattern respectively. So, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has any dominant alleles for each gene. For example:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (pigment dominant), it's brown.\n- If the bird has at least one C allele (pigmentation dominant), it's red.\n- If neither, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (Bb for B, cc for C)\n2. Checkered Red (bb for B, Cc for C)\n3. Plain Brown (Bb for B, CC for C)\n4. Plain Checkered (bb for B, cc for C)\n\nWait, but in the F2 generation, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (both dominant)\n- CC bb: Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n- cc BB: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- cc bb: Plain Checkered (both recessive)\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations:\n\n- Cc BB: Checkered Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n- Cc bb: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n- CC bb: Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n- cc BB: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- cc Bb: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n- cc bb: Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this seems too broad. Maybe I should approach it differently by calculating the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nSince the F2 generation consists of 16 possible combinations (assuming each parent contributes half their gametes), but given that each parent is heterozygous for both genes, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. However, since the phenotypes are dependent on both genes, the actual counts may differ.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (Bb for B, cc for C)\n2. Checkered Red (bb for B, Cc for C)\n3. Plain Brown (Bb for B, CC for C)\n4. Plain Checkered (bb for B, cc for C)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nProbability of Checkered Brown (phenotype 1):\n\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one B allele (brown) and at least one c allele (checkered). Since B and C are independent, the probability is:\n\n(Probability of B) * (Probability of c) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nBut wait, in reality, the bird must have at least one B and at least one c. Since B and C are both expressed, the probability is indeed 1/4.\n\nProbability of Checkered Red (phenotype 2):\n\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one b allele (no B, so plain) and at least one c allele (checkered).

Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nProbability of Plain Checkered (phenotype 4):\n\nThis occurs when both B and C are recessive. Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that adds up to 1 (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1), which suggests all phenotypes are equally likely. But that doesn't seem right because the presence of one dominant allele affects the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014it does, because the presence of either dominant allele changes the phenotype.\n\nWait, no, I think my mistake is that in reality, the presence of a dominant allele for pigment color (B) affects the pigment color, and similarly for pigmentation (C). Therefore, the phenotypes are not simply determined by the presence of one dominant allele but by the combination of both. Thus, the four phenotypes are distinct based on the combination of B and C alleles.\n\nIn that case, each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of alleles:\n\n- Checkered Brown (Bb for B, cc for C)\n- Checkered Red (bb for B, Cc for C)\n- Plain Brown (Bb for B, CC for C)\n- Plain Checkered (bb for B, cc for C)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype would be calculated based on the independent assortment of B and C alleles.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is 1/4, but let me verify this.\n\nTo calculate the exact probabilities, we can use the Punnett square approach.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes from each parent are CB and cb.\n\nF2 genotypes are formed by combining these:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (both B and C are dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- cc: Plain Checkered (both B and C are recessive)\n\nBut wait, each genotype's phenotype depends on the combination of B and C alleles.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering the genes are independently assorting, the F2 would be a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four traits. But in terms of phenotypes, some of these genotypes might lead to the same phenotype. Let's map the phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment color: C (dominant, red) vs. c (recessive, plain)\n- Shape: B (dominant, brown) vs. b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo, each genotype leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nNow, let's list the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (Red Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC bb (Plain Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n3. cc BB (Checkered Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. cc bb (Plain Checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nBut wait, according to the user's options, the answer choices involve checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. However, in reality, the phenotypes depend on both coat color and pigmentation. So, for example, if a bird is CC BB (red), then regardless of the shape, it's red. Similarly, cc bb is plain checkered. CC bb is plain brown, and cc BB is checkered brown. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red\n- Plain Brown\n- Checkered Brown\n- Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the user's options given. Looking back at the problem statement, it says \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" And \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So the interaction is such that the presence of both B and c allows for different pigmentation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's genotype is a combination of two alleles for each gene. For pigment color (gene B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (plain)\n\nFor pigmentation (gene C):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both genes. For example, a bird with genotype BB (if both B and b were present, but actually, each gene is independent, so a bird could be BB for pigment and cc for pigmentation, resulting in a combination like Checkered Brown).\n\nWait, no\u2014the user said that checkered pattern is controlled by gene C, and plain color by c. So, the pattern (checkered or plain) is determined by gene C, while the color (brown or red) is determined by gene B. So the phenotype is a combination of both.\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (Bb for B and cc for C)\n2. Checkered Red (Cc for C and bb for B)\n3. Plain Brown (cc for C and Bb for B)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc for C and bb for B)\n\nSo now, mapping the F2 genotypes to these phenotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square analysis above, the F2 would include:\n\n- CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CC bb (Plain Brown)\n- cc BB (Checkered Brown)\n- cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n- Also, there's another possibility where a bird has Cc and Bb, leading to CcBb, which would mean Checkered Brown (since C is dominant and B is dominant), but wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc for pigmentation (B is dominant, so Cc would express B, making it brown), and cc for pigmentation (no, wait, Cc is for pigmentation, but in this case, the bird is CcBb, so the pigmentation trait is expressed as B, hence brown. The pigmentation is determined by B, so Bb would make it brown, whereas bb makes it plain. So the phenotype for CcBb would be Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, CcBB would also be Checkered Brown, as the pigment is dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps I've confused the notation earlier. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nEach bird's genotype is a combination of two alleles for each gene. So, for pigment color (B/Bb):\n\n- B: Brown\n- b: Plain\n\nAnd for pigmentation (C/Cc):\n\n- C: Red\n- c: Plain\n\nTherefore, the phenotype combines both traits. So, for a bird with genotype CcBb:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): B is dominant, so Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): C is dominant, so Red\n\nSo the phenotype would be Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, a bird with genotype CcBB:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): Red \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but in this case, since both genes are dominant, the phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n\nAnother bird with genotype CCbb:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): B is dominant, so Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): c is recessive, so Plain \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nA bird with genotype ccBB:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): c is recessive, so Plain \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nA bird with genotype ccbb:\n\n- Both genes are recessive \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAdditionally, a bird with genotype CcBb:\n\n- Pigmentation (B): Brown\n- Pigmentation (C): Red \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\nWait, but I think I've got this wrong. Because in reality, each gene is independently assorting, so each bird's genotype for pigment color (B/Bb) is independent of their genotype for pigmentation (C/Cc). So the combined phenotype is determined by both genes together.\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. The phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, for pigment color (B):\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele, it expresses brown (dominant).\n- If it has no B alleles, it expresses plain.\n\nSimilarly, for pigmentation (C):\n\n- If it has at least one C allele, it expresses red.\n- If it has none, it expresses plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype can be:\n\n- Checkered Brown (both C and B are recessive)\n- Checkered Red (only C is recessive)\n- Plain Brown (only B is recessive)\n- Plain Checkered (both B and C are recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of one dominant allele per gene results in the respective expression. So, for pigment color (B), if the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown. If not, it's plain. For pigmentation (C), if at least one C allele, it's red. Otherwise, plain.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB)\n2. Checkered Red (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (BB cc)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc cc)\n\nWait, but no\u2014the phenotype isn't just based on individual genes but the combination. For example, if a bird has Cc for pigmentation and Bb for color, it would still be Checkered Brown. So, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes.\n\nLet me create a table to map all possible F2 genotypes to their phenotypes:\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (both genes dominant)\n2. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n3. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (both genes recessive)\n5. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n6. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n9. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n10. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n11. cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n12. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n13. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n14. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The F2 generation includes all possible combinations of the four parents' gametes. Since Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes, the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will come from F1 selfing. So, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate because each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (both genes dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- cc: Plain Checkered (both genes recessive)\n\nBut wait, Cc in pigmentation refers to the B gene, and cc refers to the C gene. So, in terms of phenotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red\n- Cc: Checkered Brown\n- cc: Plain Checkered\n\nBut looking back, the F2 genotypes also affect the pigment color. For example, Cc (pigment recessive) would mean the bird is plain, but depending on the C gene, it would be Checkered Red or Plain Checkered. Wait, no\u2014the C and B genes are independent, so the phenotype is determined by the combination of both.\n\nWait, no\u2014the C and B genes determine pigmentation and pattern respectively. So, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has any dominant alleles for each gene. For example:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (pigment dominant), it's brown.\n- If the bird has at least one C allele (pigmentation dominant), it's red.\n- If neither, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (Bb for B, cc for C)\n2. Checkered Red (bb for B, Cc for C)\n3. Plain Brown (Bb for B, CC for C)\n4. Plain Checkered (bb for B, cc for C)\n\nWait, but in the F2 generation, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (both dominant)\n- CC bb: Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n- cc BB: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- cc bb: Plain Checkered (both recessive)\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations:\n\n- Cc BB: Checkered Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n- Cc bb: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n- CC bb: Plain Brown (pigment dominant, pigmentation recessive)\n- cc BB: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- cc Bb: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation recessive)\n- cc bb: Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this seems too broad. Maybe I should approach it differently by calculating the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nSince the F2 generation consists of 16 possible combinations (assuming each parent contributes half their gametes), but given that each parent is heterozygous for both genes, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. However, since the phenotypes are dependent on both genes, the actual counts may differ.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (Bb for B, cc for C)\n2. Checkered Red (bb for B, Cc for C)\n3. Plain Brown (Bb for B, CC for C)\n4. Plain Checkered (bb for B, cc for C)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nProbability of Checkered Brown (phenotype 1):\n\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one B allele (brown) and at least one c allele (checkered). Since B and C are independent, the probability is:\n\n(Probability of B) * (Probability of c) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nBut wait, in reality, the bird must have at least one B and at least one c. Since B and C are both expressed, the probability is indeed 1/4.\n\nProbability of Checkered Red (phenotype 2):\n\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one b allele (no B, so plain) and at least one c allele (checkered). So:\n\n(Probability of b) * (Probability of c) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nProbability of Plain Brown (phenotype 3):\n\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one b allele (no B) and no c alleles (so both C and B are recessive). Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nProbability of Plain Checkered (phenotype 4):\n\nThis occurs when both B and C are recessive. Probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that adds up to 1 (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1), which suggests all phenotypes are equally likely. But that doesn't seem right because the presence of one dominant allele affects the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014it does, because the presence of either dominant allele changes the phenotype.\n\nWait, no, I think my mistake is that in reality, the presence of a dominant allele for pigment color (B) affects the pigment color, and similarly for pigmentation (C). Therefore, the phenotypes are not simply determined by the presence of one dominant allele but by the combination of both. Thus, the four phenotypes are distinct based on the combination of B and C alleles.\n\nIn that case, each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of alleles:\n\n- Checkered Brown (Bb for B, cc for C)\n- Checkered Red (bb for B, Cc for C)\n- Plain Brown (Bb for B, CC for C)\n- Plain Checkered (bb for B, cc for C)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype would be calculated based on the independent assortment of B and C alleles.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is 1/4, but let me verify this.\n\nTo calculate the exact probabilities, we can use the Punnett square approach.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes from each parent are CB and cb.\n\nF2 genotypes are formed by combining these:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (both B and C are dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered Brown (pigment recessive, pigmentation dominant)\n- cc: Plain Checkered (both B and C are recessive)\n\nBut wait, each genotype's phenotype depends on the combination of B and C alleles. So, let's list them:\n\n- CC: B is dominant, C is dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc: B is recessive (because bb?), wait no\u2014wait, no. In our case, each bird has two copies of each gene. So, the genotype for pigment color (B) is determined by the alleles, and similarly for pigmentation (C).\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment color (B):\n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 Plain\n- For pigmentation (C):\n  - Dominant (C) \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore:\n\n- CC (B is dominant, C is dominant) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc (B is recessive, but C is dominant) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc (B is recessive, C is recessive) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but that's only three phenotypes. There must be a fourth phenotype. Oh, wait\u2014I forgot that B and C are independent. The presence of any dominant allele in either gene leads to the respective expression.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of any dominant allele for pigment color (B) leads to brown, and any dominant allele for pigmentation (C) leads to red. So, a bird that has at least one dominant allele for each gene will be Checkered Brown. A bird that has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (B) but no dominant allele for pigmentation (C) will be Checkered Brown. Conversely, a bird that has no dominant allele for pigment color (B) but has a dominant allele for pigmentation (C) will be Plain Brown. A bird with no dominant alleles for either will be Plain Checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (B), it will be brown. If it also has at least one dominant allele for pigmentation (C), it will be red. If it has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (B) but none for pigmentation (C), it'll be brown. Similarly, if it has none for B but at least one for C, it'll be plain brown. Only if it has none for either, it'll be plain checkered.\n\nWait, that's getting confusing.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, in reality, the F1 is CcBb, so during gamete formation, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb.",
    "rollout": " However, in reality, the F1 is CcBb, so during gamete formation, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. Therefore, the F2 will have a 25% chance of each combination, leading to four genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). But now, considering dominance, the actual phenotypes depend on the alleles present.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios. Let's focus on the F2 phenotypes. The F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant): Checkered red\n2. CC Bb (heterozygous): Checkered brown\n3. CC bb (homozygous recessive): Plain brown\n4. Cc BB (heterozygous): Pigmented red (since C is dominant over c)\n5. Cc Bb (heterozygous): Pigmented brown (since B is dominant over b)\n6. Cc bb (homozygous recessive): Plain brown\n7. cc BB (homozygous recessive): Plain red\n8. cc Bb (heterozygous): Plain brown\n9. cc bb (homozygous recessive): Plain red\n\nBut wait, some of these may overlap. Specifically, Cc BB would have phenotype \"pigmented red,\" while CC BB is \"checkered red.\" Similarly, Cc Bb would be \"pigmented brown,\" and cc BB is \"plain red.\"\n\nNow, the actual number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype in F2. In F2, each of the four genotypes (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, etc.) occurs at a certain frequency. Since each parent contributes gametes in a 50% CB and 50% cb ratio, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, but that's nine possible genotypes, each with a frequency of 1/9 if considering independent assortment. However, since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb, which undergoes selfing. So the F2 genotypes would include CC (25%), CC (another 25%), but wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Let me recast the F2 genotypes correctly. From F1 (CcBb):\n\n- F1 gametes: 50% CB, 50% cb\n- F2 genotypes: (CB + CB) = CC (25%), (CB + cb) = Cc (50%), (cb + cb) = cc (25%)\n\nSo, in F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nEach of these corresponds to different phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigmented red (since C is dominant over c)\n- cc: Plain red (since c is recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Pigmented brown\n- bb: Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two loci. So, each F2 individual's phenotype is determined by their genotype in terms of both C and B.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 individuals:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype: R)\n2. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red (R)\nWait, no\u2014it's a 50% chance for each. Actually, the F2 population is composed of:\n\n- 25% CC BB: Checkered red\n- 25% CC Bb: Pigmented red\n- 25% CC bb: Plain red\n- 25% Cc BB: Pigmented red\n- 25% Cc Bb: Pigmented brown\n- 25% Cc bb: Plain brown\n- 25% cc BB: Plain red\n- 25% cc Bb: Plain brown\n- 25% cc bb: Plain red\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me clarify. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBut considering dominance, some genotypes combine into phenotypes without distinction:\n\n- CC (any B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC (any b) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC (any bb) \u2192 Checkered red (but that's same as CC BB, BB, etc.)\n- Cc (any B) \u2192 Pigmented red\n- Cc (any b) \u2192 Pigmented brown\n- cc (any B) \u2192 Plain red\n- cc (any b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The presence of dominant alleles leads to specific phenotypes. So, for example, CC BB would be Checkered red, CC Bb would be Pigmented red, CC bb would be Plain red. Similarly, Cc BB would be Pigmented red, Cc Bb would be Pigmented brown, Cc bb would be Plain brown. And cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb would all be Plain red and Plain brown respectively.\n\nNow, calculating the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (from CC):\n  - CC BB: 25%\n  - CC Bb: 25%\n  - CC bb: 25%\n  Total: 75% (since all three are Checkered red)\n  \n- Pigmented red (from Cc):\n  - Cc BB: 25%\n  - Cc Bb: 25%\n  Total: 50%\n\n- Plain red (from cc):\n  - cc BB: 25%\n  - cc Bb: 25%\n  Total: 50%\n\nWait, that adds up to 75% + 50% + 50% = 175%, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake here. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach of the F2 genotypes has a 25% chance. Now, considering dominance:\n\n- For the C locus (gene C):\n  - Dominant C (C_): Checkered\n  - Recessive c (cc): Plain\n\n- For the B locus (gene B):\n  - Dominant B (B_): Brown\n  - Recessive b (bb): Plain\n\nThus, the phenotype combines both loci:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant, phenotype is Checkered red.\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive, phenotype is Checkered brown.\n- If neither C nor B is dominant, phenotype is Plain red.\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant, phenotype is Pigmented brown.\n- If both C and B are recessive, phenotype is Plain brown.\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_ and B_):**\n   - This includes all genotypes where C is dominant and B is dominant.\n   - Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n   - Frequency: 5 genotypes * 25% each = 125%? Wait, no\u2014each individual has a 25% chance, but the total population is 100%. So:\n     - Checkered red: 5/9 \u2248 55.56%\n     - Checkered brown: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n   \n2. **Pigmented red (C_ and bb):**\n   - Includes genotypes where C is dominant and B is recessive.\n   - Genotypes: CC bb, Cc bb\n   - Frequency: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n   \n3. **Plain red (cc and B_: but wait, if c is recessive, regardless of B, it's plain red.)\n   - Genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb\n   - Frequency: 3/9 = 33.33%\n   \n4. **Pigmented brown (cc and bb):**\n   - Includes genotypes where c is recessive and B is dominant.\n   - Genotypes: cc Bb\n   - Frequency: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nWait, let's sum these up:\n\n- Checkered red: ~55.56%\n- Pigmented red: ~22.22%\n- Plain red: ~33.33%\n- Pigmented brown: ~11.11%\n\nAdding them: 55.56 + 22.22 + 33.33 + 11.11 \u2248 122.22%, which exceeds 100%. That indicates a miscalculation. Let's re-express:\n\nActually, the probabilities are additive, so:\n\n- Checkered red: 5/9 \u2248 55.56%\n- Pigmented red: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain red: 3/9 = 33.33%\n- Pigmented brown: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nTotal: 55.56 + 22.22 + 33.33 + 11.11 = 122.22%, which is still incorrect. I think the error arises from miscounting the number of favorable outcomes. Let's consider the actual number of favorable genotypes:\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_ and B_):** All genotypes except CC bb, Cc bb, and cc B_. So that's 6 out of 9.\n   - Frequency: 6/9 = 66.66%\n   \n2. **Pigmented red (C_ and bb):** Genotypes CC bb, Cc bb. So 2 out of 9.\n   - Frequency: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n   \n3. **Plain red (cc and B_):** Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. So 3 out of 9.\n   - Frequency: 3/9 = 33.33%\n   \n4. **Pigmented brown (cc and bb):** Only cc Bb. So 1 out of 9.\n   - Frequency: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nNow, adding these up: 66.66 + 22.22 + 33.33 + 11.11 = 133.33%, which is still wrong. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in counting. Let's simplify:\n\nThe correct way is to recognize that:\n\n- Checkered red: any C and any B (so C_ and B_), which is 6/9\n- Pigmented red: C_ and bb, which is 2/9\n- Plain red: cc and anything (since B can vary), which is 3/9\n- Pigmented brown: cc and B_, which is 1/9\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 6:2:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Pigmented red : Plain red : Pigmented brown.\n\nIn terms of counts, if there are N individuals in F2, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 6N/9 = 2N/3\n- Pigmented red: 2N/9\n- Plain red: 3N/9 = N/3\n- Pigmented brown: N/9\n\nIf we assume a large enough N, the ratios become approximately 6:2:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOptions A to J don't seem to match this directly. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum: 16, which is less than total.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nF.

Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum: 12.\n\nWait, none of the options directly reflect the 6:2:3:1 ratio. However, looking at option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum: 16. Hmm, that's 12+2+2=16. Doesn't fit our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider only the counts based on independent assortment, leading to 25% for each genotype, resulting in phenotypic ratios of 1:1:1:1. That would correspond to option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Wait, that sums to 5+3+2+6=16. But that's not a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the initial setup. Maybe the parents are not CC BB and cc bb but something else. Let me double-check the initial setup:\n\nParents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is based on selfing F1. So the F2 genotypes are as previously calculated, leading to the 6:2:3:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none exactly match this. Option D says Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum: 16. Wait, that would imply 9 plain red, which might come from 25% of the F2 (if each genotype is 25%), but that's inconsistent with dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype regardless of the number of individuals, treating each gamete equally. But that wouldn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simplified to count the number of each genotype, not the number of individuals, leading to the phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. That would mean option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Wait, that's not consistent with 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation, and the options are presented with counts rather than percentages. So, if we take the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25% Checkered red\n- CC Bb: 25% Checkered red\n- CC bb: 25% Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: 25% Pigmented red\n- Cc Bb: 25% Pigmented brown\n- Cc bb: 25% Plain brown\n- cc BB: 25% Plain red\n- cc Bb: 25% Plain brown\n- cc bb: 25% Plain red\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypic counts assuming 100 individuals:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% \u2192 50 individuals\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Pigmented red: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Pigmented brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n\nThis totals 125%, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to note that:\n\n- Checkered red: all genotypes where C is dominant and B is dominant: 6 out of 9\n- Pigmented red: C dominant and B recessive: 2 out of 9\n- Plain red: cc and B recessive: 3 out of 9\n- Pigmented brown: cc and B dominant: 1 out of 9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding these: 1+3+9+3=16. If each individual is contributing equally, but the phenotypic ratio isn't matching the 6:2:3:1.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding to 16. Again, not matching.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum 16. Doesn't match.\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum 16. Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user intended to use the 1:1:1:1 ratio instead of considering dominance,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, in reality, the F1 is CcBb, so during gamete formation, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. Therefore, the F2 will have a 25% chance of each combination, leading to four genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). But now, considering dominance, the actual phenotypes depend on the alleles present.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios. Let's focus on the F2 phenotypes. The F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (homozygous dominant): Checkered red\n2. CC Bb (heterozygous): Checkered brown\n3. CC bb (homozygous recessive): Plain brown\n4. Cc BB (heterozygous): Pigmented red (since C is dominant over c)\n5. Cc Bb (heterozygous): Pigmented brown (since B is dominant over b)\n6. Cc bb (homozygous recessive): Plain brown\n7. cc BB (homozygous recessive): Plain red\n8. cc Bb (heterozygous): Plain brown\n9. cc bb (homozygous recessive): Plain red\n\nBut wait, some of these may overlap. Specifically, Cc BB would have phenotype \"pigmented red,\" while CC BB is \"checkered red.\" Similarly, Cc Bb would be \"pigmented brown,\" and cc BB is \"plain red.\"\n\nNow, the actual number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype in F2. In F2, each of the four genotypes (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, etc.) occurs at a certain frequency. Since each parent contributes gametes in a 50% CB and 50% cb ratio, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, but that's nine possible genotypes, each with a frequency of 1/9 if considering independent assortment. However, since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 is CcBb, which undergoes selfing. So the F2 genotypes would include CC (25%), CC (another 25%), but wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Let me recast the F2 genotypes correctly. From F1 (CcBb):\n\n- F1 gametes: 50% CB, 50% cb\n- F2 genotypes: (CB + CB) = CC (25%), (CB + cb) = Cc (50%), (cb + cb) = cc (25%)\n\nSo, in F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nEach of these corresponds to different phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Pigmented red (since C is dominant over c)\n- cc: Plain red (since c is recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Pigmented brown\n- bb: Plain brown\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two loci. So, each F2 individual's phenotype is determined by their genotype in terms of both C and B.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 individuals:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red (phenotype: R)\n2. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red (R)\nWait, no\u2014it's a 50% chance for each.

And cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb would all be Plain red and Plain brown respectively.\n\nNow, calculating the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (from CC):\n  - CC BB: 25%\n  - CC Bb: 25%\n  - CC bb: 25%\n  Total: 75% (since all three are Checkered red)\n  \n- Pigmented red (from Cc):\n  - Cc BB: 25%\n  - Cc Bb: 25%\n  Total: 50%\n\n- Plain red (from cc):\n  - cc BB: 25%\n  - cc Bb: 25%\n  Total: 50%\n\nWait, that adds up to 75% + 50% + 50% = 175%, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake here. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach of the F2 genotypes has a 25% chance. Now, considering dominance:\n\n- For the C locus (gene C):\n  - Dominant C (C_): Checkered\n  - Recessive c (cc): Plain\n\n- For the B locus (gene B):\n  - Dominant B (B_): Brown\n  - Recessive b (bb): Plain\n\nThus, the phenotype combines both loci:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant, phenotype is Checkered red.\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive, phenotype is Checkered brown.\n- If neither C nor B is dominant, phenotype is Plain red.\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant, phenotype is Pigmented brown.\n- If both C and B are recessive, phenotype is Plain brown.\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_ and B_):**\n   - This includes all genotypes where C is dominant and B is dominant.\n   - Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n   - Frequency: 5 genotypes * 25% each = 125%? Wait, no\u2014each individual has a 25% chance, but the total population is 100%. So:\n     - Checkered red: 5/9 \u2248 55.56%\n     - Checkered brown: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n   \n2. **Pigmented red (C_ and bb):**\n   - Includes genotypes where C is dominant and B is recessive.\n   - Genotypes: CC bb, Cc bb\n   - Frequency: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n   \n3. **Plain red (cc and B_: but wait, if c is recessive, regardless of B, it's plain red.)\n   - Genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb\n   - Frequency: 3/9 = 33.33%\n   \n4. **Pigmented brown (cc and bb):**\n   - Includes genotypes where c is recessive and B is dominant.\n   - Genotypes: cc Bb\n   - Frequency: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nWait, let's sum these up:\n\n- Checkered red: ~55.56%\n- Pigmented red: ~22.22%\n- Plain red: ~33.33%\n- Pigmented brown: ~11.11%\n\nAdding them: 55.56 + 22.22 + 33.33 + 11.11 \u2248 122.22%, which exceeds 100%. That indicates a miscalculation. Let's re-express:\n\nActually, the probabilities are additive, so:\n\n- Checkered red: 5/9 \u2248 55.56%\n- Pigmented red: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain red: 3/9 = 33.33%\n- Pigmented brown: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nTotal: 55.56 + 22.22 + 33.33 + 11.11 = 122.22%, which is still incorrect. I think the error arises from miscounting the number of favorable outcomes. Let's consider the actual number of favorable genotypes:\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_ and B_):** All genotypes except CC bb, Cc bb, and cc B_. So that's 6 out of 9.\n   - Frequency: 6/9 = 66.66%\n   \n2. **Pigmented red (C_ and bb):** Genotypes CC bb, Cc bb. So 2 out of 9.\n   - Frequency: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n   \n3. **Plain red (cc and B_):** Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. So 3 out of 9.\n   - Frequency: 3/9 = 33.33%\n   \n4. **Pigmented brown (cc and bb):** Only cc Bb. So 1 out of 9.\n   - Frequency: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nNow, adding these up: 66.66 + 22.22 + 33.33 + 11.11 = 133.33%, which is still wrong. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in counting. Let's simplify:\n\nThe correct way is to recognize that:\n\n- Checkered red: any C and any B (so C_ and B_), which is 6/9\n- Pigmented red: C_ and bb, which is 2/9\n- Plain red: cc and anything (since B can vary), which is 3/9\n- Pigmented brown: cc and B_, which is 1/9\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 6:2:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Pigmented red : Plain red : Pigmented brown.\n\nIn terms of counts, if there are N individuals in F2, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 6N/9 = 2N/3\n- Pigmented red: 2N/9\n- Plain red: 3N/9 = N/3\n- Pigmented brown: N/9\n\nIf we assume a large enough N, the ratios become approximately 6:2:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOptions A to J don't seem to match this directly. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum: 16, which is less than total.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum: 16.\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum: 12.\n\nWait, none of the options directly reflect the 6:2:3:1 ratio. However, looking at option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum: 16. Hmm, that's 12+2+2=16. Doesn't fit our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider only the counts based on independent assortment, leading to 25% for each genotype, resulting in phenotypic ratios of 1:1:1:1. That would correspond to option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Wait, that sums to 5+3+2+6=16. But that's not a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the initial setup. Maybe the parents are not CC BB and cc bb but something else. Let me double-check the initial setup:\n\nParents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Their F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is based on selfing F1. So the F2 genotypes are as previously calculated, leading to the 6:2:3:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none exactly match this. Option D says Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum: 16. Wait, that would imply 9 plain red, which might come from 25% of the F2 (if each genotype is 25%), but that's inconsistent with dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype regardless of the number of individuals, treating each gamete equally. But that wouldn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simplified to count the number of each genotype, not the number of individuals, leading to the phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. That would mean option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Wait, that's not consistent with 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation, and the options are presented with counts rather than percentages. So, if we take the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25% Checkered red\n- CC Bb: 25% Checkered red\n- CC bb: 25% Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: 25% Pigmented red\n- Cc Bb: 25% Pigmented brown\n- Cc bb: 25% Plain brown\n- cc BB: 25% Plain red\n- cc Bb: 25% Plain brown\n- cc bb: 25% Plain red\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypic counts assuming 100 individuals:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% \u2192 50 individuals\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Pigmented red: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Plain brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Pigmented brown: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n\nThis totals 125%, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to note that:\n\n- Checkered red: all genotypes where C is dominant and B is dominant: 6 out of 9\n- Pigmented red: C dominant and B recessive: 2 out of 9\n- Plain red: cc and B recessive: 3 out of 9\n- Pigmented brown: cc and B dominant: 1 out of 9\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D states Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding these: 1+3+9+3=16. If each individual is contributing equally, but the phenotypic ratio isn't matching the 6:2:3:1.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding to 16. Again, not matching.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum 16. Doesn't match.\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Sum 16. Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum 16. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user intended to use the 1:1:1:1 ratio instead of considering dominance,",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering that each parent contributes either CB or cb, the actual F2 genotypes would be:",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering that each parent contributes either CB or cb, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB gamete: CC (25%)\n- From CB gamete + cb gamete: Cc (25%)\n- From cb gamete + CB gamete: Cc (another 25%)\n- From cb gamete + cb gamete: cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Now, regarding the phenotype determination: Checkered (c) is recessive, so any bird with at least one c allele will be plain checkered. Pigmentation depends on B (dominant brown) and b (recessive checkered). So, if an individual has at least one B allele, they will be brown checkered (since c is present, being plain checkered). If they have B (at least one B) and at least one c, they'll be plain checkered. If they have bb (no B) and at least one c, they'll be brown (since B is recessive). Wait, correction: Phenotype is determined by the presence of B and b. If an animal has at least one B allele (B_), it will be brown, regardless of the c alleles. If it has no B alleles (bb), then it will be checkered (since c is dominant).\n\nWait, no, correction again: The dominance hierarchy is B > b, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown, and those with only b alleles are checkered. So the phenotypes are determined by whether the animal has at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (if at least one B allele): This includes:\n  - Checkered (if also c is present, i.e., cc)\n  - Plain brown (if also b is present, i.e., bb)\n\n- Checkered (if only c is present, i.e., cc)\n\nWait, but wait: If an animal has at least one B, it's brown, else checkered. So the presence of B doesn't matter if there's a b allele\u2014it's still brown. Only when there's no B and no b (i.e., bb) does it become checkered. Because B is dominant over b. So:\n\nPhenotype = Brown if at least one B allele.\n= Checkered if at least one c allele (since c is dominant over b).\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - Has two C alleles, no c, no b. So checkered. Brown.\n\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - One C, one c. At least one B (assuming B is present?), wait, no, C is dominant over c, so all Cc individuals have at least one dominant allele, so they're brown. Also, they don't have any b alleles, so they're all brown. But wait, the B and b alleles determine if they're brown or checkered. In Cc, they have at least one C, which is dominant, so they are brown. They may have some c, but that doesn't affect the B status. So Cc individuals are brown. Additionally, they might have some b alleles, but that doesn't change the fact that they have at least one C, making them brown.\n\n3. cc (25%):\n   - Two c alleles. So they have no B, and no b (since c is dominant over b, having two c's means they have no b's). Thus, they are checkered.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. An individual must have at least one dominant allele to express the trait. So, in terms of B and b:\n\n- If an individual has at least one B allele (B_), they are brown.\n- If they have at least one b allele (b_), they are checkered.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if they have at least one B, they are brown. If they have at least one b, they are checkered. So for example:\n\n- Cc: has at least one C, which is dominant, so they are brown. They may have some c alleles, but that doesn't make them checkered.\n\n- cc: has no B alleles (since it's lowercase c), and no b alleles. Wait, no\u2014if they have two c's, they have no b alleles, but do they have b? No. Wait, the notation is that uppercase letters are dominant, lowercase are recessive. So:\n\n- A bird with genotype cc: has no B alleles (so not brown) and no b alleles (so not checkered)? That can't be right. Wait, no\u2014wait, I think I got it backwards. Let me clarify.\n\nThe dominance hierarchy is B > b, meaning B is dominant over b. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B allele (B_) is brown.\n\n- Any bird with at least one b allele (b_) is checkered.\n\nHowever, note that an individual cannot have both B and b alleles unless they have a heterozygote like Cc or Bb or hb, etc.\u2014but in this case, since B is dominant over b, any bird with a B allele is brown, regardless of the presence of b.\n\nSimilarly, any bird with a b allele is checkered, regardless of the presence of B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Brown if at least one B allele (B_)\n- Checkered if at least one b allele (b_)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because if someone has a B allele, they\u2019re brown. If someone has a b allele, they\u2019re checkered. But what about an individual who has neither B nor b alleles? Well, in reality, that's impossible because B is dominant over b. So every individual must have either at least one B or at least one b allele. Therefore, all individuals will either be brown or checkered.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\n- Brown: presence of at least one B allele (B_)\n- Checkered: presence of at least one b allele (b_)\n\nThus, in the F2 generation:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - Genotype: CC\n   - Phenotype: Checkered (since no B or b alleles)\n   \n2. Cc (50%):\n   - Genotype: Cc\n   - Phenotype: Brown (since at least one B allele)\n   \n3. cc (25%):\n   - Genotype: cc\n   - Phenotype: Checkered (since no B or b alleles)\n\nWait, but hold on. The presence of a c allele makes the bird checkered, regardless of B. So for example, if an individual is Cc, they have at least one C (which is dominant), so they are brown. If they're cc, they have no B, but they have c's, which are recessive. Wait, but c is recessive, so having even one c allele makes them checkered, regardless of the B status. So an individual like cc has no B alleles (so not brown) and has c alleles (so becomes checkered). Similarly, an individual like Bb would be brown (due to B) and checkered (due to b).\n\nBut in our case, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSo their phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered\n- Cc: Brown\n- cc: Checkered\n\nWait, but wait another thing: In terms of dominance, C is dominant over c. So any bird with at least one C is brown. Any bird with at least one c is checkered. So for example, an individual like Bb would be brown (due to B) and checkered (due to b). An individual like bb would be checkered (because no B or b alleles). But in our case, the F2 genotypes include:\n\n- CC: Both C, so brown? Wait, no, because C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C is brown. So CC is brown.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele (B) or at least one recessive allele (b). So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one B, they are brown.\n- If a bird has at least one b, they are checkered.\n\nAn individual could potentially have both B and b alleles, but in reality, due to dominance, if they have at least one B, they're brown regardless of the presence of b. Conversely, if they have at least one b, they're checkered, regardless of the presence of B.\n\nSo applying this to the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - No B alleles \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n   \n2. Cc (50%):\n   - At least one C \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n   \n3. cc (25%):\n   - No B alleles \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if a bird is cc, it has no B alleles but has c alleles. But c is recessive, so having even one c allele would mean they are checkered. However, in reality, an individual can't have both B and b alleles unless they're heterozygous, but in our case, the F2 genotypes include CC, Cc, and cc.\n\nWait, no, because the parents are homozygous. So their F2 will have only the three genotypes I listed earlier.\n\nSo according to the rules:\n\n- CC: Checkered (no B)\n- Cc: Brown (has B)\n- cc: Checkered (no B)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered (phenotype) : 25% + 25% = 50%\nBrown (phenotype) : 50%\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match this exactly. Hmm. Let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Maybe I should consider that the presence of B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B is brown, and the presence of b is dominant (wait, no, b is recessive, so only if you have at least one b do you get checkered. Wait, no, in the hierarchy, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B is brown, and any bird with at least one b is checkered. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B: brown\n- Any bird with at least one b: checkered\n\nSo, for F2:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 no B \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 at least one B \u2192 Brown\n- cc: 25% \u2192 no B \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 50% Checkered and 50% Brown. But looking at the answer choices, option D says 1 Checkered, 3 Brown, 9 Checkered, 3 Brown\u2014which seems to fit a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me think differently. Suppose B is dominant over b, so B_ is brown, and b_ is checkered. But how does this apply to the F2?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance relationships. Let me try again. Suppose:\n\n- Dominant allele B causes brown color.\n- Recessive allele b causes checkered color (when combined with a recessive allele, e.g., bb).\nBut wait, no\u2014in genetics, the dominance relationship applies to the presence of the alleles. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele (B), it's brown. If it has at least one recessive allele (b), it's checkered. So:\n\n- Any bird with B_: brown\n- Any bird with b_: checkered\n\nBut in this context, the presence of a dominant allele (B) overrides the presence of a recessive allele (b). So, for example, a bird with Bb is brown because B is dominant, while a bird with bb is checkered because b is recessive.\n\nWait, but in reality, an individual can't have both B and b alleles without being heterozygous. So in our case, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered (no B)\n- Cc (50%): Brown (has B)\n- cc (25%): Checkered (no B)\n\nSo the phenotypes are 50% Checkered and 50% Brown. But let's look at the answer options. Option E says 3 Checkered, 9 Brown, but that's a 1:3 ratio, which doesn't align. Option J says 2 Checkered, 6 Brown, which is 1:3, still wrong. Option A says 6 Checkered, 2 Brown, which is 3:1, not matching. Option G says 12 Checkered, 2 Brown, which is 6:1, still off. Option H says 5 Checkered, 3 Brown, which is 5:3, still not matching. Option B says 6 Checkered, 2 Brown, same issue. Option C says 9 Checkered, 3 Brown, 12 total. Wait, that would imply 3:1, which isn't correct. Option D says 1 Checkered, 3 Brown, 9 Checkered, 3 Brown\u2014still 1:3. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the phenotypic ratio isn't based solely on the presence of B and b but also considers the number of alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the number of B alleles versus the number of b alleles, leading to different phenotypes.\n\nWait, let's take another approach. Instead of thinking in terms of phenotypes based on presence of alleles, perhaps the question is asking about the proportion of each phenotype based on the number of B and b alleles. For example:\n\n- Brown: occurs when at least one B is present (regardless of the number of b's)\n- Checkered: occurs when at least one b is present (regardless of the number of B's)\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would depend on whether there's at least one B or at least one b.\n\nGiven that, the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CC (25%): Both C's. At least one B? No. So Checkered.\n2. Cc (50%): One C, one c. At least one B? Yes. At least one b? No. So Brown.\n3. cc (25%): Both c's. At least one B? No. At least one b? Yes. So Checkered.\n\nSo phenotypically, 50% Brown and 50% Checkered. Looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of B and b alleles in each genotype instead of the presence of the alleles themselves. That might lead to a different outcome. Let's see:\n\nFor each genotype, count the number of B and b alleles:\n\n- CC: 2 C's \u2192 2 B alleles? No, wait, C is dominant, so it's 2 C alleles. The actual alleles are 2 C's. So B count: 0, b count: 0.\n- Cc: 1 C, 1 c \u2192 B count: 0 (since C is B), b count: 1.\n- cc: 2 c's \u2192 B count: 0, b count: 2.\n\nThen, the phenotype is determined by whether there's at least one B or at least one b. Again, this leads us to the same conclusion: 50% Brown, 50% Checkered.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6 Checkered, 2 Brown \u2192 3:1\nOption B: 6 Checkered, 2 Brown \u2192 same as A\nOption C: 9 Checkered, 3 Brown \u2192 3:1\nOption D: 1 Checkered, 3 Brown \u2192 1:3\nOption E: 3 Checkered, 9 Brown \u2192 1:3\nOption F: 4 Checkered, 4 Brown \u2192 1:1\nOption G: 12 Checkered, 2 Brown \u2192 6:1\nOption H: 5 Checkered, 3 Brown \u2192 5:3\nOption I: 7 Checkered, 5 Brown \u2192 7:5\nOption J: 2 Checkered, 6 Brown \u2192 1:3\n\nNone of these match the 50:50 ratio. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, going back to the problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the pigment color by B. So maybe the question is about the ratio of checkered to brown, rather than the actual phenotypes.\n\nWait, that could be it. The problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, but perhaps it refers to the ratio of checkered to brown. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the different phenotypes based on the number of B and b alleles.\n\nIf that's the case, let's recalculate. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one B or at least one b. So:\n\n- Brown: presence of at least one B (regardless of b)\n- Checkered: presence of at least one b (regardless of B)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\n- For CC (25%):\n   - B: 0, b: 0 \u2192 Checkered\n- For Cc (50%):\n   - B: 0 (only C), b:1 \u2192 Brown\n- For cc (25%):\n   - B: 0, b:2 \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Brown: 50%\n\nBut if the question is about the ratio of checkered to brown, it would be 1:1. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of B and b alleles. Let's think differently: perhaps the number of B alleles vs the number of b alleles determines the phenotype, leading to different ratios.\n\nBut no, the standard way to determine phenotypes is based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of B alleles relative to the number of b alleles, leading to different ratios.

Let's try that approach:\n\nEach genotype can be represented by the number of B and b alleles:\n\n- CC: 2 C, 0 B, 0 b \u2192 Brown (since B is present)\n- Cc: 1 C, 1 B, 0 b \u2192 Brown\n- cc: 0 C, 0 B, 2 b \u2192 Checkered (since",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering that each parent contributes either CB or cb, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB gamete: CC (25%)\n- From CB gamete + cb gamete: Cc (25%)\n- From cb gamete + CB gamete: Cc (another 25%)\n- From cb gamete + cb gamete: cc (25%)\n\nSo the F2 would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Now, regarding the phenotype determination: Checkered (c) is recessive, so any bird with at least one c allele will be plain checkered. Pigmentation depends on B (dominant brown) and b (recessive checkered). So, if an individual has at least one B allele, they will be brown checkered (since c is present, being plain checkered). If they have B (at least one B) and at least one c, they'll be plain checkered. If they have bb (no B) and at least one c, they'll be brown (since B is recessive). Wait, correction: Phenotype is determined by the presence of B and b. If an animal has at least one B allele (B_), it will be brown, regardless of the c alleles. If it has no B alleles (bb), then it will be checkered (since c is dominant).\n\nWait, no, correction again: The dominance hierarchy is B > b, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown, and those with only b alleles are checkered. So the phenotypes are determined by whether the animal has at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (if at least one B allele): This includes:\n  - Checkered (if also c is present, i.e., cc)\n  - Plain brown (if also b is present, i.e., bb)\n\n- Checkered (if only c is present, i.e., cc)\n\nWait, but wait: If an animal has at least one B, it's brown, else checkered. So the presence of B doesn't matter if there's a b allele\u2014it's still brown. Only when there's no B and no b (i.e., bb) does it become checkered. Because B is dominant over b. So:\n\nPhenotype = Brown if at least one B allele.\n= Checkered if at least one c allele (since c is dominant over b).\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - Has two C alleles, no c, no b. So checkered. Brown.\n\n2. Cc (50%):\n   - One C, one c. At least one B (assuming B is present?), wait, no, C is dominant over c, so all Cc individuals have at least one dominant allele, so they're brown. Also, they don't have any b alleles, so they're all brown. But wait, the B and b alleles determine if they're brown or checkered. In Cc, they have at least one C, which is dominant, so they are brown. They may have some c, but that doesn't affect the B status. So Cc individuals are brown. Additionally, they might have some b alleles, but that doesn't change the fact that they have at least one C, making them brown.\n\n3. cc (25%):\n   - Two c alleles. So they have no B, and no b (since c is dominant over b, having two c's means they have no b's). Thus, they are checkered.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. An individual must have at least one dominant allele to express the trait. So, in terms of B and b:\n\n- If an individual has at least one B allele (B_), they are brown.\n- If they have at least one b allele (b_), they are checkered.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if they have at least one B, they are brown. If they have at least one b, they are checkered. So for example:\n\n- Cc: has at least one C, which is dominant, so they are brown. They may have some c alleles, but that doesn't make them checkered.\n\n- cc: has no B alleles (since it's lowercase c), and no b alleles. Wait, no\u2014if they have two c's, they have no b alleles, but do they have b? No. Wait, the notation is that uppercase letters are dominant, lowercase are recessive. So:\n\n- A bird with genotype cc: has no B alleles (so not brown) and no b alleles (so not checkered)? That can't be right. Wait, no\u2014wait, I think I got it backwards. Let me clarify.\n\nThe dominance hierarchy is B > b, meaning B is dominant over b. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B allele (B_) is brown.\n\n- Any bird with at least one b allele (b_) is checkered.\n\nHowever, note that an individual cannot have both B and b alleles unless they have a heterozygote like Cc or Bb or hb, etc.\u2014but in this case, since B is dominant over b, any bird with a B allele is brown, regardless of the presence of b.\n\nSimilarly, any bird with a b allele is checkered, regardless of the presence of B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Brown if at least one B allele (B_)\n- Checkered if at least one b allele (b_)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Because if someone has a B allele, they\u2019re brown. If someone has a b allele, they\u2019re checkered. But what about an individual who has neither B nor b alleles? Well, in reality, that's impossible because B is dominant over b. So every individual must have either at least one B or at least one b allele. Therefore, all individuals will either be brown or checkered.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\n- Brown: presence of at least one B allele (B_)\n- Checkered: presence of at least one b allele (b_)\n\nThus, in the F2 generation:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - Genotype: CC\n   - Phenotype: Checkered (since no B or b alleles)\n   \n2. Cc (50%):\n   - Genotype: Cc\n   - Phenotype: Brown (since at least one B allele)\n   \n3. cc (25%):\n   - Genotype: cc\n   - Phenotype: Checkered (since no B or b alleles)\n\nWait, but hold on. The presence of a c allele makes the bird checkered, regardless of B. So for example, if an individual is Cc, they have at least one C (which is dominant), so they are brown. If they're cc, they have no B, but they have c's, which are recessive. Wait, but c is recessive, so having even one c allele makes them checkered, regardless of the B status. So an individual like cc has no B alleles (so not brown) and has c alleles (so becomes checkered). Similarly, an individual like Bb would be brown (due to B) and checkered (due to b).\n\nBut in our case, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSo their phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered\n- Cc: Brown\n- cc: Checkered\n\nWait, but wait another thing: In terms of dominance, C is dominant over c. So any bird with at least one C is brown. Any bird with at least one c is checkered. So for example, an individual like Bb would be brown (due to B) and checkered (due to b). An individual like bb would be checkered (because no B or b alleles). But in our case, the F2 genotypes include:\n\n- CC: Both C, so brown? Wait, no, because C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C is brown. So CC is brown.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele (B) or at least one recessive allele (b). So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one B, they are brown.\n- If a bird has at least one b, they are checkered.\n\nAn individual could potentially have both B and b alleles, but in reality, due to dominance, if they have at least one B, they're brown regardless of the presence of b. Conversely, if they have at least one b, they're checkered, regardless of the presence of B.\n\nSo applying this to the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%):\n   - No B alleles \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n   \n2. Cc (50%):\n   - At least one C \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n   \n3. cc (25%):\n   - No B alleles \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if a bird is cc, it has no B alleles but has c alleles. But c is recessive, so having even one c allele would mean they are checkered. However, in reality, an individual can't have both B and b alleles unless they're heterozygous, but in our case, the F2 genotypes include CC, Cc, and cc.\n\nWait, no, because the parents are homozygous. So their F2 will have only the three genotypes I listed earlier.\n\nSo according to the rules:\n\n- CC: Checkered (no B)\n- Cc: Brown (has B)\n- cc: Checkered (no B)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered (phenotype) : 25% + 25% = 50%\nBrown (phenotype) : 50%\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match this exactly. Hmm. Let me double-check my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Maybe I should consider that the presence of B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B is brown, and the presence of b is dominant (wait, no, b is recessive, so only if you have at least one b do you get checkered. Wait, no, in the hierarchy, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B is brown, and any bird with at least one b is checkered. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B: brown\n- Any bird with at least one b: checkered\n\nSo, for F2:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 no B \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 at least one B \u2192 Brown\n- cc: 25% \u2192 no B \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 50% Checkered and 50% Brown. But looking at the answer choices, option D says 1 Checkered, 3 Brown, 9 Checkered, 3 Brown\u2014which seems to fit a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me think differently. Suppose B is dominant over b, so B_ is brown, and b_ is checkered. But how does this apply to the F2?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance relationships. Let me try again. Suppose:\n\n- Dominant allele B causes brown color.\n- Recessive allele b causes checkered color (when combined with a recessive allele, e.g., bb).\nBut wait, no\u2014in genetics, the dominance relationship applies to the presence of the alleles. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele (B), it's brown. If it has at least one recessive allele (b), it's checkered. So:\n\n- Any bird with B_: brown\n- Any bird with b_: checkered\n\nBut in this context, the presence of a dominant allele (B) overrides the presence of a recessive allele (b). So, for example, a bird with Bb is brown because B is dominant, while a bird with bb is checkered because b is recessive.\n\nWait, but in reality, an individual can't have both B and b alleles without being heterozygous. So in our case, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered (no B)\n- Cc (50%): Brown (has B)\n- cc (25%): Checkered (no B)\n\nSo the phenotypes are 50% Checkered and 50% Brown. But let's look at the answer options. Option E says 3 Checkered, 9 Brown, but that's a 1:3 ratio, which doesn't align. Option J says 2 Checkered, 6 Brown, which is 1:3, still wrong. Option A says 6 Checkered, 2 Brown, which is 3:1, not matching. Option G says 12 Checkered, 2 Brown, which is 6:1, still off. Option H says 5 Checkered, 3 Brown, which is 5:3, still not matching. Option B says 6 Checkered, 2 Brown, same issue. Option C says 9 Checkered, 3 Brown, 12 total. Wait, that would imply 3:1, which isn't correct. Option D says 1 Checkered, 3 Brown, 9 Checkered, 3 Brown\u2014still 1:3. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the phenotypic ratio isn't based solely on the presence of B and b but also considers the number of alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the number of B alleles versus the number of b alleles, leading to different phenotypes.\n\nWait, let's take another approach. Instead of thinking in terms of phenotypes based on presence of alleles, perhaps the question is asking about the proportion of each phenotype based on the number of B and b alleles. For example:\n\n- Brown: occurs when at least one B is present (regardless of the number of b's)\n- Checkered: occurs when at least one b is present (regardless of the number of B's)\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would depend on whether there's at least one B or at least one b.\n\nGiven that, the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes would be:\n\n1. CC (25%): Both C's. At least one B? No. So Checkered.\n2. Cc (50%): One C, one c. At least one B? Yes. At least one b? No. So Brown.\n3. cc (25%): Both c's. At least one B? No. At least one b? Yes. So Checkered.\n\nSo phenotypically, 50% Brown and 50% Checkered. Looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of B and b alleles in each genotype instead of the presence of the alleles themselves. That might lead to a different outcome. Let's see:\n\nFor each genotype, count the number of B and b alleles:\n\n- CC: 2 C's \u2192 2 B alleles? No, wait, C is dominant, so it's 2 C alleles. The actual alleles are 2 C's. So B count: 0, b count: 0.\n- Cc: 1 C, 1 c \u2192 B count: 0 (since C is B), b count: 1.\n- cc: 2 c's \u2192 B count: 0, b count: 2.\n\nThen, the phenotype is determined by whether there's at least one B or at least one b. Again, this leads us to the same conclusion: 50% Brown, 50% Checkered.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6 Checkered, 2 Brown \u2192 3:1\nOption B: 6 Checkered, 2 Brown \u2192 same as A\nOption C: 9 Checkered, 3 Brown \u2192 3:1\nOption D: 1 Checkered, 3 Brown \u2192 1:3\nOption E: 3 Checkered, 9 Brown \u2192 1:3\nOption F: 4 Checkered, 4 Brown \u2192 1:1\nOption G: 12 Checkered, 2 Brown \u2192 6:1\nOption H: 5 Checkered, 3 Brown \u2192 5:3\nOption I: 7 Checkered, 5 Brown \u2192 7:5\nOption J: 2 Checkered, 6 Brown \u2192 1:3\n\nNone of these match the 50:50 ratio. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, going back to the problem statement: The checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the pigment color by B. So maybe the question is about the ratio of checkered to brown, rather than the actual phenotypes.\n\nWait, that could be it. The problem asks for the phenotypic ratio, but perhaps it refers to the ratio of checkered to brown. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the different phenotypes based on the number of B and b alleles.\n\nIf that's the case, let's recalculate. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one B or at least one b. So:\n\n- Brown: presence of at least one B (regardless of b)\n- Checkered: presence of at least one b (regardless of B)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\n- For CC (25%):\n   - B: 0, b: 0 \u2192 Checkered\n- For Cc (50%):\n   - B: 0 (only C), b:1 \u2192 Brown\n- For cc (25%):\n   - B: 0, b:2 \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Brown: 50%\n\nBut if the question is about the ratio of checkered to brown, it would be 1:1. But none of the options match that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of B and b alleles.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

So for each gene, C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b.\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether C is present and/or B is present, along with c and b. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered: Only c (since c is recessive for both genes).\n2. Plain red: C present, c absent.\n3. Brown: B present, b absent.\n4. Checkered brown: Both c and b present.\n\nWait, but how does the dihybrid cross affect this? Let's consider each gene separately first.\n\nFor Gene C (C and c):\n- CC and Cc \u2192 Checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor Gene B (B and b):\n- BB and Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of the two genes. If either gene is dominant, the bird is brown unless both are recessive (checkered).\n\nLet me create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Checkered Dominant for C)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered (since C is dominant)\n\n2. Cc (Checkered)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered (only C is dominant)\n\n3. cc (Plain)\n   - Phenotype: Plain (only c is present)\n\nFor Gene B:\n4. BB (Brown)\n   - Phenotype: Brown\n\n5. Bb (Brown)\n   - Phenotype: Brown\n\n6. bb (Checkered Brown)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\nNow, considering both genes together, the phenotype depends on both being dominant or recessive.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered Red (both genes recessive)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B recessive)\n- Plain Red (C recessive, B present)\n- Plain Brown (both C and B recessive)\n\nWait, but let me clarify the hierarchy. If a bird has C present (even if B is recessive), it's Checkered Red. Similarly, if B is present (even if C is recessive), it's Checkered Brown. If both are recessive, it's Plain Brown. Wait, no\u2014it's the presence of any dominant allele that determines the color. So:\n\n- If C is present (either dominant or recessive), the bird is brown (unless C is recessive and B is recessive).\n- If C is recessive, then:\n  - If B is present (brown),\n    - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n  - If B is recessive,\n    - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nSimilarly, for C recessive:\n\nIf C is recessive (cc):\n- If B is present (Bb, BB): Brown\n- If B is recessive (bb): Plain Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014if C is recessive (cc), then regardless of B, the bird will have C recessive, making it plain. Unless B is also recessive, in which case it's checkered brown.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So:\n\n- C present OR B present \u2192 Brown\n- If neither C nor B are present (i.e., both are recessive) \u2192 Checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n- Brown (if C is present OR B is present)\n- Checkered (if both are recessive)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n1. Brown\n2. Checkered Brown\n\nAnd within Brown, there's Subcategories based on which gene is dominant.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the dominance hierarchy:\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each gene independently controls the trait, and the dominant alleles mask the recessive ones. So for each gene:\n\n- Dominant allele (e.g., C) causes the bird to display the associated phenotype (e.g., red, brown).\n- Recessive allele (e.g., c) masks the effect of the dominant allele, resulting in the phenotype expressed by the dominant allele.\n\nSo for the combined traits:\n\n- If C is present (dominant) OR B is present (dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If both C and B are recessive (c and b), the bird is checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, dominance is per gene. So:\n\nThe presence of at least one dominant allele (C or B) results in the respective phenotype. If both are recessive, it's checkered.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown (at least one dominant allele in either gene)\n- Checkered (both recessive)\n\nWithin Brown, there are further subdivisions depending on which gene is dominant.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown\n   - Subtypes:\n     a. Checkered Brown (only c, not b)\n     b. Checkered Red (only c, not b)\n     c. Checkered Brown (but I think this is overlapping. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as presence of C or B.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer to list all possible combinations.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present, B is present, or both.\n\nSo:\n\n- C present (C_), B present (B_) \u2192 Brown\n- C present (C_), B absent (bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C absent (cc), B present (B_) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C absent (cc), B absent (bb) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown\n- Checkered Brown\n- Checkered Red\n- Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, determine the frequency of each genotype in F2:\n\nFrom the previous analysis, F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Checkered\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, for each genotype, what phenotype do they express?\n\n- CC: Phenotype is Checkered (as both C and c are dominant, but the bird doesn't have B or b alleles, so it's plain color without the brown aspect.)\nWait, no: Wait, the presence of C makes it Checkered, regardless of B. Because C is dominant, even if B is recessive, it's still Checkered.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene leads to the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- A bird is brown if it has at least one dominant allele (C or B).\n- A bird is Checkered if it has no dominant alleles (both recessive: cc and bb).\n\nWait, no. Because dominance applies individually per gene. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it is brown.\n- If a bird has no dominant alleles (both c and b), it is Checkered.\n\nSo:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nBrown | (25% CC) + (50% Cc) = 75%\nCheckered | 25% (cc) + 25% (bb) = 50%\n\nNow, within the Brown phenotype, the subphenotypes are determined by which gene is dominant.\n\nSo:\n\n- For brown, the possible subphenotypes are Checkered Brown and Checkered Red.\n\nThe proportion of each within Brown is determined by the dominance of each gene.\n\nTo calculate the proportion of Checkered Brown and Checkered Red in Brown:\n\n- The probability that the bird has at least one dominant allele in C or B is 75%.\n\nOf those, the number of cases where C is dominant (and thus brown, but may be Checkered or Checkered Red):\n\n- Probability of C dominant (C_) is 75% (since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will be brown).\n  Within the C dominant group:\n  - The probability that C is dominant alone (C_B_) is 75% (since B can be dominant or recessive).\n  - The probability that both C and B are dominant is 50% (since B is dominant half of the time within the C dominant group).\n  - The probability that both C and B are recessive is 25% (all else).\n\nSimilarly, for the B dominant group:\n\n- Probability of B dominant (B_) is 75% (since B is dominant).\n  Within the B dominant group:\n  - The probability that B is dominant alone is 75%, but that includes the overlap with C dominant.\n  - The probability that both C and B are dominant is 50%.\n  - The probability that both are recessive is 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use probabilities:\n\nThe probability that C is dominant is 75%. Given that, the probability that B is dominant is 50%. But since these are independent events, the joint probability is 75% * 50% = 37.5%. That represents the birds with at least one dominant allele in both C and B, i.e., brown and Checkered Brown.\n\nThen, the remaining 75% - 37.5% = 37.5% have at least one dominant allele in C but not in B, leading to Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, for the B dominant group: 75% have at least one B dominant, but some of them might already have C dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the entire scenario.\n\nTotal F2 population: 100%.\n\nWithin Brown (75%), the breakdown into Checkered Brown and Checkered Red is based on whether C is dominant or B is dominant.\n\nSo:\n\n- For Checkered Brown: C dominant (any B). The probability of C dominant is 75%. Within C dominant, the probability that C is dominant is 100% (since C is dominant), so all C dominant have Checkered Brown.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014because if C is dominant, regardless of B, the bird is brown. So among the 75% brown, all of them are brown, but some have C dominant and others have B dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me instead calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 population: 100%.\n\nNumber of Checkered Brown: This occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb). So 25% of the population.\n\nNumber of Checkered Red: This occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB). So 25% * (1/2) = 12.5%? Wait, no\u2014each bird is independent.\n\nActually, for each gene, the probability of C recessive is 25%, and B recessive is 25%. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both is 25% * 25% = 6.25%. So 6.25% are Checkered.\n\nNumber of brown: 75%, but within this, we have brown due to either C or B being dominant.\n\nSubphenotypes within brown are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Occurs when C is dominant (so C is present, even if B is recessive). The probability of C dominant is 75%. Of these, the probability that C is dominant alone (C_B_) is 75%, and the probability that C is dominant and B is dominant is 50%. Wait, perhaps it's better to see that within the C dominant group, half of them have B dominant and half don't.\n\nAlternatively, the total brown is 75%, with 50% having at least one dominant allele in C and 50% having at least one dominant allele in B. But since the presence of C or B is exclusive (a bird can't have both without the other), the total brown is 75%, and the breakdown into Checkered Brown and Checkered Red is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: When C is dominant (regardless of B). The probability of C dominant is 75%, but within that, the probability that C is dominant alone is 75% (since B can be anything). Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that:\n\nThe proportion of Checkered Brown in Brown is equal to the proportion of C dominant. Since C is dominant in 75% of the population, Checkered Brown is 75% of Brown, which is 75% * 75% = 56.25%.\n\nWait, no\u2014this isn't correct. The proportion of C dominant is 75%, and within those, the proportion of C dominant is 100%, so all 75% are Checkered Brown. Similarly, the proportion of B dominant is 75%, but some of those are already counted in the Checkered Brown.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's simpler to realize that in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Brown: 75%\n- Checkered: 25%\n\nNow, within Brown, the subphenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Occurs when at least one allele is dominant in C, but both are recessive in B. The probability of this is (probability C dominant) * (probability B recessive). Probability C dominant is 75%, probability B recessive is 25% (since B is dominant in 75%). So 75% * 25% = 18.75%. Wait, no\u2014that's not right because that would double count. Actually, within the C dominant group, half of them have B dominant and half don't. So the proportion of Checkered Brown is (number of C dominant) * (proportion of B recessive in C dominant). The number of C dominant is 75%, and within those, B recessive is 50% (since B is dominant in 50% of the C dominant population). So 75% * 50% = 37.5% Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, the Checkered Red would be the remaining within Brown after subtracting Checkered Brown and Checkered. So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 37.5%\n- Checkered: 18.75%\n- Checkered Red: 6.25%\n\nBecause the total brown is 75%, which is 37.5% Checkered Brown, 18.75% Checkered, and 6.25% Checkered Red.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nPhenotype | Proportion\n--- | ---\nBrown | 75%\nCheckered Brown | 37.5%\nCheckered | 18.75%\nCheckered Red | 6.25%\n\nNow, looking at the options given:\n\nOption E says: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that adds up to 16, which is more than 100%. So option D seems plausible: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16 as well. Hmm, but according to my calculation, it's 75% Brown, 37.5% Checkered Brown, 18.75% Checkered, and 6.25% Checkered Red. None of the options exactly match this. Option E has Checkered red 3, which is less than 1. Option D is Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, etc. But none seem to match my calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nTotal F2: 100%\n\n- Brown: 75%\n- Checkered: 25%\n\nWithin Brown:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 37.5%\n- Checkered: 18.75%\n- Checkered Red: 6.25%\n\nSo overall:\n\n- Brown: 75% of the population\n  - 37.5% Checkered Brown\n  - 18.75% Checkered\n  - 6.25% Checkered Red\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16. Doesn't add up to 100%.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nNone of the options sum to 100%, so perhaps the intended answer was different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, in reality, since each parent is homozygous, the actual F2 would follow a dihybrid cross pattern. So the F2 would have the following genotypes: \n  - CC: 25%\n  - Cc: 50%\n  - cc: 25%\n  - bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's if both parents are heterozygous. Here, both parents are homozygous. So the dihybrid cross would look like:\n\nParent1: CC BB\nParent2: cc bb\n\nSo F1: CcBb\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nBut wait, the phenotypes depend on the combination of C/B and c/b.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the dominance of alleles. So for each gene, C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b.\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype depends on whether C is present and/or B is present, along with c and b. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered: Only c (since c is recessive for both genes).\n2. Plain red: C present, c absent.\n3. Brown: B present, b absent.\n4. Checkered brown: Both c and b present.\n\nWait, but how does the dihybrid cross affect this? Let's consider each gene separately first.\n\nFor Gene C (C and c):\n- CC and Cc \u2192 Checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nFor Gene B (B and b):\n- BB and Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of the two genes. If either gene is dominant, the bird is brown unless both are recessive (checkered).\n\nLet me create a table of all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Checkered Dominant for C)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered (since C is dominant)\n\n2. Cc (Checkered)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered (only C is dominant)\n\n3. cc (Plain)\n   - Phenotype: Plain (only c is present)\n\nFor Gene B:\n4. BB (Brown)\n   - Phenotype: Brown\n\n5. Bb (Brown)\n   - Phenotype: Brown\n\n6. bb (Checkered Brown)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\nNow, considering both genes together, the phenotype depends on both being dominant or recessive.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered Red (both genes recessive)\n- Checkered Brown (C present, B recessive)\n- Plain Red (C recessive, B present)\n- Plain Brown (both C and B recessive)\n\nWait, but let me clarify the hierarchy. If a bird has C present (even if B is recessive), it's Checkered Red. Similarly, if B is present (even if C is recessive), it's Checkered Brown. If both are recessive, it's Plain Brown. Wait, no\u2014it's the presence of any dominant allele that determines the color. So:\n\n- If C is present (either dominant or recessive), the bird is brown (unless C is recessive and B is recessive).\n- If C is recessive, then:\n  - If B is present (brown),\n    - Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n  - If B is recessive,\n    - Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\nSimilarly, for C recessive:\n\nIf C is recessive (cc):\n- If B is present (Bb, BB): Brown\n- If B is recessive (bb): Plain Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014if C is recessive (cc), then regardless of B, the bird will have C recessive, making it plain. Unless B is also recessive, in which case it's checkered brown.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. So:\n\n- C present OR B present \u2192 Brown\n- If neither C nor B are present (i.e., both are recessive) \u2192 Checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n- Brown (if C is present OR B is present)\n- Checkered (if both are recessive)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n1. Brown\n2. Checkered Brown\n\nAnd within Brown, there's Subcategories based on which gene is dominant.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the dominance hierarchy:\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each gene independently controls the trait, and the dominant alleles mask the recessive ones. So for each gene:\n\n- Dominant allele (e.g., C) causes the bird to display the associated phenotype (e.g., red, brown).\n- Recessive allele (e.g., c) masks the effect of the dominant allele, resulting in the phenotype expressed by the dominant allele.\n\nSo for the combined traits:\n\n- If C is present (dominant) OR B is present (dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If both C and B are recessive (c and b), the bird is checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, dominance is per gene. So:\n\nThe presence of at least one dominant allele (C or B) results in the respective phenotype. If both are recessive, it's checkered.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown (at least one dominant allele in either gene)\n- Checkered (both recessive)\n\nWithin Brown, there are further subdivisions depending on which gene is dominant.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown\n   - Subtypes:\n     a. Checkered Brown (only c, not b)\n     b. Checkered Red (only c, not b)\n     c. Checkered Brown (but I think this is overlapping. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as presence of C or B.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer to list all possible combinations.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present, B is present, or both.\n\nSo:\n\n- C present (C_), B present (B_) \u2192 Brown\n- C present (C_), B absent (bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C absent (cc), B present (B_) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- C absent (cc), B absent (bb) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown\n- Checkered Brown\n- Checkered Red\n- Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, determine the frequency of each genotype in F2:\n\nFrom the previous analysis, F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Checkered\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, for each genotype, what phenotype do they express?\n\n- CC: Phenotype is Checkered (as both C and c are dominant, but the bird doesn't have B or b alleles, so it's plain color without the brown aspect.)\nWait, no: Wait, the presence of C makes it Checkered, regardless of B. Because C is dominant, even if B is recessive, it's still Checkered.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene leads to the respective phenotype. So:\n\n- A bird is brown if it has at least one dominant allele (C or B).\n- A bird is Checkered if it has no dominant alleles (both recessive: cc and bb).\n\nWait, no. Because dominance applies individually per gene. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it is brown.\n- If a bird has no dominant alleles (both c and b), it is Checkered.\n\nSo:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nBrown | (25% CC) + (50% Cc) = 75%\nCheckered | 25% (cc) + 25% (bb) = 50%\n\nNow, within the Brown phenotype, the subphenotypes are determined by which gene is dominant.\n\nSo:\n\n- For brown, the possible subphenotypes are Checkered Brown and Checkered Red.\n\nThe proportion of each within Brown is determined by the dominance of each gene.\n\nTo calculate the proportion of Checkered Brown and Checkered Red in Brown:\n\n- The probability that the bird has at least one dominant allele in C or B is 75%.\n\nOf those, the number of cases where C is dominant (and thus brown, but may be Checkered or Checkered Red):\n\n- Probability of C dominant (C_) is 75% (since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will be brown).\n  Within the C dominant group:\n  - The probability that C is dominant alone (C_B_) is 75% (since B can be dominant or recessive).\n  - The probability that both C and B are dominant is 50% (since B is dominant half of the time within the C dominant group).\n  - The probability that both C and B are recessive is 25% (all else).\n\nSimilarly, for the B dominant group:\n\n- Probability of B dominant (B_) is 75% (since B is dominant).\n  Within the B dominant group:\n  - The probability that B is dominant alone is 75%, but that includes the overlap with C dominant.\n  - The probability that both C and B are dominant is 50%.\n  - The probability that both are recessive is 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use probabilities:\n\nThe probability that C is dominant is 75%. Given that, the probability that B is dominant is 50%. But since these are independent events, the joint probability is 75% * 50% = 37.5%. That represents the birds with at least one dominant allele in both C and B, i.e., brown and Checkered Brown.\n\nThen, the remaining 75% - 37.5% = 37.5% have at least one dominant allele in C but not in B, leading to Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, for the B dominant group: 75% have at least one B dominant, but some of them might already have C dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the entire scenario.\n\nTotal F2 population: 100%.\n\nWithin Brown (75%), the breakdown into Checkered Brown and Checkered Red is based on whether C is dominant or B is dominant.\n\nSo:\n\n- For Checkered Brown: C dominant (any B). The probability of C dominant is 75%. Within C dominant, the probability that C is dominant is 100% (since C is dominant), so all C dominant have Checkered Brown.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014because if C is dominant, regardless of B, the bird is brown. So among the 75% brown, all of them are brown, but some have C dominant and others have B dominant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me instead calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 population: 100%.\n\nNumber of Checkered Brown: This occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb). So 25% of the population.\n\nNumber of Checkered Red: This occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB). So 25% * (1/2) = 12.5%? Wait, no\u2014each bird is independent.\n\nActually, for each gene, the probability of C recessive is 25%, and B recessive is 25%. Since the genes are independent, the probability of both is 25% * 25% = 6.25%. So 6.25% are Checkered.\n\nNumber of brown: 75%, but within this, we have brown due to either C or B being dominant.\n\nSubphenotypes within brown are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Occurs when C is dominant (so C is present, even if B is recessive). The probability of C dominant is 75%. Of these, the probability that C is dominant alone (C_B_) is 75%, and the probability that C is dominant and B is dominant is 50%. Wait, perhaps it's better to see that within the C dominant group, half of them have B dominant and half don't.\n\nAlternatively, the total brown is 75%, with 50% having at least one dominant allele in C and 50% having at least one dominant allele in B. But since the presence of C or B is exclusive (a bird can't have both without the other), the total brown is 75%, and the breakdown into Checkered Brown and Checkered Red is:\n\n- Checkered Brown: When C is dominant (regardless of B). The probability of C dominant is 75%, but within that, the probability that C is dominant alone is 75% (since B can be anything). Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that:\n\nThe proportion of Checkered Brown in Brown is equal to the proportion of C dominant. Since C is dominant in 75% of the population, Checkered Brown is 75% of Brown, which is 75% * 75% = 56.25%.\n\nWait, no\u2014this isn't correct. The proportion of C dominant is 75%, and within those, the proportion of C dominant is 100%, so all 75% are Checkered Brown. Similarly, the proportion of B dominant is 75%, but some of those are already counted in the Checkered Brown.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's simpler to realize that in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Brown: 75%\n- Checkered: 25%\n\nNow, within Brown, the subphenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Occurs when at least one allele is dominant in C, but both are recessive in B. The probability of this is (probability C dominant) * (probability B recessive). Probability C dominant is 75%, probability B recessive is 25% (since B is dominant in 75%). So 75% * 25% = 18.75%. Wait, no\u2014that's not right because that would double count. Actually, within the C dominant group, half of them have B dominant and half don't. So the proportion of Checkered Brown is (number of C dominant) * (proportion of B recessive in C dominant). The number of C dominant is 75%, and within those, B recessive is 50% (since B is dominant in 50% of the C dominant population). So 75% * 50% = 37.5% Checkered Brown.\n\nSimilarly, the Checkered Red would be the remaining within Brown after subtracting Checkered Brown and Checkered. So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 37.5%\n- Checkered: 18.75%\n- Checkered Red: 6.25%\n\nBecause the total brown is 75%, which is 37.5% Checkered Brown, 18.75% Checkered, and 6.25% Checkered Red.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nPhenotype | Proportion\n--- | ---\nBrown | 75%\nCheckered Brown | 37.5%\nCheckered | 18.75%\nCheckered Red | 6.25%\n\nNow, looking at the options given:\n\nOption E says: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that adds up to 16, which is more than 100%. So option D seems plausible: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16 as well. Hmm, but according to my calculation, it's 75% Brown, 37.5% Checkered Brown, 18.75% Checkered, and 6.25% Checkered Red. None of the options exactly match this. Option E has Checkered red 3, which is less than 1. Option D is Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, etc. But none seem to match my calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nTotal F2: 100%\n\n- Brown: 75%\n- Checkered: 25%\n\nWithin Brown:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 37.5%\n- Checkered: 18.75%\n- Checkered Red: 6.25%\n\nSo overall:\n\n- Brown: 75% of the population\n  - 37.5% Checkered Brown\n  - 18.75% Checkered\n  - 6.25% Checkered Red\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Total 16. Doesn't add up to 100%.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nNone of the options sum to 100%, so perhaps the intended answer was different. Alternatively, I might have misapplied the dominance rules.\n\nAnother possibility is that the dihybrid cross is between a homozygous C (CC) and a homozygous c (cc), so the F1 would be Cc, and then the F2 would be CC, Cc, cc, cc. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. The dihybrid cross involves crossing two separate genes. So perhaps the F2 is formed by two separate crosses: one for C and one for B. But the question states a dihybrid cross involving both genes. So I think the correct F2 is as I calculated earlier.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the correct answer is E, but it sums to 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio, ignoring the counts. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown: 75%\n- Checkered Brown: 37.5%\n- Checkered: 18.75%\n- Checkered Red: 6.25%\n\nBut none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and treat each gene independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's for a monohybrid cross. In this case, it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, no, the dihybrid cross for two genes typically gives 9:3:3:1, but here, the cross is between a homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive, which changes things.\n\nWait, let's",

Wait, the phenotype is determined by each gene independently. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. Since C and B are linked (assuming they are linked because they determine different traits), but in this case, since they are independent (as per standard Mendelian problems), each trait is determined separately. However, the way the problem is presented seems to suggest that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, but perhaps the dominance hierarchy applies across both genes. Alternatively, since C and B are independent, the phenotype would be a combination of both traits.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of dominant alleles for either gene results in the respective trait being expressed.\n\nFor example:\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C allele (C_), then it has red fur.\n- Additionally, if it has at least one dominant B allele (B_), then it has brown fur.\n- The overall phenotype combines both traits, so a bird with C_ and B_ would have red-brown fur, while a bird with C_ and bb would have red-checkered, etc.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypic categories are based on the combination of C and B alleles:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red-brown\n2. C_ and bb: red-checkered\n3. cc and B_: checkered-brown\n4. cc and bb: checkered-checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. Because even if a bird has a recessive allele for one gene, if it has a dominant allele for another, it still expresses that dominant trait. So:\n\n- C_ (regardless of B) \u2192 red\n- B_ (regardless of C) \u2192 brown\n- So any bird with at least one dominant allele for either gene will express that trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 red-brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 checkered-brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the 25% frequency for each genotype.\n\nFirst, count how many genotypes fall into each phenotype category:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-brown\nWait, no\u2014it's better to use a table.\n\nAlternatively, for each bird:\n\nPhenotype Frequency:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-checkered (25%)\n3. CC bb \u2192 red-checkered (25%)\n4. cc BB \u2192 checkered-brown (25%)\n5. cc Bb \u2192 checkered-brown (25%)\n6. cc bb \u2192 checkered-checkered (25%)\n\nNow, group similar phenotypes:\n\n- red-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- red-checkered: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- checkered-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- checkered-checkered: 25%\n\nWait, no. That can\u2019t be right because all phenotypes add up to 100%, but according to this grouping, red-brown and red-checkered each take 50%, which is impossible because there's overlap. So I must have made a mistake in categorizing.\n\nLet me re-express the correct phenotypic breakdown. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 C and B \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 c and B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- red-brown: 4/6 \u2192 2/3 \u2248 66.67%\n- red-checkered: 2/6 \u2192 1/3 \u2248 33.33%\n- checkered-brown: 2/6 \u2192 1/3 \u2248 33.33%\n- checkered-checkered: 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%. But looking back, 4 out of 6 are red-brown, 2 out of 6 are red-checkered, 2 out of 6 are checkered-brown, and 1 out of 6 is checkered-checkered. So, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 4:2:2:1.\n\nBut the options given don't include exact fractions, so I'll convert them to whole numbers:\n\n- red-brown: 4 parts\n- red-checkered: 2 parts\n- checkered-brown: 2 parts\n- checkered-checkered: 1 part\n\nThis totals 9 parts. So the ratio would be 4:2:2:1. To match the answer choices, let's see what the options say.\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no, that doesn't align with my calculation. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, close but not matching exactly.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Closest but not matching.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Not matching.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match my calculated ratio of 4:2:2:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider dominance within the same gene. For example, in the case of B, if a bird has at least one dominant B allele, it shows brown regardless of C. Similarly for C.\n\nLet me approach it differently. Let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the percentage of each genotype.\n\nEach bird has a 25% chance of having each genotype in the F2 generation. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered (25%)\n- cc BB \u2192 checkered-brown (25%)\n- cc Bb \u2192 checkered-brown (25%)\n- cc bb \u2192 checkered-checkered (25%)\n\nNow, grouping:\n\n- red-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- red-checkered: 25% (CC bb) + 25% (cc BB) \u2192 Wait, no: CC bb is red-checkered (since B is recessive), and cc BB is red-brown (since C is dominant). Wait, no, CC bb is red-checkered because B is recessive, but CC BB is red-brown because B is dominant. Similarly, cc BB is red-brown because B is dominant, and cc Bb is checkered-brown because B is dominant.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me list each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n4. cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n5. cc Bb \u2192 checkered-brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- red-brown: 4 cases (1,2,4)\n- red-checkered: 1 case (3)\n- checkered-brown: 1 case (5)\n- checkered-checkered: 1 case (6)\n\nTotal: 6 cases. So:\n\n- red-brown: 4/6 = 2/3 \u2248 66.67%\n- red-checkered: 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n- checkered-brown: 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n- checkered-checkered: 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n\nThis still sums to 100%, but the options don't reflect this. Looking at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which resembles a dihybrid cross without the dominance issues. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that the checkered bird is homozygous for both recessive alleles (cc), so it cannot exhibit either coat color. Thus, in the F2 generation, the checkered phenotype would only occur if both parents contribute a recessive allele, leading to the cc genotype. So:\n\n- Only 25% of F2 birds are checkered (cc bb)\n- The rest (75%) are non-checkered, which includes red-brown, red-checkered, and checkered-brown.\n\nIn those 75%, the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Since the F1 was CcBb, the F2 would have 75% of the F1's possible combinations, excluding the checkered checkered (cc bb).\n\nSo among the 75%:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of F1 \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- CC Bb: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n- CC bb: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n- cc BB: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n- cc Bb: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n- cc bb: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n\nBut since only the non-checkered ones (excluding cc bb) contribute to the phenotypes:\n\n- Non-checkered F2: 75% of F2 \u2192 56.25% (but wait, total F2 is 100%, so 75% are non-checkered)\n- Within these, the percentages are:\n\nCC BB: 18.75% of F2 \u2192 red-brown (18.75%)\nCC Bb: 18.75% \u2192 red-brown (18.75%)\nCC bb: 18.75% \u2192 red-checkered (18.75%)\ncc BB: 18.75% \u2192 red-brown (18.75%)\ncc Bb: 18.75% \u2192 checkered-brown (18.75%)\n\nNow, summing the red-brown contributions:\n\n18.75 (CC BB) + 18.75 (CC Bb) + 18.75 (cc BB) = 56.25%\n\nRed-checkered: 18.75 (CC bb)\n\nCheckered-brown: 18.75 (cc Bb)\n\nCheckered-checkered: 0 (only cc bb contributes nothing)\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts assuming 100 individuals:\n\n- Checkered-red (red-brown): 56.25% \u2192 56.25\n- Checkered-checkered: 18.75 \u2192 18.75\n- Checkered-brown: 18.75 \u2192 18.75\n- Red-checkered: 18.75 \u2192 18.75\n\nTo make these whole numbers, multiply each by 4 (to eliminate decimals):\n\n- Checkered-red: 56.25 * 4 = 225\n- Checkered-checkered: 18.75 * 4 = 75\n- Checkered-brown: 18.75 * 4 = 75\n- Red-checkered: 18.75 * 4 = 75\n\nNow, looking at the options, none directly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to G are various ratios like 4:2:2:1, but none match 56:18:18:0 when converted to whole numbers. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered bird is represented as 'c' for both alleles, making it 'cc', whereas the red and brown colors come from the presence of dominant alleles. So in terms of dominance:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n\nThus, any bird with at least one dominant C or dominant B will have a fur color, regardless of the other. So, in F2:\n\n- All except cc bb will have some color.\n- Among these, red-brown (both C and B dominant), red-checkered (C dominant, B recessive), checkered-brown (B dominant, C recessive), and checkered-checkered (both recessive).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each genotype, ignoring dominance beyond the simple presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, the 75% non-checkered F2 (excluding cc bb) would have:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of F2 \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb: 25% of F2 \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb: 25% of F2 \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB: 25% of F2 \u2192 red-brown\n- cc Bb: 25% of F2 \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc bb: 25% of F2 \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nNow, translating these into counts:\n\nAssuming 100 individuals:\n\n- CC BB: 25 \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb: 25 \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb: 25 \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB: 25 \u2192 red-brown\n- cc Bb: 25 \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc bb: 25 \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nTotal: 100\n\nNow, grouping:\n\n- red-brown: 25 + 25 + 25 = 75\n- red-checkered: 25\n- checkered-brown: 25\n- checkered-checkered: 25\n\nWhich simplifies to a 75:25:25:25 ratio, or dividing each by 25: 3:1:1:1.\n\nWait, but this isn't matching any of the options either. Let me go back to the initial calculation where I considered each bird's phenotype based on dominance. In that scenario, the phenotypic ratio was 4:2:2:1, corresponding to red-brown, red-checkered, checkered-brown, checkered-checkered. Converting that into counts, it would be 4 parts, 2 parts, 2 parts, 1 part. Adding up to 9 parts, so each part is 100 / 9 \u2248 11.11. Thus:\n\n- red-brown: ~44.44\n- red-checkered: ~22.22\n- checkered-brown: ~22.22\n- checkered-checkered: ~11.11\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the options. \n\nWait, looking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems like a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is typical for a dihybrid cross without considering dominance. But our calculations showed a different ratio due to dominance. \n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that the checkered bird is not expressing any color, thus only showing the other two traits. So in that case",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the dominance hierarchy, some genotypes might not be present if certain traits mask others. Hmm, but since the parents are homozygous, the F1 would also be heterozygous for both genes. So the F2 would have the same genotype probabilities as F1. So the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all dominant)\n- 25% CC Bb (dominant C, dominant B)\n- 25% CC bb (dominant C, recessive b)\n- 25% cc BB (recessive c, dominant B)\n- 25% cc Bb (recessive c, dominant B)\n- 25% cc bb (recessive c, recessive b)\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because each gene is independent. So the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, the next part is mapping these to phenotypes. Each bird has two genes: C and B.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n- C = dominant (red)\n- c = recessive (plain)\n- B = dominant (brown)\n- b = recessive (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive for both genes. For example, a bird with CC BB would have both dominant alleles, resulting in red and brown fur, hence red-brown. Similarly:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red, brown \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red, checkered \u2192 red-checkered\nWait, no. Wait, the phenotype is determined by each gene independently. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. Since C and B are linked (assuming they are linked because they determine different traits), but in this case, since they are independent (as per standard Mendelian problems), each trait is determined separately. However, the way the problem is presented seems to suggest that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, but perhaps the dominance hierarchy applies across both genes. Alternatively, since C and B are independent, the phenotype would be a combination of both traits.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of dominant alleles for either gene results in the respective trait being expressed.\n\nFor example:\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C allele (C_), then it has red fur.\n- Additionally, if it has at least one dominant B allele (B_), then it has brown fur.\n- The overall phenotype combines both traits, so a bird with C_ and B_ would have red-brown fur, while a bird with C_ and bb would have red-checkered, etc.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypic categories are based on the combination of C and B alleles:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red-brown\n2. C_ and bb: red-checkered\n3. cc and B_: checkered-brown\n4. cc and bb: checkered-checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. Because even if a bird has a recessive allele for one gene, if it has a dominant allele for another, it still expresses that dominant trait. So:\n\n- C_ (regardless of B) \u2192 red\n- B_ (regardless of C) \u2192 brown\n- So any bird with at least one dominant allele for either gene will express that trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 red-brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 checkered-brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the 25% frequency for each genotype.\n\nFirst, count how many genotypes fall into each phenotype category:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- CC bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-brown\nWait, no\u2014it's better to use a table.\n\nAlternatively, for each bird:\n\nPhenotype Frequency:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-checkered (25%)\n3. CC bb \u2192 red-checkered (25%)\n4. cc BB \u2192 checkered-brown (25%)\n5. cc Bb \u2192 checkered-brown (25%)\n6. cc bb \u2192 checkered-checkered (25%)\n\nNow, group similar phenotypes:\n\n- red-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- red-checkered: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- checkered-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- checkered-checkered: 25%\n\nWait, no. That can\u2019t be right because all phenotypes add up to 100%, but according to this grouping, red-brown and red-checkered each take 50%, which is impossible because there's overlap. So I must have made a mistake in categorizing.\n\nLet me re-express the correct phenotypic breakdown. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 C and B \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 C and b \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 c and B \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- red-brown: 4/6 \u2192 2/3 \u2248 66.67%\n- red-checkered: 2/6 \u2192 1/3 \u2248 33.33%\n- checkered-brown: 2/6 \u2192 1/3 \u2248 33.33%\n- checkered-checkered: 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%. But looking back, 4 out of 6 are red-brown, 2 out of 6 are red-checkered, 2 out of 6 are checkered-brown, and 1 out of 6 is checkered-checkered. So, the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 4:2:2:1.\n\nBut the options given don't include exact fractions, so I'll convert them to whole numbers:\n\n- red-brown: 4 parts\n- red-checkered: 2 parts\n- checkered-brown: 2 parts\n- checkered-checkered: 1 part\n\nThis totals 9 parts. So the ratio would be 4:2:2:1. To match the answer choices, let's see what the options say.\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no, that doesn't align with my calculation. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, close but not matching exactly.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Closest but not matching.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Not matching.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match my calculated ratio of 4:2:2:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider dominance within the same gene. For example, in the case of B, if a bird has at least one dominant B allele, it shows brown regardless of C. Similarly for C.\n\nLet me approach it differently. Let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the percentage of each genotype.\n\nEach bird has a 25% chance of having each genotype in the F2 generation. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown (25%)\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered (25%)\n- cc BB \u2192 checkered-brown (25%)\n- cc Bb \u2192 checkered-brown (25%)\n- cc bb \u2192 checkered-checkered (25%)\n\nNow, grouping:\n\n- red-brown: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- red-checkered: 25% (CC bb) + 25% (cc BB) \u2192 Wait, no: CC bb is red-checkered (since B is recessive), and cc BB is red-brown (since C is dominant). Wait, no, CC bb is red-checkered because B is recessive, but CC BB is red-brown because B is dominant. Similarly, cc BB is red-brown because B is dominant, and cc Bb is checkered-brown because B is dominant.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me list each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n4. cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n5. cc Bb \u2192 checkered-brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- red-brown: 4 cases (1,2,4)\n- red-checkered: 1 case (3)\n- checkered-brown: 1 case (5)\n- checkered-checkered: 1 case (6)\n\nTotal: 6 cases. So:\n\n- red-brown: 4/6 = 2/3 \u2248 66.67%\n- red-checkered: 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n- checkered-brown: 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n- checkered-checkered: 1/6 \u2248 16.67%\n\nThis still sums to 100%, but the options don't reflect this. Looking at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which resembles a dihybrid cross without the dominance issues. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that the checkered bird is homozygous for both recessive alleles (cc), so it cannot exhibit either coat color. Thus, in the F2 generation, the checkered phenotype would only occur if both parents contribute a recessive allele, leading to the cc genotype. So:\n\n- Only 25% of F2 birds are checkered (cc bb)\n- The rest (75%) are non-checkered, which includes red-brown, red-checkered, and checkered-brown.\n\nIn those 75%, the phenotypes would depend on the presence of dominant alleles. Since the F1 was CcBb, the F2 would have 75% of the F1's possible combinations, excluding the checkered checkered (cc bb).\n\nSo among the 75%:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of F1 \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- CC Bb: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n- CC bb: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n- cc BB: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n- cc Bb: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n- cc bb: 25% of F1 \u2192 18.75%\n\nBut since only the non-checkered ones (excluding cc bb) contribute to the phenotypes:\n\n- Non-checkered F2: 75% of F2 \u2192 56.25% (but wait, total F2 is 100%, so 75% are non-checkered)\n- Within these, the percentages are:\n\nCC BB: 18.75% of F2 \u2192 red-brown (18.75%)\nCC Bb: 18.75% \u2192 red-brown (18.75%)\nCC bb: 18.75% \u2192 red-checkered (18.75%)\ncc BB: 18.75% \u2192 red-brown (18.75%)\ncc Bb: 18.75% \u2192 checkered-brown (18.75%)\n\nNow, summing the red-brown contributions:\n\n18.75 (CC BB) + 18.75 (CC Bb) + 18.75 (cc BB) = 56.25%\n\nRed-checkered: 18.75 (CC bb)\n\nCheckered-brown: 18.75 (cc Bb)\n\nCheckered-checkered: 0 (only cc bb contributes nothing)\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts assuming 100 individuals:\n\n- Checkered-red (red-brown): 56.25% \u2192 56.25\n- Checkered-checkered: 18.75 \u2192 18.75\n- Checkered-brown: 18.75 \u2192 18.75\n- Red-checkered: 18.75 \u2192 18.75\n\nTo make these whole numbers, multiply each by 4 (to eliminate decimals):\n\n- Checkered-red: 56.25 * 4 = 225\n- Checkered-checkered: 18.75 * 4 = 75\n- Checkered-brown: 18.75 * 4 = 75\n- Red-checkered: 18.75 * 4 = 75\n\nNow, looking at the options, none directly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to G are various ratios like 4:2:2:1, but none match 56:18:18:0 when converted to whole numbers. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered bird is represented as 'c' for both alleles, making it 'cc', whereas the red and brown colors come from the presence of dominant alleles. So in terms of dominance:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 red\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n\nThus, any bird with at least one dominant C or dominant B will have a fur color, regardless of the other. So, in F2:\n\n- All except cc bb will have some color.\n- Among these, red-brown (both C and B dominant), red-checkered (C dominant, B recessive), checkered-brown (B dominant, C recessive), and checkered-checkered (both recessive).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each genotype, ignoring dominance beyond the simple presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, the 75% non-checkered F2 (excluding cc bb) would have:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of F2 \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb: 25% of F2 \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb: 25% of F2 \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB: 25% of F2 \u2192 red-brown\n- cc Bb: 25% of F2 \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc bb: 25% of F2 \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nNow, translating these into counts:\n\nAssuming 100 individuals:\n\n- CC BB: 25 \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb: 25 \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb: 25 \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB: 25 \u2192 red-brown\n- cc Bb: 25 \u2192 checkered-brown\n- cc bb: 25 \u2192 checkered-checkered\n\nTotal: 100\n\nNow, grouping:\n\n- red-brown: 25 + 25 + 25 = 75\n- red-checkered: 25\n- checkered-brown: 25\n- checkered-checkered: 25\n\nWhich simplifies to a 75:25:25:25 ratio, or dividing each by 25: 3:1:1:1.\n\nWait, but this isn't matching any of the options either. Let me go back to the initial calculation where I considered each bird's phenotype based on dominance. In that scenario, the phenotypic ratio was 4:2:2:1, corresponding to red-brown, red-checkered, checkered-brown, checkered-checkered. Converting that into counts, it would be 4 parts, 2 parts, 2 parts, 1 part. Adding up to 9 parts, so each part is 100 / 9 \u2248 11.11. Thus:\n\n- red-brown: ~44.44\n- red-checkered: ~22.22\n- checkered-brown: ~22.22\n- checkered-checkered: ~11.11\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the options. \n\nWait, looking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems like a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is typical for a dihybrid cross without considering dominance. But our calculations showed a different ratio due to dominance. \n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that the checkered bird is not expressing any color, thus only showing the other two traits. So in that case",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene assort independently.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene assort independently. So for each gene, there's a 25% chance of each combination. However, the actual F2 phenotypes depend on the dominance of the alleles.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically for the F2 phenotypic ratio. The F2 will have four phenotypes depending on the genotypes and how they express the traits. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- Cc (heterozygous for pigment) \u2192 dominant B (heterozygous for color) \u2192 Phenotype depends on whether B is present or not.\n  - If both C and B are present, then the bird is checkered (since C is dominant and B is dominant).\n  - If only C is present, it's plain red (C is dominant, but B is absent).\n  - Similarly, if only B is present, it's brown (B is dominant, C is absent).\n  - Only both C and B missing \u2192 plain brown?\nWait, no, checking the given options. The options mention \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", and \"plain brown\". So:\n\n- Checkered: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 phenotype is checkered red (or plain red?), but the options say checkered red and checkered brown. Hmm, but according to standard, C and B being dominant would make it checkered. So:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): checkered red (if B is brown)\n- C (dominant) and b (recessive): checkered plain red\n- c (recessive) and B (dominant): plain brown (because C is absent)\n- c (recessive) and b (recessive): plain brown (both recessive)\n\nBut looking at the options, some seem to group them differently. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nThe options list checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B dominant\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, b (so B is recessive)\n- Plain red: c and B dominant (i.e., C recessive, B dominant)\n- Plain brown: both C and B recessive\n\nSo, now, for the F2, we'll look at the possible genotypes and assign phenotypes accordingly.\n\nFrom the F1 cross (CcBb x CcBb), the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with a certain probability:\n\n- CC (probability 25%): which is dominant C, so regardless of B, it's red.\n  - If B is dominant (B), it's checkered red.\n  - If B is recessive (b), it's checkered plain red.\n- Cc (probability 50%):\n  - If B is dominant (B), it's checkered brown.\n  - If B is recessive (b), it's plain brown.\n- cc (probability 25%):\n  - If B is dominant (B), it's plain red (since C is recessive).\n  - If B is recessive (b), it's plain brown (since both C and B are recessive).\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (since each gene segregates independently into 4 combinations, multiplied together).\n\nLet's compute the number for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (CR)**:\n   - Occurs when genotype is CC and B is dominant (B).\n   - Probability for CC: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 50%\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 out of 16\n\n2. **Checkered Plain Red (CPR)**:\n   - Occurs when genotype is CC and B is recessive (b).\n   - Probability for CC: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 50% (but since B is recessive, it's b)\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 out of 16\n\n3. **Plain Red (PR)**:\n   - Occurs when genotype is cc and B is dominant (B).\n   - Probability for cc: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 50%\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 out of 16\n\n4. **Plain Brown (PB)**:\n   - Occurs in three cases:\n     a. Genotype is Cc and B is dominant (B).\n     b. Genotype is Cc and B is recessive (b).\n     c. Genotype is cc and B is recessive (b).\n   \n   Let's calculate each case:\n\n   - **a. Cc and B dominant**:\n     - Probability for Cc: 50%\n     - Probability for B dominant: 50%\n     - Combined probability: 50% * 50% = 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n   \n   - **b. Cc and B recessive**:\n     - Probability for Cc: 50%\n     - Probability for B recessive: 50%\n     - Combined probability: 50% * 50% = 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n   \n   - **c. cc and B recessive**:\n     - Probability for cc: 25%\n     - Probability for B recessive: 50%\n     - Combined probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 out of 16\n\nAdding up the probabilities for PB: 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 out of 16.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nTotal for CR: 2/16\nCPR: 2/16\nPR: 2/16\nPB: 4+4+2=10/16\n\nTotal: 2+2+2+10=16, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): 2\n- Checkered Plain Red (CPR): 2\n- Plain Red (PR): 2\n- Plain Brown (PB): 10\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match what I calculated.\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Also not matching.\n\nOption J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, closest is option J.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So for each gene, C and B, we can model the segregation.\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n\n- CC (dominant C): 75%\n- Cc (dominant C): 25%\n\nFor the color (B):\n\n- BB (dominant B): 25%\n- Bb (dominant B): 50%\n- bb (recessive B): 25%\n\nSo the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\nFor each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC BB: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: (3/4)*(1/2)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered Plain Red\n- CC bb: same as above\nWait, no, perhaps better to think in terms of each gene separately.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for both genes.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to note that each gene is segregating independently, so the F2 phenotypic ratio can be determined by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nHowever, the key point is that for each bird, the presence of dominant alleles C and B leads to different phenotypes.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation would be:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): 9/16\n- Checkered Brown (CB): 3/16\n- Checkered Plain Red (CP): 3/16\n- Plain Brown (PB): 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, but the counts don't align with our calculation.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All the same, which seems unlikely unless all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. So:\n\n- For CR: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- For CB: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- For CP: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- For PB: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking at the options, option H is Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Looking back:\n\nOptions are labeled A to J, each giving specific numbers for the four phenotypes.\n\nMy conclusion was that the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly reflect that.\n\nWait, let me check option H again:\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nThat adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, but the distribution doesn't match 9:3:3:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me consider another approach: the F2 generation comes from the dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the squares resulting from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is from F1 selfing. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nAnd for each genotype, the phenotypes depend on both C and B.\n\nNow, considering the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered Red (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Checkered Plain Red (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain Brown (both C and B recessive)\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\n- CR: 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- CB: 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- CP: 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- PB: 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n\nWhich sums to 25%, but in reality, it's 16 parts. So scaling up, it becomes 16 parts:\n\n- CR: 2 parts (since 6.25% * 16 = 10, but that complicates things. Perhaps better to use fractions.)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but weighted based on the dominance.\n\nWait, no. Because in reality, the 16 parts would be divided as follows:\n\nEach of the four categories (CR, CB, CP, PB) corresponds to a proportion of 1/4, but within those, further subdivision occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer to see that:\n\nIn F2, each of the four genotypes (CC, Cc, cc) occurs at a 1:2:1 ratio. Then, for each, the phenotype depends on both C and B.\n\nSo:\n\n- For CC (25% of F2), the phenotype is CR (since both C and B dominant).\n- For Cc (50%), the phenotype is either CB or CP, each 25% within Cc.\n- For cc (25%), the phenotype is either CP or PB, each 25%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- CR: 25% of F2 \u2192 4/16\n- CB: 25% of F2 \u2192 4/16\n- CP: 25% of F2 \u2192 4/16\n- PB: 25% of F2 \u2192 4/16\n\nWait, that adds up to 16 parts, where each part is 1 unit. So:\n\nCR: 4 units\nCB: 4 units\nCP: 4 units\nPB: 4 units\n\nSo the ratio is 4:4:4:4, or 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me review the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options provided were:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nNone of these options perfectly matches 1:1:1:1. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 phenotypic ratio is incorrect. Let me consider the actual F2 ratios without assuming all four phenotypes are equally probable.\n\nWait, no, because the presence of both dominant alleles C and B results in different phenotypes. So, the correct ratio should take into account the dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option H being scaled down. But option H states 5,3,2,6, which totals 16 but doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me do it more carefully.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 phenotypes can be modeled as:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B.\n\nSince both C and B are dominant, the bird will be:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): Both C and B dominant \u2192 (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered Brown (CB): C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered Plain Red (CP): C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Brown (PB): Both C and B recessive \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly, but option H is 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16. This suggests that perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the F2 ratio is not simply 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation includes the F1, whose gametes are CB and cb, leading to a different F2. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing, which is indeed the same as the previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 is from a dihybrid cross between two F1 birds.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene assort independently. So for each gene, there's a 25% chance of each combination. However, the actual F2 phenotypes depend on the dominance of the alleles.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically for the F2 phenotypic ratio. The F2 will have four phenotypes depending on the genotypes and how they express the traits. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- Cc (heterozygous for pigment) \u2192 dominant B (heterozygous for color) \u2192 Phenotype depends on whether B is present or not.\n  - If both C and B are present, then the bird is checkered (since C is dominant and B is dominant).\n  - If only C is present, it's plain red (C is dominant, but B is absent).\n  - Similarly, if only B is present, it's brown (B is dominant, C is absent).\n  - Only both C and B missing \u2192 plain brown?\nWait, no, checking the given options. The options mention \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", and \"plain brown\". So:\n\n- Checkered: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 phenotype is checkered red (or plain red?), but the options say checkered red and checkered brown. Hmm, but according to standard, C and B being dominant would make it checkered. So:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): checkered red (if B is brown)\n- C (dominant) and b (recessive): checkered plain red\n- c (recessive) and B (dominant): plain brown (because C is absent)\n- c (recessive) and b (recessive): plain brown (both recessive)\n\nBut looking at the options, some seem to group them differently. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nThe options list checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B dominant\n- Checkered brown: C dominant, b (so B is recessive)\n- Plain red: c and B dominant (i.e., C recessive, B dominant)\n- Plain brown: both C and B recessive\n\nSo, now, for the F2, we'll look at the possible genotypes and assign phenotypes accordingly.\n\nFrom the F1 cross (CcBb x CcBb), the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with a certain probability:\n\n- CC (probability 25%): which is dominant C, so regardless of B, it's red.\n  - If B is dominant (B), it's checkered red.\n  - If B is recessive (b), it's checkered plain red.\n- Cc (probability 50%):\n  - If B is dominant (B), it's checkered brown.\n  - If B is recessive (b), it's plain brown.\n- cc (probability 25%):\n  - If B is dominant (B), it's plain red (since C is recessive).\n  - If B is recessive (b), it's plain brown (since both C and B are recessive).\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (since each gene segregates independently into 4 combinations, multiplied together).\n\nLet's compute the number for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (CR)**:\n   - Occurs when genotype is CC and B is dominant (B).\n   - Probability for CC: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 50%\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 out of 16\n\n2. **Checkered Plain Red (CPR)**:\n   - Occurs when genotype is CC and B is recessive (b).\n   - Probability for CC: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 50% (but since B is recessive, it's b)\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 out of 16\n\n3. **Plain Red (PR)**:\n   - Occurs when genotype is cc and B is dominant (B).\n   - Probability for cc: 25%\n   - Probability for B: 50%\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 out of 16\n\n4. **Plain Brown (PB)**:\n   - Occurs in three cases:\n     a. Genotype is Cc and B is dominant (B).\n     b. Genotype is Cc and B is recessive (b).\n     c. Genotype is cc and B is recessive (b).\n   \n   Let's calculate each case:\n\n   - **a. Cc and B dominant**:\n     - Probability for Cc: 50%\n     - Probability for B dominant: 50%\n     - Combined probability: 50% * 50% = 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n   \n   - **b. Cc and B recessive**:\n     - Probability for Cc: 50%\n     - Probability for B recessive: 50%\n     - Combined probability: 50% * 50% = 25% \u2192 4 out of 16\n   \n   - **c. cc and B recessive**:\n     - Probability for cc: 25%\n     - Probability for B recessive: 50%\n     - Combined probability: 25% * 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2 out of 16\n\nAdding up the probabilities for PB: 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 out of 16.\n\nWait, but let me double-check:\n\nTotal for CR: 2/16\nCPR: 2/16\nPR: 2/16\nPB: 4+4+2=10/16\n\nTotal: 2+2+2+10=16, which checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): 2\n- Checkered Plain Red (CPR): 2\n- Plain Red (PR): 2\n- Plain Brown (PB): 10\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match what I calculated.\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Also not matching.\n\nOption J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, closest is option J.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So for each gene, C and B, we can model the segregation.\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n\n- CC (dominant C): 75%\n- Cc (dominant C): 25%\n\nFor the color (B):\n\n- BB (dominant B): 25%\n- Bb (dominant B): 50%\n- bb (recessive B): 25%\n\nSo the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\nFor each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC BB: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: (3/4)*(1/2)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- CC bb: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered Plain Red\n- CC bb: same as above\nWait, no, perhaps better to think in terms of each gene separately.\n\nAlternatively, using a Punnett square for both genes.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to note that each gene is segregating independently, so the F2 phenotypic ratio can be determined by multiplying the probabilities for each trait.\n\nHowever, the key point is that for each bird, the presence of dominant alleles C and B leads to different phenotypes.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation would be:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): 9/16\n- Checkered Brown (CB): 3/16\n- Checkered Plain Red (CP): 3/16\n- Plain Brown (PB): 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16, but the counts don't align with our calculation.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All the same, which seems unlikely unless all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match my calculation. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both C and B. So:\n\n- For CR: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- For CB: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- For CP: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- For PB: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking at the options, option H is Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Looking back:\n\nOptions are labeled A to J, each giving specific numbers for the four phenotypes.\n\nMy conclusion was that the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options directly reflect that.\n\nWait, let me check option H again:\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nThat adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, but the distribution doesn't match 9:3:3:1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me consider another approach: the F2 generation comes from the dihybrid cross between CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the squares resulting from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is from F1 selfing. Thus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nAnd for each genotype, the phenotypes depend on both C and B.\n\nNow, considering the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered Red (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Cc (50%) \u2192 Checkered Brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 Checkered Plain Red (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. cc (25%) \u2192 Plain Brown (both C and B recessive)\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\n- CR: 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- CB: 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- CP: 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- PB: 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n\nWhich sums to 25%, but in reality, it's 16 parts. So scaling up, it becomes 16 parts:\n\n- CR: 2 parts (since 6.25% * 16 = 10, but that complicates things. Perhaps better to use fractions.)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but weighted based on the dominance.\n\nWait, no. Because in reality, the 16 parts would be divided as follows:\n\nEach of the four categories (CR, CB, CP, PB) corresponds to a proportion of 1/4, but within those, further subdivision occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer to see that:\n\nIn F2, each of the four genotypes (CC, Cc, cc) occurs at a 1:2:1 ratio. Then, for each, the phenotype depends on both C and B.\n\nSo:\n\n- For CC (25% of F2), the phenotype is CR (since both C and B dominant).\n- For Cc (50%), the phenotype is either CB or CP, each 25% within Cc.\n- For cc (25%), the phenotype is either CP or PB, each 25%.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- CR: 25% of F2 \u2192 4/16\n- CB: 25% of F2 \u2192 4/16\n- CP: 25% of F2 \u2192 4/16\n- PB: 25% of F2 \u2192 4/16\n\nWait, that adds up to 16 parts, where each part is 1 unit. So:\n\nCR: 4 units\nCB: 4 units\nCP: 4 units\nPB: 4 units\n\nSo the ratio is 4:4:4:4, or 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Let me review the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options provided were:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nNone of these options perfectly matches 1:1:1:1. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption about the F2 phenotypic ratio is incorrect. Let me consider the actual F2 ratios without assuming all four phenotypes are equally probable.\n\nWait, no, because the presence of both dominant alleles C and B results in different phenotypes. So, the correct ratio should take into account the dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option H being scaled down. But option H states 5,3,2,6, which totals 16 but doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me do it more carefully.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 phenotypes can be modeled as:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of each phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B.\n\nSince both C and B are dominant, the bird will be:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): Both C and B dominant \u2192 (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered Brown (CB): C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered Plain Red (CP): C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain Brown (PB): Both C and B recessive \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly, but option H is 5,3,2,6, which adds to 16. This suggests that perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the F2 ratio is not simply 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation includes the F1, whose gametes are CB and cb, leading to a different F2. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing, which is indeed the same as the previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 is from a dihybrid cross between two F1 birds. Let's assume that instead of CC BB and cc bb, the parents are F1 birds, which are CcBb and CcBb. Then, the F2 would be from their selfing.\n\nIn that case, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- 50% Cc (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n- 25% cc (from cc \u00d7 cc)\n\nThen, for each genotype, the phenotype would be determined by the dominance of C and B.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would still be 9:3:3:1, but applied to the F2 generation from F1 selfing.\n\nWait, but none of the options match 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, going back, the question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So C is dominant (checkered), and c is recessive (plain).

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

The parents are CC BB (which is a dominant combination) and cc bb (a recessive combination). So the cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, now I realize that CC BB is a dominant allele combination for both genes, while cc bb is a recessive combination. So the cross involves a dominant-recessive combination, leading to all offspring being heterozygous for both traits. So the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would follow the dihybrid rule. The dihybrid cross formula says that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where 9 is the homozygous dominant for both traits, 3 is the heterozygous dominant for both, etc., depending on dominance. But in our case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which means the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be based on the dihybrid cross of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. However, the user seems to present a more detailed Punnett square approach, which might include F1 and F2 generations beyond the question's scope, so perhaps I should focus on the F2.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the F2 generation, and the options suggest various phenotypic ratios. Let me consider the possible phenotypes. The two traits are:\n\n1. Pigment color:\n   - C (dominant): red (checkered)\n   - c (recessive): plain (checkered)\n\n2. Color:\n   - B (dominant): brown (checkered)\n   - b (recessive): red (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both alleles. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele. So any bird with either C or B will be red (checkered), and any bird with c or b will be plain (checkered). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Wait, the dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. So the presence of C or B makes the bird red, and c or b makes it plain. So regardless of which trait is dominant, if there's at least one dominant allele, the bird is red; otherwise, it's plain. Wait, but in reality, the dominance refers to the combination of alleles. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C or c), it's red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for color (B or b), it's brown. Wait, that doesn't make sense because both C and B are dominant. Maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify: \n\nIn genetics, the dominance relationships determine whether a particular trait is expressed even without the presence of another dominant allele. For example, in coat color, if the presence of at least one dominant allele results in a certain color, and the other dominant allele may override it if the other is recessive. In this case, for pigment color (C and c):\n\n- If a bird has at least one C allele, it is red (dominant).\n- If it has at least one c, it is plain (recessive).\n\nSimilarly, for color (B and b):\n\n- At least one B \u2192 brown.\n- At least one b \u2192 red.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting because having at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for color would mean the bird is red. Because both conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance applies per trait independently. So the pigment color (C vs. c) is one trait, and color (B vs. b) is another. So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either trait.\n\nWait, but that complicates things because the same bird could have both dominant alleles for pigment and color. So the phenotype would still be red (since both are dominant), regardless of color. So the phenotype classification would be:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C or c) AND at least one dominant allele for color (B or b), it's red (checkered).\n- Otherwise, it's plain (checkered).\n\nWait, that can't be right because if a bird has C (pigment dominant) and B (color dominant), it's red. But what if a bird has c (pigment recessive) and B (color dominant)? Then it's still red because it has a dominant color allele. Similarly, if it has c (pigment recessive) and b (color recessive), it's plain. So the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele in either pigment or color.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (phenotype): birds with at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or c) AND at least one dominant allele in color (B or b).\n\n2. Plain red (phenotype): birds with at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or c) BUT no dominant allele in color (b). Wait, no\u2014if the bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment but none in color, it's still red because pigment is dominant. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in pigment (C) OR at least one dominant allele in color (B). Because both C and B are dominant, if a bird has either C or B, it's red. If it has neither, it's plain. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (if has at least one dominant in pigment or color)\n- Plain red (if has neither dominant in pigment nor color)\n- Checkered brown (if has dominant in pigment but not color)\n- Plain brown (if has neither dominant in pigment nor color)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because the phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant alleles. Let me list all possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (C/c):\n\n- CC \u2192 red (pigment dominant)\n- Cc \u2192 red (pigment dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain (pigment recessive)\n\nPossible genotypes for color (B/b):\n\n- BB \u2192 brown (color dominant)\n- Bb \u2192 brown (color dominant)\n- bb \u2192 plain (color recessive)\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment OR at least one dominant allele in color. Since both C and B are dominant, any bird with at least one C or B will be red (checkered), and any bird with neither C nor B will be plain (checkered). Wait, but that can't be because if a bird has C (pigment dominant) and B (color dominant), it's red. If it has C (pigment dominant) but not B (color), it's still red. Similarly, if it has c (pigment recessive) but B (color dominant), it's still red. Only when it has neither C nor B does it become plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: has at least one dominant allele in pigment OR color (i.e., has C/B)\n2. Plain red: has neither dominant allele in pigment nor color (i.e., has cc and bb)\n3. Checkered brown: has dominant pigment but no dominant color (i.e., has C but not B)\n4. Plain brown: has neither dominant pigment nor color (i.e., has cc and bb)\n\nWait, but according to the initial description, red is determined by C and brown by B. So, if a bird has at least one C or B, it's red; else, plain. That matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. The F2 comes from a dihybrid cross of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nUsing the dihybrid formula, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to:\n\n- 9: Phenotype with at least one C and one B (red)\n- 3: Phenotype with C and not B (red)\n- 3: Phenotype with c and B (red)\n- 1: Phenotype with c and c (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to categorize into the four phenotypes based on the presence of C and B.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Checkered red: (at least one C) AND (at least one B) \u2192 9/16 of the population\n2. Checkered brown: (has C) AND (no B) \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain red: (no C) AND (has B) \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain brown: (no C) AND (no B) \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014because the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So the total for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Both C and B: 9/16 (Checkered red)\n- C and not B: 3/16 (Checkered brown)\n- Not C and B: 3/16 (Plain red)\n- Neither C nor B: 1/16 (Plain brown)\n\nBut looking back at the options given, let me see which one matches this distribution.\n\nLooking at option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is correct. But according to my calculation, Checkered red is 9, Checkered brown is 3, Plain red is 3, and Plain brown is 1. But none of the options match exactly except for option E, which says Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. That would add up to 16 as well, but it's reversed. So perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes.\n\nWait, hold on. The user presented a table showing F2 phenotypic ratio as 6, 2, 6, 2 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively, which sums to 16. But according to my analysis, it should be 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the user provided a table in point F2 with:\n\n- Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2.\n\nThat totals 16, and the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. That suggests that the phenotypes are grouped differently, perhaps based on some other criteria, like the dominance order rather than the actual presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, that changes everything. Let me read the original question again carefully.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment color.\n- b is recessive for pigment.\n- B is dominant for color.\n- b is recessive for color.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in either pigment or color.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: has C or B (or both) \u2192 9/16\n2. Checkered brown: has C but not B \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain red: has B but not C \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain brown: has neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n\nBut in the user's answer choices, the F2 phenotypic ratio is presented as 6:2:6:2, which corresponds to 3:1:3:1. This implies that the phenotypes are being grouped based on some priority, perhaps in terms of the order of dominance. For example, maybe the bird is classified as red if it has at least one dominant allele in pigment, regardless of color, and similarly as brown if it has at least one dominant allele in color, regardless of pigment. But that contradicts the previous understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant to group the phenotypes based on the order of dominance: first checking pigment (C) over color (B). So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant pigment allele (C), it's considered red, irrespective of color.\n- If it doesn't have a dominant pigment allele but has at least one dominant color allele (B), it's considered brown.\n- If it has neither, it's plain.\n\nThis grouping would change the counts. Let's recalculate under this assumption:\n\nPhenotype groups:\n\n1. Checkered red: has C (pigment dominant) \u2192 9/16\n2. Checkered brown: has B (color dominant) but not C \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain brown: has neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n4. Plain red: has C but also B \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014this doesn't align with the user's answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the phenotypes in the order of checking pigment first, then color, ignoring dominance. So, any bird with C is red, any bird with B is brown, regardless of the other. But that would mean:\n\n- All birds with C are red (9/16)\n- All birds with B but not C are brown (3/16)\n- All others are plain (1/16)\n\nWhich would result in a ratio of 9:3:1, but the user's answer options don't match this. Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the order, thinking that color is checked first. Let me try that.\n\nIf the order is color first, then pigment:\n\n1. Plain brown: has B \u2192 3/16\n2. Checkered brown: has B but not C \u2192 3/16\n3. Checkered red: has C but not B \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain red: has neither \u2192 1/16\n\nAgain, this doesn't fit the user's options. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the presence of at least one dominant allele in pigment or color, but in a specific order, such as checking pigment first, then color. In that case:\n\n- All birds with C are red (9/16)\n- Among those with C, those with B are brown (3/16)\n- Those with C and not B remain red (3/16)\n- Those with neither are plain (1/16)\n\nThus, the ratio becomes 9:3:1. But the user's options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the user's answer choices were based on a different approach, such as counting the number of dominant alleles.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user is considering the dominance order within each trait separately. For instance, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, and for color, B is dominant over b. So the phenotype is determined by whether each trait is present. Thus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 red (checkered)\n2. C and not B \u2192 red (checkered)\n3. not C and B \u2192 brown (checkered)\n4. neither \u2192 plain (checkered)\n\nWhich again brings us back to 9:3:3:1. However, the user's options don't match this directly. Looking back at the options, option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16 and suggests a ratio of 3:1:3:1. This could imply that the phenotypes are categorized based on the order of checking pigment first, then color, resulting in:\n\n1. All C \u2192 red (6)\n2. C and not B \u2192 red (2)\n3. B and not C \u2192 brown (6)\n4. Neither \u2192 plain (2)\n\nThis grouping seems to align with the user's answer choice A. However, this contradicts the standard genetic interpretation because typically, both traits are considered together unless specified otherwise.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the user intended to group the phenotypes based on the order of checking, leading to the ratio 6:2:6:2. Therefore, the correct answer would be option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the segregation would lead to different ratios. Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to use the standard dihybrid cross formula. The parents are CC BB (which is a dominant combination) and cc bb (a recessive combination). So the cross is between CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, now I realize that CC BB is a dominant allele combination for both genes, while cc bb is a recessive combination. So the cross involves a dominant-recessive combination, leading to all offspring being heterozygous for both traits. So the F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would follow the dihybrid rule. The dihybrid cross formula says that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where 9 is the homozygous dominant for both traits, 3 is the heterozygous dominant for both, etc., depending on dominance. But in our case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which means the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be based on the dihybrid cross of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. However, the user seems to present a more detailed Punnett square approach, which might include F1 and F2 generations beyond the question's scope, so perhaps I should focus on the F2.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the F2 generation, and the options suggest various phenotypic ratios. Let me consider the possible phenotypes. The two traits are:\n\n1. Pigment color:\n   - C (dominant): red (checkered)\n   - c (recessive): plain (checkered)\n\n2. Color:\n   - B (dominant): brown (checkered)\n   - b (recessive): red (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both alleles. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele. So any bird with either C or B will be red (checkered), and any bird with c or b will be plain (checkered). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Wait, the dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. So the presence of C or B makes the bird red, and c or b makes it plain. So regardless of which trait is dominant, if there's at least one dominant allele, the bird is red; otherwise, it's plain. Wait, but in reality, the dominance refers to the combination of alleles.

Similarly, if it has c (pigment recessive) and b (color recessive), it's plain. So the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele in either pigment or color.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (phenotype): birds with at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or c) AND at least one dominant allele in color (B or b).\n\n2. Plain red (phenotype): birds with at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or c) BUT no dominant allele in color (b). Wait, no\u2014if the bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment but none in color, it's still red because pigment is dominant. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in pigment (C) OR at least one dominant allele in color (B).

Because the phenotype is determined by the combination of dominant alleles. Let me list all possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (C/c):\n\n- CC \u2192 red (pigment dominant)\n- Cc \u2192 red (pigment dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain (pigment recessive)\n\nPossible genotypes for color (B/b):\n\n- BB \u2192 brown (color dominant)\n- Bb \u2192 brown (color dominant)\n- bb \u2192 plain (color recessive)\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment OR at least one dominant allele in color. Since both C and B are dominant, any bird with at least one C or B will be red (checkered), and any bird with neither C nor B will be plain (checkered). Wait, but that can't be because if a bird has C (pigment dominant) and B (color dominant), it's red. If it has C (pigment dominant) but not B (color), it's still red. Similarly, if it has c (pigment recessive) but B (color dominant), it's still red. Only when it has neither C nor B does it become plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: has at least one dominant allele in pigment OR color (i.e., has C/B)\n2. Plain red: has neither dominant allele in pigment nor color (i.e., has cc and bb)\n3. Checkered brown: has dominant pigment but no dominant color (i.e., has C but not B)\n4. Plain brown: has neither dominant pigment nor color (i.e., has cc and bb)\n\nWait, but according to the initial description, red is determined by C and brown by B.

Checkered red: (at least one C) AND (at least one B) \u2192 9/16 of the population\n2. Checkered brown: (has C) AND (no B) \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain red: (no C) AND (has B) \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain brown: (no C) AND (no B) \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014because the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So the total for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Both C and B: 9/16 (Checkered red)\n- C and not B: 3/16 (Checkered brown)\n- Not C and B: 3/16 (Plain red)\n- Neither C nor B: 1/16 (Plain brown)\n\nBut looking back at the options given, let me see which one matches this distribution.\n\nLooking at option D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is correct. But according to my calculation, Checkered red is 9, Checkered brown is 3, Plain red is 3, and Plain brown is 1. But none of the options match exactly except for option E, which says Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. That would add up to 16 as well, but it's reversed. So perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes.\n\nWait, hold on. The user presented a table showing F2 phenotypic ratio as 6, 2, 6, 2 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively, which sums to 16. But according to my analysis, it should be 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the user provided a table in point F2 with:\n\n- Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2.\n\nThat totals 16, and the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. That suggests that the phenotypes are grouped differently, perhaps based on some other criteria, like the dominance order rather than the actual presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, that changes everything. Let me read the original question again carefully.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment color.\n- b is recessive for pigment.\n- B is dominant for color.\n- b is recessive for color.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in either pigment or color.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: has C or B (or both) \u2192 9/16\n2. Checkered brown: has C but not B \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain red: has B but not C \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain brown: has neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n\nBut in the user's answer choices, the F2 phenotypic ratio is presented as 6:2:6:2, which corresponds to 3:1:3:1. This implies that the phenotypes are being grouped based on some priority, perhaps in terms of the order of dominance. For example, maybe the bird is classified as red if it has at least one dominant allele in pigment, regardless of color, and similarly as brown if it has at least one dominant allele in color, regardless of pigment. But that contradicts the previous understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant to group the phenotypes based on the order of dominance: first checking pigment (C) over color (B). So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant pigment allele (C), it's considered red, irrespective of color.\n- If it doesn't have a dominant pigment allele but has at least one dominant color allele (B), it's considered brown.\n- If it has neither, it's plain.\n\nThis grouping would change the counts. Let's recalculate under this assumption:\n\nPhenotype groups:\n\n1. Checkered red: has C (pigment dominant) \u2192 9/16\n2. Checkered brown: has B (color dominant) but not C \u2192 3/16\n3. Plain brown: has neither C nor B \u2192 1/16\n4. Plain red: has C but also B \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014this doesn't align with the user's answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the phenotypes in the order of checking pigment first, then color, ignoring dominance. So, any bird with C is red, any bird with B is brown, regardless of the other. But that would mean:\n\n- All birds with C are red (9/16)\n- All birds with B but not C are brown (3/16)\n- All others are plain (1/16)\n\nWhich would result in a ratio of 9:3:1, but the user's answer options don't match this. Alternatively, perhaps the user confused the order, thinking that color is checked first. Let me try that.\n\nIf the order is color first, then pigment:\n\n1. Plain brown: has B \u2192 3/16\n2. Checkered brown: has B but not C \u2192 3/16\n3. Checkered red: has C but not B \u2192 3/16\n4. Plain red: has neither \u2192 1/16\n\nAgain, this doesn't fit the user's options. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the presence of at least one dominant allele in pigment or color, but in a specific order, such as checking pigment first, then color. In that case:\n\n- All birds with C are red (9/16)\n- Among those with C, those with B are brown (3/16)\n- Those with C and not B remain red (3/16)\n- Those with neither are plain (1/16)\n\nThus, the ratio becomes 9:3:1. But the user's options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the user's answer choices were based on a different approach, such as counting the number of dominant alleles.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user is considering the dominance order within each trait separately. For instance, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, and for color, B is dominant over b. So the phenotype is determined by whether each trait is present. Thus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 red (checkered)\n2. C and not B \u2192 red (checkered)\n3. not C and B \u2192 brown (checkered)\n4. neither \u2192 plain (checkered)\n\nWhich again brings us back to 9:3:3:1. However, the user's options don't match this directly. Looking back at the options, option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16 and suggests a ratio of 3:1:3:1. This could imply that the phenotypes are categorized based on the order of checking pigment first, then color, resulting in:\n\n1. All C \u2192 red (6)\n2. C and not B \u2192 red (2)\n3. B and not C \u2192 brown (6)\n4. Neither \u2192 plain (2)\n\nThis grouping seems to align with the user's answer choice A. However, this contradicts the standard genetic interpretation because typically, both traits are considered together unless specified otherwise.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the user intended to group the phenotypes based on the order of checking, leading to the ratio 6:2:6:2. Therefore, the correct answer would be option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

But given the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each occurring with 25% probability.\n\nNow, the next part is determining the phenotypes. The phenotype depends on both genes. The dominance hierarchy is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So:\n\n- For pigment color (gene C):\n  - C_ (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - cc \u2192 plain\n\n- For animal color (gene B):\n  - B_ (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene. Let's look at each possible genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**:\n   - Pigment color: C_ \u2192 red\n   - Animal color: B_ \u2192 brown\n   - Phenotype: Checkered red\n\n2. **CC Bb**:\n   - Pigment color: red\n   - Animal color: B_ \u2192 brown\n   - Phenotype: Checkered brown\n\n3. **CC bb**:\n   - Pigment color: red\n   - Animal color: bb \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Plain red\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that doesn't make sense. If the animal is brown due to B_, then regardless of pigment, it's brown. Similarly, if it's checkered, regardless of pigment, it's checkered. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Both genes are dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. **CC Bb**: Pigment dominant, animal color dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. **CC bb**: Pigment dominant, animal color recessive \u2192 Plain red\n4. **Cc BB**: Pigment dominant, animal color dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. **Cc Bb**: Pigment dominant, animal color dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. **Cc bb**: Pigment dominant, animal color recessive \u2192 Plain red\n7. **cc BB**: Pigment recessive, animal color dominant \u2192 Plain red\n8. **cc Bb**: Pigment recessive, animal color dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n9. **cc bb**: Pigment recessive, animal color recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, that's nine possible phenotypes, which seems too many. Alternatively, perhaps we can categorize them into three categories: Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown. Let's see:\n\nFrom the above list:\n\n- **Checkered red**: CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered brown**: CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\n- **Plain red**: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 birds\n- **Plain brown**: cc bb, cc Bb \u2192 Wait, no. From the list above, cc Bb is plain brown, and cc bb is plain brown. So that's 2 birds.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 4 phenotypes, but according to this breakdown, there are four categories, each with multiple individuals. So now, the total number of birds in F2 is 16 (since each F1 produces 4 gametes, leading to 4\u00d74=16 F2 individuals).\n\nLet me recount:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1 bird (CC BB)\n- **Checkered brown**: 3 birds (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- **Plain red**: 3 birds (CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\n- **Plain brown**: 2 birds (cc bb, cc Bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014because from the F2 list, cc Bb is plain brown, and cc bb is plain brown. So that's 2 birds. Similarly, CC bb is plain red, and the others are either checkered or plain. So yes, four phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

    "rollout": " However, since each parent contributes only one allele for each gene, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor Gene C: \n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut since the parents are homozygous, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor C:\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor B:\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would have a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene, but considering both genes together, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n[Parent 1 gametes] x [Parent 2 gametes]\n\nEach cell represents a combination. For example, if Parent 1 gametes are CB and Parent 2 are cb, then the F2 would be CcBb and ccbb. Similarly, CB gametes with cb make CcBb, and cb gametes with cb make ccbb.\n\nWait, but I might have confused the setup. Let me approach it differently. The F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\nGene C:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nGene B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are combinations of these. To get the phenotypes, I need to determine how these genotypes translate into animals. The dominance hierarchy is such that:\n\n- For C: C (red) > c (plain)\n- For B: B (brown) > b (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both alleles. The order matters because both genes are working together. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n10. c c bb \u2192 Checkered red?\n\nWait, no. Actually, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. If either gene is present, the color is determined by the dominant allele. So:\n\n- If C is present (either C or Cc), and B is present (either B or Bb), then the animal is checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is not (e.g., Cc bb), then the animal is checkered brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (c c bb), then the animal is plain red.\n- If B is present but C is not (e.g., cc BB), then the animal is plain brown.\n\nLet me verify that logic. Suppose the animal has at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B. Then it's checkered red. Otherwise, if it has C but not B, it's checkered brown. If it has neither C nor B, it's plain red. If it has B but not C, it's plain brown.\n\nNow, applying this to each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Only B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Only B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Only B present \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain red\n10. c c bb \u2192 Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but there are 10 possible F2 genotypes, but the actual number of unique phenotypes isn't 10 because some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. Let me count:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red: Cases 7, 9, 10 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain brown: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal cases: 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 9. Hmm, that doesn't add up because F2 should have 16 individuals if considering all possible gametes. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation would have 16 individuals, but some may have identical phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the 16 possible F2 outcomes:\n\nLooking back, the 16 combinations would include all possible pairs from the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). But earlier, I thought of 10 because I considered only the gametes. Alternatively, each parent contributes two alleles, so the F2 would have 16 possible genotypes, each producing one individual. Among these, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better way is to calculate the number of each phenotype directly without enumerating all 16 possibilities. Using the rules above:\n\nNumber of Checkered red (C+ B present):\n\nIn terms of counts, for each gene, the probability of having C is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 3/4 have C). Similarly for B, 3/4 have B. Assuming independent assortment, the probability of having at least one C and at least one B is (3/4)(3/4) - (probability of neither) = (9/16) - (1/16) = 8/16 = 1/2. So half the F2 would be Checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown occurs when C is present but B is absent. Probability of C is 3/4, B absent is 1/4 \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. So 3/16 of F2 are Checkered brown.\n\nPlain red occurs when neither C nor B is present. Probability of neither is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So 1/16 of F2 are Plain red.\n\nPlain brown occurs when B is present but C is absent. Probability of B is 3/4, C absent is 1/4 \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. So 3/16 of F2 are Plain brown.\n\nAdding them up: 8/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 = 17/16, which exceeds 1. That indicates a mistake in calculation. Clearly, something is wrong with my probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Instead of thinking in probabilities, let me consider the actual number of each genotype among the F2 population.\n\nThe F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. The F1 is CcBb, so it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can only give one allele, so the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have a 25% chance for each of the four possible gamete combinations: CB, CB, cb, cb, cb, cb, etc.\u2014no, that's not right. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 would have a total of 16 possible combinations, each equally likely (assuming independent assortment).\n\nBut given that both parents are CcBB and ccbb, which are homozygous, the F2 would have a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene. However, since the F2 is the product of two homozygous parents, the actual F2 genotypes would follow a different distribution due to linkage and crossing over, but since these are independent genes, it simplifies.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me instead construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes CB.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs (CCBB \u00d7 ccbb?), no\u2014wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nSo the F2 would have the following possible gametes:\n\n- From F1 (CcBb), the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 population would consist of four possible combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSince each gamete is produced with equal likelihood (50% CB, 50% cb), the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes based on dominance:\n\n- Cc BB: C is present (red) and B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: C is present (red) and B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc Bb: C is absent (plain) but B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 out of 4 (since two of the four F2 genotypes fall into this category)\n- Checkered brown: 1 out of 4\n- Plain red: 2 out of 4\n- Plain brown: 1 out of 4\n\nWait, but that adds up to 6 parts instead of 16. That suggests I'm miscalculating. Actually, each of the four F2 genotypes corresponds to four individuals. So:\n\n- Two individuals are Cc BB and Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (total 2)\n- One individual is cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (total 1)\n- Two individuals are cc bb \u2192 Plain red (total 2)\n- One individual is cc Bb \u2192 Wait, no, cc Bb is 25%, which is one individual. Wait, no, in reality, each F2 individual is 25% of the total. So, 16 individuals in total, each with 25% chance.\n\nSo in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 individuals (25%)\n- Checkered brown: 1 individual (25%)\n- Plain red: 2 individuals (25%)\n- Plain brown: 1 individual (25%)\n\nWait, that sums up to 6 individuals, but there are 16. This discrepancy arises because the Punnett square approach I used assumes equal distribution, but in reality, the F2 may have more variance due to recombination and other factors. However, since the parents are homozygous, there shouldn't be any recombination. Thus, each gene segregates independently, leading to the expected ratios.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 individual has 16 possible genotypes, but many will have the same phenotype. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (both C and B present)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (both C and B present)\n3. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (only B present)\n4. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (only C present)\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (only B present)\n6. cc bb \u2192 Plain red (none present)\n7. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n9. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n11. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n12. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n13. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n14. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n15. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n16. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nWait, this seems off. Actually, the F2 should have 16 individuals, each with a distinct genotype. Let me list them:\n\nEach F2 individual is formed by combining one allele from each parent. Since both parents are CcBB and ccbb, the F1 is CcBb. Then F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From Cc \u00d7 Cc: CC, Cc, cc\n- From Bb \u00d7 Bb: BB, Bb, bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red: Cases 7, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal cases: 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8. Wait, but there are 9 phenotypic categories (as per options A-D), but according to this, only 4 phenotypes exist. However, looking back, the options mention \"phenotypes,\" which could imply distinct observable traits regardless of the underlying genotype. In reality, the three phenotypes are Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, and Plain brown. So, four phenotypes.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nC.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nF.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum to 12\n\nK. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nL. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Same as K.\n\nWait, option K says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, summing to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12, which doesn't make sense. Option G is 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16, but the numbers don't seem to fit.\n\nLooking back at my previous count, the phenotypic ratios were 4 checkered red, 1 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown, totaling 8. But that contradicts the options. Perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\n- C is dominant, so any presence of C leads to red.\n- B is dominant, so any presence of B leads to brown.\n- Plain is when neither C nor B is present.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, since each parent contributes only one allele for each gene, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor Gene C: \n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut since the parents are homozygous, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor C:\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor B:\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would have a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene, but considering both genes together, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n[Parent 1 gametes] x [Parent 2 gametes]\n\nEach cell represents a combination. For example, if Parent 1 gametes are CB and Parent 2 are cb, then the F2 would be CcBb and ccbb. Similarly, CB gametes with cb make CcBb, and cb gametes with cb make ccbb.\n\nWait, but I might have confused the setup. Let me approach it differently. The F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\nGene C:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nGene B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are combinations of these. To get the phenotypes, I need to determine how these genotypes translate into animals. The dominance hierarchy is such that:\n\n- For C: C (red) > c (plain)\n- For B: B (brown) > b (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both alleles. The order matters because both genes are working together. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n10. c c bb \u2192 Checkered red?\n\nWait, no. Actually, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. If either gene is present, the color is determined by the dominant allele. So:\n\n- If C is present (either C or Cc), and B is present (either B or Bb), then the animal is checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is not (e.g., Cc bb), then the animal is checkered brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (c c bb), then the animal is plain red.\n- If B is present but C is not (e.g., cc BB), then the animal is plain brown.\n\nLet me verify that logic. Suppose the animal has at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B. Then it's checkered red. Otherwise, if it has C but not B, it's checkered brown. If it has neither C nor B, it's plain red. If it has B but not C, it's plain brown.\n\nNow, applying this to each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Only B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Only B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Only B present \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain red\n10. c c bb \u2192 Neither C nor B present \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but there are 10 possible F2 genotypes, but the actual number of unique phenotypes isn't 10 because some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. Let me count:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red: Cases 7, 9, 10 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain brown: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal cases: 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 9. Hmm, that doesn't add up because F2 should have 16 individuals if considering all possible gametes. Wait, no\u2014the F2 generation would have 16 individuals, but some may have identical phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the 16 possible F2 outcomes:\n\nLooking back, the 16 combinations would include all possible pairs from the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). But earlier, I thought of 10 because I considered only the gametes. Alternatively, each parent contributes two alleles, so the F2 would have 16 possible genotypes, each producing one individual. Among these, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better way is to calculate the number of each phenotype directly without enumerating all 16 possibilities. Using the rules above:\n\nNumber of Checkered red (C+ B present):\n\nIn terms of counts, for each gene, the probability of having C is 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 3/4 have C). Similarly for B, 3/4 have B. Assuming independent assortment, the probability of having at least one C and at least one B is (3/4)(3/4) - (probability of neither) = (9/16) - (1/16) = 8/16 = 1/2. So half the F2 would be Checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown occurs when C is present but B is absent. Probability of C is 3/4, B absent is 1/4 \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. So 3/16 of F2 are Checkered brown.\n\nPlain red occurs when neither C nor B is present. Probability of neither is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So 1/16 of F2 are Plain red.\n\nPlain brown occurs when B is present but C is absent. Probability of B is 3/4, C absent is 1/4 \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. So 3/16 of F2 are Plain brown.\n\nAdding them up: 8/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 = 17/16, which exceeds 1. That indicates a mistake in calculation. Clearly, something is wrong with my probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Instead of thinking in probabilities, let me consider the actual number of each genotype among the F2 population.\n\nThe F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. The F1 is CcBb, so it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can only give one allele, so the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have a 25% chance for each of the four possible gamete combinations: CB, CB, cb, cb, cb, cb, etc.\u2014no, that's not right. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele, so the F2 would have a total of 16 possible combinations, each equally likely (assuming independent assortment).\n\nBut given that both parents are CcBB and ccbb, which are homozygous, the F2 would have a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene. However, since the F2 is the product of two homozygous parents, the actual F2 genotypes would follow a different distribution due to linkage and crossing over, but since these are independent genes, it simplifies.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me instead construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce gametes CB.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce gametes cb.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be CcBb.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs (CCBB \u00d7 ccbb?), no\u2014wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so F2 would be F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nSo the F2 would have the following possible gametes:\n\n- From F1 (CcBb), the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 population would consist of four possible combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSince each gamete is produced with equal likelihood (50% CB, 50% cb), the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes based on dominance:\n\n- Cc BB: C is present (red) and B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: C is present (red) and B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc Bb: C is absent (plain) but B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 out of 4 (since two of the four F2 genotypes fall into this category)\n- Checkered brown: 1 out of 4\n- Plain red: 2 out of 4\n- Plain brown: 1 out of 4\n\nWait, but that adds up to 6 parts instead of 16. That suggests I'm miscalculating. Actually, each of the four F2 genotypes corresponds to four individuals. So:\n\n- Two individuals are Cc BB and Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (total 2)\n- One individual is cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (total 1)\n- Two individuals are cc bb \u2192 Plain red (total 2)\n- One individual is cc Bb \u2192 Wait, no, cc Bb is 25%, which is one individual. Wait, no, in reality, each F2 individual is 25% of the total. So, 16 individuals in total, each with 25% chance.\n\nSo in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 individuals (25%)\n- Checkered brown: 1 individual (25%)\n- Plain red: 2 individuals (25%)\n- Plain brown: 1 individual (25%)\n\nWait, that sums up to 6 individuals, but there are 16. This discrepancy arises because the Punnett square approach I used assumes equal distribution, but in reality, the F2 may have more variance due to recombination and other factors. However, since the parents are homozygous, there shouldn't be any recombination. Thus, each gene segregates independently, leading to the expected ratios.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 individual has 16 possible genotypes, but many will have the same phenotype. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (both C and B present)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (both C and B present)\n3. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (only B present)\n4. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (only C present)\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (only B present)\n6. cc bb \u2192 Plain red (none present)\n7. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n9. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n11. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n12. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n13. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n14. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n15. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n16. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nWait, this seems off. Actually, the F2 should have 16 individuals, each with a distinct genotype. Let me list them:\n\nEach F2 individual is formed by combining one allele from each parent. Since both parents are CcBB and ccbb, the F1 is CcBb. Then F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From Cc \u00d7 Cc: CC, Cc, cc\n- From Bb \u00d7 Bb: BB, Bb, bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain red: Cases 7, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal cases: 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8. Wait, but there are 9 phenotypic categories (as per options A-D), but according to this, only 4 phenotypes exist. However, looking back, the options mention \"phenotypes,\" which could imply distinct observable traits regardless of the underlying genotype. In reality, the three phenotypes are Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, and Plain brown. So, four phenotypes.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum to 12\n\nK. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum to 16\n\nL. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Same as K.\n\nWait, option K says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, summing to 16. Option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12, which doesn't make sense. Option G is 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16, but the numbers don't seem to fit.\n\nLooking back at my previous count, the phenotypic ratios were 4 checkered red, 1 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown, totaling 8. But that contradicts the options. Perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\n- C is dominant, so any presence of C leads to red.\n- B is dominant, so any presence of B leads to brown.\n- Plain is when neither C nor B is present.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes either CB or cb, leading to four possible F2 genotypes: CC (if both parents contribute CB?), Cc (if one contributes CB and the other cb), cc (both contributing cb), and bb (both contributing cb).",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes either CB or cb, leading to four possible F2 genotypes: CC (if both parents contribute CB?), Cc (if one contributes CB and the other cb), cc (both contributing cb), and bb (both contributing cb). But in reality, the F2 would have these probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBut we also need to consider the phenotype based on the combination of C/B and c/b. So let's map the phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C_: red (dominant)\n  - cc: plain (recessive)\n- Color (B):\n  - B_: brown (dominant)\n  - bb: checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the F2 individuals will have different combinations. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes along with their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C_): \n   - C_ (C) \u2192 red (C_)\n   - B_: brown (B_) \u2192 brown\n   So overall phenotype: red-brown\n\n2. Cc (Cc):\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown\n   Overall: red-brown\n\n3. Cc (Cc):\n   Same as above: red-brown\n\nWait, no\u2014it's the same as above. Actually, each individual is determined by their combination of C and B.\n\nLet me construct a table:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 C_ (red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 C_ (red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n- cc (25%) \u2192 cc (plain) and B_ (brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n- bb (25%) \u2192 bb (checkered) and B_ (brown) \u2192 checkered-brown\n\nWait, but some sources might combine the B traits differently. Alternatively, another way to look at it is that each trait is independent. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would depend on how many individuals fall into each category.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this systematically. The F2 generation consists of four phenotypic categories based on the combination of pigmentation (C vs. cc) and color (B vs. bb). Each trait is determined independently, so the number of phenotypes depends on the possible combinations.\n\nIn F2:\n- 25% CC (red) \u2192 red\n- 25% cc (plain) \u2192 plain\n- 50% Cc (red) \u2192 red\n- 25% bb (brown) \u2192 brown\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the interaction between the two genes. Actually, the correct approach is to determine the phenotypic classes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and then assign their phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes (based on independent assortment):\n\n1. CC (25%)\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown\n   \u2192 red-brown\n\n2. Cc (50%)\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown\n   \u2192 red-brown\n\n3. Cc (50%)\n   Same as above\n   \u2192 red-brown\n\n4. cc (25%)\n   - cc: plain\n   - B_: brown\n   \u2192 plain-brown\n\n5. bb (25%)\n   - bb: checkered\n   - B_: brown\n   \u2192 checkered-brown\n\nWait, but that's five categories, but according to the problem statement, the options don't include such a variety. However, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match this exact distribution. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering all possibilities. Alternatively, maybe the F2 generation is being considered without considering the dominance hierarchy, but instead focusing purely on the phenotypic classes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the actual phenotypic counts based on the number of each genotype in F2.\n\nLet me re-examine the F2 genotypes:\n\nEach parent is CcBb. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 will have four possible phenotypic classes based on the dominance of each gene. The phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) is typically 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: All individuals expressing both dominant traits.\n- 3: Individuals with one dominant and one recessive for pigment (e.g., C_B_).\n- 3: Individuals with one dominant and one recessive for color (e.g., C_bb).\n- 1: Individuals with both recessive traits (e.g., cc_bb).\n\nHowever, in our case, the phenotype isn't simply expressed as dominant or recessive for each gene; rather, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So, the phenotypic ratio would need to be calculated based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nSo, for each F2 individual:\n\n- If they have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_), and at least one dominant allele for color (B_), they exhibit red-brown.\n\n- If they have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_), but no dominant for color (bb), they exhibit plain-brown.\n\n- If they have no dominant allele for pigment (cc), but at least one dominant for color (B_), they exhibit checkered-brown.\n\n- If they have neither dominant alleles (cc and bb), they exhibit plain-checkered.\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each:\n\nUsing the formula for independent assortment:\n\nThe probability of having at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_) is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for color (B_) is 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability of having at least one dominant allele for both genes is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThus, 9/16 of the F2 individuals will be red-brown.\n\nNext, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_) but no dominant for color (bb) is:\n\n(3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThese will be plain-brown.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having no dominant allele for pigment (cc) but at least one dominant for color (B_) is:\n\n(1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nThese will be checkered-brown.\n\nFinally, the probability of having neither dominant alleles (cc and bb) is:\n\n(1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nThese will be plain-checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9/16\n- Plain-Brown: 3/16\n- Checkered-Brown: 3/16\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to align with my calculation if I miscounted. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, no. Option D is: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit my numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the phenotypic expression. Let me clarify:\n\nEach individual's phenotype is determined by whether they express the dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- If they have C_ and B_, they express both, resulting in red-brown.\n- If they have C_ and bb, they express C_, resulting in plain-brown.\n- If they have cc and B_, they express B_, resulting in checkered-brown.\n- If they have cc and bb, they don't express any, resulting in plain-checkered.\n\nSo, the correct counts are:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Plain-Brown: 3\n- Checkered-Brown: 3\n- Plain-Checkered: 1\n\nTotal: 16\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. No.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2. No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1. Yes! That matches exactly what I calculated.\n\nSo, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes either CB or cb, leading to four possible F2 genotypes: CC (if both parents contribute CB?), Cc (if one contributes CB and the other cb), cc (both contributing cb), and bb (both contributing cb). But in reality, the F2 would have these probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nBut we also need to consider the phenotype based on the combination of C/B and c/b. So let's map the phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C_: red (dominant)\n  - cc: plain (recessive)\n- Color (B):\n  - B_: brown (dominant)\n  - bb: checkered (recessive)\n\nSo the F2 individuals will have different combinations. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes along with their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C_): \n   - C_ (C) \u2192 red (C_)\n   - B_: brown (B_) \u2192 brown\n   So overall phenotype: red-brown\n\n2. Cc (Cc):\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown\n   Overall: red-brown\n\n3. Cc (Cc):\n   Same as above: red-brown\n\nWait, no\u2014it's the same as above. Actually, each individual is determined by their combination of C and B.\n\nLet me construct a table:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 C_ (red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 C_ (red) and B_ (brown) \u2192 red-brown\n- cc (25%) \u2192 cc (plain) and B_ (brown) \u2192 plain-brown\n- bb (25%) \u2192 bb (checkered) and B_ (brown) \u2192 checkered-brown\n\nWait, but some sources might combine the B traits differently. Alternatively, another way to look at it is that each trait is independent. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would depend on how many individuals fall into each category.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this systematically. The F2 generation consists of four phenotypic categories based on the combination of pigmentation (C vs. cc) and color (B vs. bb). Each trait is determined independently, so the number of phenotypes depends on the possible combinations.\n\nIn F2:\n- 25% CC (red) \u2192 red\n- 25% cc (plain) \u2192 plain\n- 50% Cc (red) \u2192 red\n- 25% bb (brown) \u2192 brown\n\nWait, but that doesn't account for the interaction between the two genes. Actually, the correct approach is to determine the phenotypic classes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and then assign their phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes (based on independent assortment):\n\n1. CC (25%)\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown\n   \u2192 red-brown\n\n2. Cc (50%)\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown\n   \u2192 red-brown\n\n3. Cc (50%)\n   Same as above\n   \u2192 red-brown\n\n4. cc (25%)\n   - cc: plain\n   - B_: brown\n   \u2192 plain-brown\n\n5. bb (25%)\n   - bb: checkered\n   - B_: brown\n   \u2192 checkered-brown\n\nWait, but that's five categories, but according to the problem statement, the options don't include such a variety. However, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match this exact distribution. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering all possibilities. Alternatively, maybe the F2 generation is being considered without considering the dominance hierarchy, but instead focusing purely on the phenotypic classes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the actual phenotypic counts based on the number of each genotype in F2.\n\nLet me re-examine the F2 genotypes:\n\nEach parent is CcBb. In a dihybrid cross, the F2 will have four possible phenotypic classes based on the dominance of each gene. The phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) is typically 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: All individuals expressing both dominant traits.\n- 3: Individuals with one dominant and one recessive for pigment (e.g., C_B_).\n- 3: Individuals with one dominant and one recessive for color (e.g., C_bb).\n- 1: Individuals with both recessive traits (e.g., cc_bb).\n\nHowever, in our case, the phenotype isn't simply expressed as dominant or recessive for each gene; rather, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So, the phenotypic ratio would need to be calculated based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nSo, for each F2 individual:\n\n- If they have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_), and at least one dominant allele for color (B_), they exhibit red-brown.\n\n- If they have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_), but no dominant for color (bb), they exhibit plain-brown.\n\n- If they have no dominant allele for pigment (cc), but at least one dominant for color (B_), they exhibit checkered-brown.\n\n- If they have neither dominant alleles (cc and bb), they exhibit plain-checkered.\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each:\n\nUsing the formula for independent assortment:\n\nThe probability of having at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_) is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for color (B_) is 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability of having at least one dominant allele for both genes is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nThus, 9/16 of the F2 individuals will be red-brown.\n\nNext, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_) but no dominant for color (bb) is:\n\n(3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nThese will be plain-brown.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having no dominant allele for pigment (cc) but at least one dominant for color (B_) is:\n\n(1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nThese will be checkered-brown.\n\nFinally, the probability of having neither dominant alleles (cc and bb) is:\n\n(1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nThese will be plain-checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9/16\n- Plain-Brown: 3/16\n- Checkered-Brown: 3/16\n- Plain-Checkered: 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to align with my calculation if I miscounted. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, no. Option D is: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit my numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the phenotypic expression. Let me clarify:\n\nEach individual's phenotype is determined by whether they express the dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- If they have C_ and B_, they express both, resulting in red-brown.\n- If they have C_ and bb, they express C_, resulting in plain-brown.\n- If they have cc and B_, they express B_, resulting in checkered-brown.\n- If they have cc and bb, they don't express any, resulting in plain-checkered.\n\nSo, the correct counts are:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Plain-Brown: 3\n- Checkered-Brown: 3\n- Plain-Checkered: 1\n\nTotal: 16\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. No.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2. No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1. Yes! That matches exactly what I calculated.\n\nSo, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, in reality, the F1 is CcBb, which means it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each 25% chance.",
    "rollout": " However, in reality, the F1 is CcBb, which means it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each 25% chance. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, I might have made a mistake here. Because the F1 is CcBb, which when crossed with itself, can produce:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that's assuming independent assortment, which might not hold perfectly in reality, but for the sake of this problem, we'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, the next part is determining the phenotypes. Phenotype depends on both the combination of alleles and the dominance hierarchy. So:\n\n- Pigment color (B vs b): \n  - Dominant B \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 checkered (from cc)\n  \n- Pigmentation (B vs b):\n  - Dominant B \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 plain (from cc)\n\n- Color pattern (B vs b):\n  - Dominant B \u2192 black\n  - Recessive b \u2192 white (but in this case, since the birds are either black or white, but the options mention brown and plain, perhaps considering brown as dominant over black?)\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" And \"Red\" seems to be another phenotype, but in the context of the problem, I think the primary focus is on the dominance hierarchy between C (red) and c (plain), and B (brown) and b (checkered).\n\nSo, the key is that:\n\n- C dominates over c.\n- B dominates over b.\n\nTherefore, any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (B or C) will be brown or red. Only if both are recessive (cb) will it be plain or checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for the color pattern (black vs white):\n\n- B dominates over b.\n\nSo, any bird with B will be black; those with b will be white.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFor a bird to be checkered (white), it must have alleles c (for pigment) and b (for color pattern). So genotype cc bb.\n\nTo be plain (white), same as checkered.\n\nTo be red (brown), needs at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or B) and any color pattern (B or b). But since B is dominant, having B ensures red regardless of color pattern.\n\nTo be brown (red), you need at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or B) and any color pattern (B or b). But since B is dominant, even without b, it's red.\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- If the bird is c (pigment) and b (color pattern), then it's checkered (white).\n- Any bird that has at least one dominant allele (C or B) in pigment will be brown (red).\n- Any bird with a c (pigment) but at least one dominant allele (B) will be brown (red).\n- Any bird with a b (color pattern) and at least one dominant allele (B) will be brown (red).\n- Only if both pigment and color pattern are recessive (cb), then it's plain (white).\n\nSo, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered (white): genotype cc bb\n2. Plain (white): same as checkered\n3. Brown (red): any bird where pigment is not c (i.e., has at least C or B), and color pattern is not b (i.e., has at least B)\n4. Red (brown): same as brown above\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the colors are determined by both genes. So the order matters. Pigmentation is determined by gene B, color pattern by gene C. So a bird that is B (brown) and/or C (red) will be red (brown). If a bird is c (plain) and/or b (checkered), it won't be red (brown); it'll be plain (white).\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c and b)\n- Plain: same as checkered\n- Brown (red): at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or B) and any color pattern (B or b)\n- Red (brown): same as brown\n\nThus, the F2 generation will have these four phenotypes.\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nThe F2 generation is derived from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought F2 includes:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), bb (25%)\n\nBut now, applying the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Checkered (white): cc bb (only one genotype)\n- Plain (white): same as checkered\n- Brown (red): all except cc bb, including Cc, CC, CcBb, etc.\n- Red (brown): all except cc bb, including ccBb, etc.\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate. Because the phenotype depends on the combination of both genes. So, the actual count depends on how many birds fall into each category.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 C is dominant (red), and c is recessive (plain). Since C is dominant, this bird will be red (brown). So, brown.\n\n2. Cc (25%) \u2192 C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). Again, red. Brown.\n\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 c (plain) and c (pigment). So, plain. White.\n\n4. bb (25%) \u2192 b (checkered) and b (pigment). So, checkered. White.\n\nNow, what about the other combinations?\n\nWait, but the F2 genotypes also include CcBb and others. For example, CcBb could be broken down as Cc (pigment) and Bb (color pattern). \n\nFor CcBb:\n\n- Pigmentation: C is dominant, so red.\n- Color pattern: B is dominant, so black.\n\nWait, but the problem says that color pattern is determined by gene C, right? Because the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red is determined by C, plain by c. Similarly, \"brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; and brown by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, color pattern is determined by gene C (C for red, c for plain), and pigment color is determined by gene B (B for brown, b for checkered).\n\nThus, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes' dominance.\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype, the phenotype is:\n\n- If both C and B are present (at least one dominant allele), then the bird is brown (red).\n- If one or both are recessive (both c and b), then the bird is white (checkered).\n\nNow, let's evaluate all F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC: C is dominant, so red. Brown.\n\n2. Cc: C is dominant, so red. Brown.\n\n3. cc: c is recessive for both, so plain. White.\n\n4. bb: b is recessive for both, so checkered. White.\n\n5. CcBb: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown). Brown.\n\n6. Ccbb: C dominant (red), b (checkered). Brown.\n\n7. ccBb: c (plain), B (brown). Brown.\n\n8. ccbb: c (plain), b (checkered). White.\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Brown (red): Cases 1,2,5,6,7 \u2192 5 cases\n- White (checkered): Cases 3,8 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but in the F2, the total number of birds should be 16 (since each F1 (4 gametes) \u00d7 F1 (4 gametes) = 16).\n\nBut wait, earlier I had 4 types of genotypes, each 25%. But the actual F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of both genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square approach:\n\nF1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nEach gene segregates independently.\n\nFor the pigment (B/B):\n\n- C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C is red. Those with cc remain plain.\n\nFor the color pattern (C/C):\n\n- B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B is brown. Those with cb remain checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C (C_), it's red. Within that, if it has at least one B (B_), it's brown. Otherwise, it's plain (white).\n\nSimilarly, within the C_ group, if B_ is present, it's brown. Else, it's plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypic breakdown:\n\n- Brown (red): All birds with C_ and B_. Which includes:\n\n  - C_ B_: \u00be of the time\n  - C_ b_: \u00be of the time\n\nBut within each, the exact distribution depends on the gametes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the probabilities.\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), the segregation is:\n\n- For pigment (B/B): 25% C_, 25% cc (plain)\n- For color pattern (C/C): 25% B_, 25% cb (checkered)\n\nSince these are independent, the combined probability is:\n\n- Both C_ and B_: (25% C_) \u00d7 (25% B_) = 6.25%\n- C_ and cb: 6.25%\n- cc and B_: 6.25%\n- cc and cb: 6.25%\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right because the segregation isn't independent in the same way as for a single gene. Actually, for each gene, the segregation is independent, but the overall F2 will have combinations based on both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities, then determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe possible genotypes for F2 are:\n\n1. CC: 25%\n2. Cc: 25%\n3. cc: 25%\n4. bb: 25%\n\nBut within each of these, some may express different phenotypes based on both genes.\n\nHowever, this approach might not capture the interaction between both genes correctly. Instead, perhaps a more straightforward method is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 population.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross with two genes, the expected phenotypic ratio can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPhenotype ratio = (number of phenotypically distinct groups) / (total number of groups)\n\nWhere each group corresponds to a unique phenotype.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Checkered (white): cc bb\n- Plain (white): same as checkered\n- Brown (red): any bird with at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or B), and any color pattern (B or b)\n- Red (brown): same as brown\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered: 1/16\n2. Plain: 1/16\n3. Brown: 12/16 (since 12 out of 16 birds will have at least one dominant allele in pigment)\n4. Red: 2/16 (since 2 out of 16 birds will have both dominant alleles)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's recalculate:\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals is 16.\n\nNumber of checkered (cc bb): 1 (only one genotype, cc bb)\n\nNumber of plain (same as checkered): 1\n\nNumber of brown (any bird with at least one dominant allele in pigment): Let's see:\n\n- C_ B_: \u00be of the time (since C_ is 75% and B_ is 75%, but we're multiplying them because they're independent)\nWait, no, the correct approach is to consider that for each gene, the probability is:\n\nP(C_) = \u00be\nP(B_) = \u00be\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of both being present is \u00be * \u00be = 9/16. But wait, that's the probability of a bird being brown. However, within these 9/16, some are checkered and some are plain.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWithin the 9/16 that have C_, how many are brown (have B_)? That's \u00be of 9/16, which is 9/16 * 3/4 = 27/64.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of birds that fit each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered (cc bb): 1 bird (1/16)\n- Plain (cc bb): same as checkered, so 1/16\n- Brown (C_ B_): How many? In F2, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in both genes is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16, but this counts all brown birds, including those who are also checkered (like C_ b_). But wait, in the F2, the presence of at least one dominant allele in pigment (C_ or B_) leads to brown. Among those, some have B_ (brown) and some don't (checkered).\n\nWait, no, because for the color pattern, the presence of B_ makes the bird brown, while cb remains checkered.\n\nSo, within the 9/16 that have C_ (pigment), half of them will have B_ (brown) and half will have b_ (checkered). Similarly, within the 3/16 that have cc (pigment), none will have B_ (since B is needed for brown), so they'll be plain.\n\nWait, let's do this properly:\n\n- Total F2: 16\n\n- Number of birds with C_ (pigment): 12 (since \u00be of 16 is 12)\n  - Of these 12, how many have B_? 12 \u00d7 (3/4) = 9\n  - So, 9 birds with C_ B_ \u2192 brown\n  - Remaining 3 birds with C_ cb \u2192 checkered\n\n- Number of birds with cc (pigment): 4 (since \u00bc of 16 is 4)\n  - None of these will have B_ \u2192 all plain\n\n- Number of birds with bb (color pattern): 4 (since \u00bc of 16 is 4)\n  - None of these will have C_ \u2192 all checkered\n\nAdding up:\n\n- Brown (red): 9\n- Checkered (white): 4 + 4 = 8\n- Plain (white): 4\n- Red (brown): Wait, no. Brown (red) is already covered by the 9.\n\nWait, I think I mixed up. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the 12 birds with C_:\n\n- 9 have B_ \u2192 brown\n- 3 have b_ \u2192 checkered\n\nFrom the 4 birds with cc:\n\n- 4 have neither C nor B \u2192 plain\n\nFrom the 4 birds with bb:\n\n- 4 have neither C nor B \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (red): 9\n- Checkered (white): 3 (cc) + 4 (bb) = 7\n- Plain (white): 4 (cc)\n  \nWait, that sums to 9 + 7 + 4 = 20, which is more than 16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, in reality, the F1 is CcBb, which means it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each 25% chance. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, I might have made a mistake here. Because the F1 is CcBb, which when crossed with itself, can produce:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but that's assuming independent assortment, which might not hold perfectly in reality, but for the sake of this problem, we'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, the next part is determining the phenotypes. Phenotype depends on both the combination of alleles and the dominance hierarchy. So:\n\n- Pigment color (B vs b): \n  - Dominant B \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 checkered (from cc)\n  \n- Pigmentation (B vs b):\n  - Dominant B \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 plain (from cc)\n\n- Color pattern (B vs b):\n  - Dominant B \u2192 black\n  - Recessive b \u2192 white (but in this case, since the birds are either black or white, but the options mention brown and plain, perhaps considering brown as dominant over black?)\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" And \"Red\" seems to be another phenotype, but in the context of the problem, I think the primary focus is on the dominance hierarchy between C (red) and c (plain), and B (brown) and b (checkered).\n\nSo, the key is that:\n\n- C dominates over c.\n- B dominates over b.\n\nTherefore, any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (B or C) will be brown or red. Only if both are recessive (cb) will it be plain or checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for the color pattern (black vs white):\n\n- B dominates over b.\n\nSo, any bird with B will be black; those with b will be white.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFor a bird to be checkered (white), it must have alleles c (for pigment) and b (for color pattern). So genotype cc bb.\n\nTo be plain (white), same as checkered.\n\nTo be red (brown), needs at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or B) and any color pattern (B or b). But since B is dominant, having B ensures red regardless of color pattern.\n\nTo be brown (red), you need at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or B) and any color pattern (B or b). But since B is dominant, even without b, it's red.\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- If the bird is c (pigment) and b (color pattern), then it's checkered (white).\n- Any bird that has at least one dominant allele (C or B) in pigment will be brown (red).\n- Any bird with a c (pigment) but at least one dominant allele (B) will be brown (red).\n- Any bird with a b (color pattern) and at least one dominant allele (B) will be brown (red).\n- Only if both pigment and color pattern are recessive (cb), then it's plain (white).\n\nSo, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered (white): genotype cc bb\n2. Plain (white): same as checkered\n3. Brown (red): any bird where pigment is not c (i.e., has at least C or B), and color pattern is not b (i.e., has at least B)\n4. Red (brown): same as brown above\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the colors are determined by both genes. So the order matters. Pigmentation is determined by gene B, color pattern by gene C. So a bird that is B (brown) and/or C (red) will be red (brown). If a bird is c (plain) and/or b (checkered), it won't be red (brown); it'll be plain (white).\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c and b)\n- Plain: same as checkered\n- Brown (red): at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or B) and any color pattern (B or b)\n- Red (brown): same as brown\n\nThus, the F2 generation will have these four phenotypes.\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nThe F2 generation is derived from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought F2 includes:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), bb (25%)\n\nBut now, applying the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Checkered (white): cc bb (only one genotype)\n- Plain (white): same as checkered\n- Brown (red): all except cc bb, including Cc, CC, CcBb, etc.\n- Red (brown): all except cc bb, including ccBb, etc.\n\nBut wait, that's not accurate. Because the phenotype depends on the combination of both genes. So, the actual count depends on how many birds fall into each category.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (25%) \u2192 C is dominant (red), and c is recessive (plain). Since C is dominant, this bird will be red (brown). So, brown.\n\n2. Cc (25%) \u2192 C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). Again, red. Brown.\n\n3. cc (25%) \u2192 c (plain) and c (pigment). So, plain. White.\n\n4. bb (25%) \u2192 b (checkered) and b (pigment). So, checkered. White.\n\nNow, what about the other combinations?\n\nWait, but the F2 genotypes also include CcBb and others. For example, CcBb could be broken down as Cc (pigment) and Bb (color pattern). \n\nFor CcBb:\n\n- Pigmentation: C is dominant, so red.\n- Color pattern: B is dominant, so black.\n\nWait, but the problem says that color pattern is determined by gene C, right? Because the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red is determined by C, plain by c. Similarly, \"brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; and brown by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo, color pattern is determined by gene C (C for red, c for plain), and pigment color is determined by gene B (B for brown, b for checkered).\n\nThus, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes' dominance.\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype, the phenotype is:\n\n- If both C and B are present (at least one dominant allele), then the bird is brown (red).\n- If one or both are recessive (both c and b), then the bird is white (checkered).\n\nNow, let's evaluate all F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC: C is dominant, so red. Brown.\n\n2. Cc: C is dominant, so red. Brown.\n\n3. cc: c is recessive for both, so plain. White.\n\n4. bb: b is recessive for both, so checkered. White.\n\n5. CcBb: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown). Brown.\n\n6. Ccbb: C dominant (red), b (checkered). Brown.\n\n7. ccBb: c (plain), B (brown). Brown.\n\n8. ccbb: c (plain), b (checkered). White.\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Brown (red): Cases 1,2,5,6,7 \u2192 5 cases\n- White (checkered): Cases 3,8 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but in the F2, the total number of birds should be 16 (since each F1 (4 gametes) \u00d7 F1 (4 gametes) = 16).\n\nBut wait, earlier I had 4 types of genotypes, each 25%. But the actual F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of both genes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square approach:\n\nF1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nEach gene segregates independently.\n\nFor the pigment (B/B):\n\n- C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C is red. Those with cc remain plain.\n\nFor the color pattern (C/C):\n\n- B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B is brown. Those with cb remain checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C (C_), it's red. Within that, if it has at least one B (B_), it's brown. Otherwise, it's plain (white).\n\nSimilarly, within the C_ group, if B_ is present, it's brown. Else, it's plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypic breakdown:\n\n- Brown (red): All birds with C_ and B_. Which includes:\n\n  - C_ B_: \u00be of the time\n  - C_ b_: \u00be of the time\n\nBut within each, the exact distribution depends on the gametes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the probabilities.\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), the segregation is:\n\n- For pigment (B/B): 25% C_, 25% cc (plain)\n- For color pattern (C/C): 25% B_, 25% cb (checkered)\n\nSince these are independent, the combined probability is:\n\n- Both C_ and B_: (25% C_) \u00d7 (25% B_) = 6.25%\n- C_ and cb: 6.25%\n- cc and B_: 6.25%\n- cc and cb: 6.25%\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right because the segregation isn't independent in the same way as for a single gene. Actually, for each gene, the segregation is independent, but the overall F2 will have combinations based on both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities, then determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe possible genotypes for F2 are:\n\n1. CC: 25%\n2. Cc: 25%\n3. cc: 25%\n4. bb: 25%\n\nBut within each of these, some may express different phenotypes based on both genes.\n\nHowever, this approach might not capture the interaction between both genes correctly. Instead, perhaps a more straightforward method is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 population.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross with two genes, the expected phenotypic ratio can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPhenotype ratio = (number of phenotypically distinct groups) / (total number of groups)\n\nWhere each group corresponds to a unique phenotype.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Checkered (white): cc bb\n- Plain (white): same as checkered\n- Brown (red): any bird with at least one dominant allele in pigment (C or B), and any color pattern (B or b)\n- Red (brown): same as brown\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered: 1/16\n2. Plain: 1/16\n3. Brown: 12/16 (since 12 out of 16 birds will have at least one dominant allele in pigment)\n4. Red: 2/16 (since 2 out of 16 birds will have both dominant alleles)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's recalculate:\n\nTotal number of F2 individuals is 16.\n\nNumber of checkered (cc bb): 1 (only one genotype, cc bb)\n\nNumber of plain (same as checkered): 1\n\nNumber of brown (any bird with at least one dominant allele in pigment): Let's see:\n\n- C_ B_: \u00be of the time (since C_ is 75% and B_ is 75%, but we're multiplying them because they're independent)\nWait, no, the correct approach is to consider that for each gene, the probability is:\n\nP(C_) = \u00be\nP(B_) = \u00be\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of both being present is \u00be * \u00be = 9/16. But wait, that's the probability of a bird being brown. However, within these 9/16, some are checkered and some are plain.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWithin the 9/16 that have C_, how many are brown (have B_)? That's \u00be of 9/16, which is 9/16 * 3/4 = 27/64.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of birds that fit each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered (cc bb): 1 bird (1/16)\n- Plain (cc bb): same as checkered, so 1/16\n- Brown (C_ B_): How many? In F2, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in both genes is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16, but this counts all brown birds, including those who are also checkered (like C_ b_). But wait, in the F2, the presence of at least one dominant allele in pigment (C_ or B_) leads to brown. Among those, some have B_ (brown) and some don't (checkered).\n\nWait, no, because for the color pattern, the presence of B_ makes the bird brown, while cb remains checkered.\n\nSo, within the 9/16 that have C_ (pigment), half of them will have B_ (brown) and half will have b_ (checkered). Similarly, within the 3/16 that have cc (pigment), none will have B_ (since B is needed for brown), so they'll be plain.\n\nWait, let's do this properly:\n\n- Total F2: 16\n\n- Number of birds with C_ (pigment): 12 (since \u00be of 16 is 12)\n  - Of these 12, how many have B_? 12 \u00d7 (3/4) = 9\n  - So, 9 birds with C_ B_ \u2192 brown\n  - Remaining 3 birds with C_ cb \u2192 checkered\n\n- Number of birds with cc (pigment): 4 (since \u00bc of 16 is 4)\n  - None of these will have B_ \u2192 all plain\n\n- Number of birds with bb (color pattern): 4 (since \u00bc of 16 is 4)\n  - None of these will have C_ \u2192 all checkered\n\nAdding up:\n\n- Brown (red): 9\n- Checkered (white): 4 + 4 = 8\n- Plain (white): 4\n- Red (brown): Wait, no. Brown (red) is already covered by the 9.\n\nWait, I think I mixed up. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the 12 birds with C_:\n\n- 9 have B_ \u2192 brown\n- 3 have b_ \u2192 checkered\n\nFrom the 4 birds with cc:\n\n- 4 have neither C nor B \u2192 plain\n\nFrom the 4 birds with bb:\n\n- 4 have neither C nor B \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (red): 9\n- Checkered (white): 3 (cc) + 4 (bb) = 7\n- Plain (white): 4 (cc)\n  \nWait, that sums to 9 + 7 + 4 = 20, which is more than 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake somewhere.\n\nAh, I realize now. The 9 birds with C_ B_ \u2192 brown\nThe remaining 12 - 9 = 3 birds with C_ cb \u2192 checkered\nThe 4 birds with cc \u2192 plain\nThe 4 birds with bb \u2192 checkered\n\nSo total:\n\n- Brown: 9\n- Checkered: 3 (from cb) + 4 (from bb) = 7\n- Plain: 4\n\nThis adds up to 20, which exceeds 16. This indicates an error in my reasoning. Perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Use a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.

Each gene is independently assorting, so we can calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor gene C (dominant C is red, recessive c is plain):\n- The probability of C (red) is 3/4 (since there are three possible genotypes: CC, Cc, and cc; and the chance of C being present is 3/4).\n- The probability of c (plain) is 1/4.\n\nFor gene B (dominant B is brown, recessive b is checkered):\n- Similarly, the probability of B (brown) is 3/4.\n- The probability of b (checkered) is 1/4.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (3/4) and B (3/4): Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. C (3/4) and b (1/4): Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. c (1/4) and B (3/4): Plain red (cc_B_)\n4. c (1/4) and b (1/4): Plain brown (ccc_b)\n\nBut wait, the combination is CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, and ccbb. Now, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: Checkered red\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- ccBB: Plain red\n- ccbb: Plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the proportion for each phenotype:\n\n- For Checkered red (CcBB): Probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- For Checkered brown (CcBb): Probability = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- For Plain red (ccBB): Probability = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- For Plain brown (ccbb): Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option H says \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" also not matching. Option A: 6,2,6,2. Option D: 1,3,9,3. Option E: 3,9,1,3. Option J: 2,6,3,1.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match exactly. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. Perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the F2 isn't 16 genotypes but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the parent's genotypes are different. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so F1 is CcBb. F2 would then produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but if the F1 is CcBb, which is a dihybrid cross, the F2 would have 9 possible genotypic combinations, each with certain probabilities. Let me recompute the probabilities for each phenotype correctly.\n\nEach gene's segregation is independent, so the probabilities are multiplied. For each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): C must be present, B must be present. So probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): C present, B absent. So 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Plain red (cc_B_): c present, B present. So 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Plain brown (cccc_): c present, b present. Wait, no\u2014wait, the genotype for plain brown is ccbb, right? Because B is present only if B is present in at least one allele. Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype depends on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- For each gene, if at least one dominant allele is present, the bird is expressed according to the dominant trait.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered (c) and red (C): Checkered red (C_B_)\n- Checkered (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown (C_bb)\n-Plain (c) and red (C): Plain red (cc_B_)\n-Plain (c) and brown (B): Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nThus, the probabilities are as before: 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly reflect this. Let's look again at the options provided:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum=16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum=16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum=16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192 Sum=16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192Sum=16\nF.4,4,4,4\u2192Sum=16\nG.12,2,2,0\u2192Sum=16\nH.5,3,2,6\u2192Sum=16\nI.7,5,1,3\u2192Sum=16\nJ.2,6,3,1\u2192Sum=12\n\nWait, my calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which matches option C. But looking at the options, option C is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that's what I calculated.\n\nHowever, looking back, I might have miscalculated. Let me verify again:\n\nFor each phenotype, the probability is:\n\n- C_B_: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C_bb: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- cc_B_: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- cc_bb: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. So the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, checking the options, option C states \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which aligns perfectly with my calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the user included several options like D and others, which include different numbers. I need to make sure I didn't mix up any letters. The options are labeled from A to J, each with specific counts. Option C corresponds to 9:3:3:1, which fits my calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering the actual cross, it's better to construct the Punnett square properly. However, given the options, perhaps it's easier to proceed to determine the phenotypes based on the F2.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically for the F2 generation, which comes after the F1 selfing. The F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. Each gene is independently assorting, so we can calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor gene C (dominant C is red, recessive c is plain):\n- The probability of C (red) is 3/4 (since there are three possible genotypes: CC, Cc, and cc; and the chance of C being present is 3/4).\n- The probability of c (plain) is 1/4.\n\nFor gene B (dominant B is brown, recessive b is checkered):\n- Similarly, the probability of B (brown) is 3/4.\n- The probability of b (checkered) is 1/4.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (3/4) and B (3/4): Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. C (3/4) and b (1/4): Checkered brown (C_bb)\n3. c (1/4) and B (3/4): Plain red (cc_B_)\n4. c (1/4) and b (1/4): Plain brown (ccc_b)\n\nBut wait, the combination is CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, and ccbb. Now, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: Checkered red\n- CcBb: Checkered brown\n- ccBB: Plain red\n- ccbb: Plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the proportion for each phenotype:\n\n- For Checkered red (CcBB): Probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- For Checkered brown (CcBb): Probability = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- For Plain red (ccBB): Probability = (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- For Plain brown (ccbb): Probability = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option H says \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" also not matching. Option A: 6,2,6,2. Option D: 1,3,9,3. Option E: 3,9,1,3. Option J: 2,6,3,1.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match exactly. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. Perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the F2 isn't 16 genotypes but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the parent's genotypes are different. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so F1 is CcBb.

For each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): C must be present, B must be present. So probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): C present, B absent. So 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Plain red (cc_B_): c present, B present. So 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Plain brown (cccc_): c present, b present. Wait, no\u2014wait, the genotype for plain brown is ccbb, right? Because B is present only if B is present in at least one allele. Wait, no\u2014wait, the phenotype depends on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- For each gene, if at least one dominant allele is present, the bird is expressed according to the dominant trait.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered (c) and red (C): Checkered red (C_B_)\n- Checkered (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown (C_bb)\n-Plain (c) and red (C): Plain red (cc_B_)\n-Plain (c) and brown (B): Plain brown (cc_bb)\n\nThus, the probabilities are as before: 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly reflect this.

So F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Their phenotypes would depend on the combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because in F1 (CcBb), each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F2 would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (red, checkered)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (red, checkered)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (red, checkered)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CC BB, Cc Bb, Cc Bb, and cc bb. Now, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant, so red, checkered.\n- Cc Bb: C is dominant, B is dominant, so red, checkered.\n- Cc BB: Wait, if there's a typo here\u2014probably Cc Bb, not Cc BB. Assuming it's Cc Bb, same phenotype as above.\n- cc bb: Both recessive, so plain, checkered.\n\nTherefore, in F2, all the birds would either be red, checkered or plain, checkered. So the phenotypic ratio would be: red, checkered : plain, checkered.\n\nLooking at the options given, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, but according to my analysis, none of the birds would express brown color because both B and b are recessive. Wait, did I misinterpret the question?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to checkered, while the presence of at least one dominant allele for B leads to brown. Oh! That changes things. So both B and b affect color, and both are recessive for being plain. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C or at least one B, it'll be red, checkered.\n- If a bird has at least one c or at least one b, it'll be plain, checkered.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it's red, checkered. Only if it doesn't have any dominant alleles does it become plain, checkered. So:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant C or dominant B \u2192 red, checkered\n- Dominant c or dominant b \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nThus, the only way a bird isn't red, checkered is if it has neither dominant C nor dominant B, i.e., it must have recessive c and recessive b alleles. So, only the genotype cc bb would be plain, checkered, and all others (including those with one dominant and one recessive) would be red, checkered.\n\nWait, but wait again. The problem statement also mentions \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C\" and \"brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B\". So both colors have dominant alleles, but only if at least one dominant allele is present do you get the respective color. So:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it's red, checkered. Only if a bird has neither dominant C nor dominant B, it becomes plain, checkered.\n\nSo in F2, all birds except those with cc bb would be red, checkered. All other birds (those with at least one dominant allele) would be red, checkered, and the ones without any dominant alleles (only cc bb) would be plain, checkered.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 genotypes. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red, checkered\n- Cc BB: red, checkered\n- CC Bb: red, checkered\n- Cc Bb: red, checkered\n- cc BB: plain, checkered\n- Cc bb: red, checkered\n- cc Bb: red, checkered\n- cc bb: plain, checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are dominant. For example, Cc Bb: C is dominant, B is dominant \u2192 red, checkered. Similarly, Cc Bb again. Similarly, cc bb is plain, checkered.\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014no, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to red, checkered. So any bird that has at least one dominant allele in either C or B will be red, checkered. Only those with both recessive alleles (c and b) will be plain, checkered.\n\nSo in F2, all birds except the ones with cc bb will be red, checkered. How many such birds are there?\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nOut of these, only cc bb is plain, checkered. All others are red, checkered.\n\nSo the number of red, checkered birds is 75%, and plain, checkered is 25%.\n\nBut wait, the options don't seem to match this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of them say plain, checkered is 25% of the population. Unless I've misunderstood something.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the problem considers both B and b separately affecting color, but only in certain ways. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Wait, but the problem states both C and B are dominant, leading to red, checkered. Only when both are recessive do they become plain, checkered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different dominance hierarchy, like B is dominant over c, and c is dominant over b. But the problem states explicitly that c is recessive, so only c affects plain, checkered.\n\nWait, but then in F2, only 25% are plain, checkered, and the rest are red, checkered. So the phenotypic ratio would be 75% red, checkered : 25% plain, checkered.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Option A is 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\u2014so they are considering both checkered and brown separately. Maybe the problem treats B and b differently, but the user's original problem didn't specify that. Wait, re-reading the problem:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Here's where I might have made a mistake. The problem seems to treat B and b as separate traits. So perhaps the color is determined by two independent genes: one determining checkered (C) and one determining color (B). So, if an individual has at least one dominant allele for either gene, they will exhibit that trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So plain color is when both alleles are recessive for color. And \"brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b\"\u2014wait, that conflicts because if b is recessive for color, then having at least one b allele would make it brown. But earlier, it said that c is recessive for color. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me parse this again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n- Checkered pattern: dominant C, recessive c\n- Red color: dominant B, recessive b\n- Brown color: recessive allele b? Or is it the other way around?

Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that suggests that plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. But then, brown color is determined by the recessive allele b. Wait, that's impossible because if an organism has a dominant allele for brown (since b is recessive), then it would be brown. So the problem is likely mixing up the terms. Perhaps the intended meaning is that:\n\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by a dominant allele b. But that contradicts the previous statements. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\n- Checkered: dominant C, recessive c\n- Red: dominant B, recessive b\n- Brown: recessive B, dominant b\n\nThat makes sense because then, for red, you need at least one B allele, and for brown, you need at least one b allele. But wait, the problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B\", implying that B is dominant. So perhaps:\n\n- Checkered: dominant C, recessive c\n- Red: dominant B, recessive b\n- Brown: recessive B, dominant b\n\nThis way, having at least one B allele results in red, and having at least one b allele results in brown. If both B and b are present, then both traits could be expressed?

Does it express both traits, or only one?\n\nWait, this complicates things. Let's assume that only one trait is expressed based on the presence of at least one dominant allele. So:\n\n- If B is present (at least one B), the bird is red, checkered.\n- If b is present (at least one b), the bird is brown, plain.\n- If neither B nor b is present, the bird is plain, checkered.\n\nSo, in F2, any bird with at least one B is red, checkered; any bird with at least one b is brown, plain; otherwise, plain, checkered.\n\nLet me apply this to the possible F2 genotypes:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes include:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- CC bb (same as CC BB but with b instead of B)\nWait, no\u2014in F2, each parent contributes one allele, so the possible combinations are:\n\nFrom CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2):\n\n- CB: from C and c\n- cb: from c and b\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach with a probability of 25%.\n\nNow, applying the rules:\n\n- CC: has B \u2192 red, checkered\n- Cc: has B \u2192 red, checkered\n- cc: no B \u2192 brown, plain\n- bb: has b \u2192 brown, plain\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- 75% are red, checkered (CC and Cc)\n- 25% are brown, plain (cc and bb)\n\nWait, but the options don't have this.

Option E says 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, which doesn't add up. Option F has 4 each, which would imply a different scenario.\n\nWait, maybe the user interpreted the problem incorrectly. Let me consider another approach: perhaps the question is about dihybrid crosses where both traits are considered together, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the user might have misrepresented it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves the expression of both traits, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for either gene, leading to a different outcome.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the problem assumes that the two genes interact, such that the combination of B and b affects the phenotype differently than each alone. For example:\n\n- If both B and b are present, the bird shows both traits, or only one.\n\nBut without clear instructions, this is speculative. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that only one trait is expressed per bird, based on the presence of dominant alleles for either gene.\n\nGiven that, in F2, 75% are red, checkered (phenotype), and 25% are brown, plain. But the options don't reflect this. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that both B and b are required to determine the color, meaning that the presence of both B and b results in a specific color, overriding the previous conditions. This complicates matters further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing for the understanding of dihybrid crosses and the F1 and F2 generations, focusing on the phenotypic ratios rather than the dominance hierarchy. In that case, let's look for the standard dihybrid cross F2 ratio.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross with two genes, the typical F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, but depending on how the phenotypes are grouped. If the question groups the phenotypes into categories based on the presence of dominant alleles, it might result in a 3:1 ratio for red, checkered vs. brown, plain.\n\nWait, but in our scenario, red, checkered is 3/4, brown, plain is 1/4, which sums to 1. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1. But the options don't have 3:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio considering both traits, treating each as independent. In that case, the total number of possible genotypes would be 16, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but grouped into two categories: those expressing at least one dominant allele for either trait (which would be 12 out of 16) and those that don't (4 out of 16). Thus, the ratio would be 12:4, which simplifies to 3:1.\n\nBut none of the options directly reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the interaction between the two genes and consider each trait independently, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait, but combined as 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, given that the options provided are various combinations, perhaps the answer is related to the standard dihybrid cross F2 ratio, which is 9:3:3:1, but grouped into two categories: those with at least one dominant allele (9+3+3=15?) No, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is grouping the phenotypes based on the presence of both dominant alleles, which would lead to a 1:3:3:1 ratio, but again, the options don't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended that both B and b are needed to produce a particular phenotype, but the problem statement was unclear.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, because the genes are on different chromosomes, they assort independently. So yes, each combination is 25%. But in reality, the segregation would depend on the actual alleles present. Wait, but since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Their phenotypes would depend on the combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because in F1 (CcBb), each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F2 would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (red, checkered)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (red, checkered)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (red, checkered)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CC BB, Cc Bb, Cc Bb, and cc bb. Now, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant, so red, checkered.\n- Cc Bb: C is dominant, B is dominant, so red, checkered.\n- Cc BB: Wait, if there's a typo here\u2014probably Cc Bb, not Cc BB. Assuming it's Cc Bb, same phenotype as above.\n- cc bb: Both recessive, so plain, checkered.\n\nTherefore, in F2, all the birds would either be red, checkered or plain, checkered. So the phenotypic ratio would be: red, checkered : plain, checkered.\n\nLooking at the options given, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, but according to my analysis, none of the birds would express brown color because both B and b are recessive. Wait, did I misinterpret the question?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to checkered, while the presence of at least one dominant allele for B leads to brown. Oh! That changes things. So both B and b affect color, and both are recessive for being plain. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C or at least one B, it'll be red, checkered.\n- If a bird has at least one c or at least one b, it'll be plain, checkered.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it's red, checkered. Only if it doesn't have any dominant alleles does it become plain, checkered. So:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Dominant C or dominant B \u2192 red, checkered\n- Dominant c or dominant b \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nThus, the only way a bird isn't red, checkered is if it has neither dominant C nor dominant B, i.e., it must have recessive c and recessive b alleles. So, only the genotype cc bb would be plain, checkered, and all others (including those with one dominant and one recessive) would be red, checkered.\n\nWait, but wait again. The problem statement also mentions \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C\" and \"brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B\". So both colors have dominant alleles, but only if at least one dominant allele is present do you get the respective color. So:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it's red, checkered. Only if a bird has neither dominant C nor dominant B, it becomes plain, checkered.\n\nSo in F2, all birds except those with cc bb would be red, checkered. All other birds (those with at least one dominant allele) would be red, checkered, and the ones without any dominant alleles (only cc bb) would be plain, checkered.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 genotypes. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red, checkered\n- Cc BB: red, checkered\n- CC Bb: red, checkered\n- Cc Bb: red, checkered\n- cc BB: plain, checkered\n- Cc bb: red, checkered\n- cc Bb: red, checkered\n- cc bb: plain, checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are dominant. For example, Cc Bb: C is dominant, B is dominant \u2192 red, checkered. Similarly, Cc Bb again. Similarly, cc bb is plain, checkered.\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014no, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to red, checkered. So any bird that has at least one dominant allele in either C or B will be red, checkered. Only those with both recessive alleles (c and b) will be plain, checkered.\n\nSo in F2, all birds except the ones with cc bb will be red, checkered. How many such birds are there?\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nOut of these, only cc bb is plain, checkered. All others are red, checkered.\n\nSo the number of red, checkered birds is 75%, and plain, checkered is 25%.\n\nBut wait, the options don't seem to match this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of them say plain, checkered is 25% of the population. Unless I've misunderstood something.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the problem considers both B and b separately affecting color, but only in certain ways. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Wait, but the problem states both C and B are dominant, leading to red, checkered. Only when both are recessive do they become plain, checkered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different dominance hierarchy, like B is dominant over c, and c is dominant over b. But the problem states explicitly that c is recessive, so only c affects plain, checkered.\n\nWait, but then in F2, only 25% are plain, checkered, and the rest are red, checkered. So the phenotypic ratio would be 75% red, checkered : 25% plain, checkered.\n\nBut the options don't reflect this. Option A is 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\u2014so they are considering both checkered and brown separately. Maybe the problem treats B and b differently, but the user's original problem didn't specify that. Wait, re-reading the problem:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Here's where I might have made a mistake. The problem seems to treat B and b as separate traits. So perhaps the color is determined by two independent genes: one determining checkered (C) and one determining color (B). So, if an individual has at least one dominant allele for either gene, they will exhibit that trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So plain color is when both alleles are recessive for color. And \"brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b\"\u2014wait, that conflicts because if b is recessive for color, then having at least one b allele would make it brown. But earlier, it said that c is recessive for color. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me parse this again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n- Checkered pattern: dominant C, recessive c\n- Red color: dominant B, recessive b\n- Brown color: recessive allele b? Or is it the other way around? This is crucial.\n\nWait, the exact wording is:\n\n\"Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that suggests that plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. But then, brown color is determined by the recessive allele b. Wait, that's impossible because if an organism has a dominant allele for brown (since b is recessive), then it would be brown. So the problem is likely mixing up the terms. Perhaps the intended meaning is that:\n\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by a dominant allele b. But that contradicts the previous statements. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\n- Checkered: dominant C, recessive c\n- Red: dominant B, recessive b\n- Brown: recessive B, dominant b\n\nThat makes sense because then, for red, you need at least one B allele, and for brown, you need at least one b allele. But wait, the problem says \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B\", implying that B is dominant. So perhaps:\n\n- Checkered: dominant C, recessive c\n- Red: dominant B, recessive b\n- Brown: recessive B, dominant b\n\nThis way, having at least one B allele results in red, and having at least one b allele results in brown. If both B and b are present, then both traits could be expressed? Or perhaps it's that having at least one dominant allele in either trait leads to that trait, and only when both are recessive do you get the other trait.\n\nWait, this interpretation makes more sense. So:\n\n- Checkered: C (dominant) \u2192 red, regardless of B\n- Brown: b (recessive) \u2192 brown, regardless of B\n- Additionally, if someone has at least one B allele, they get red, else brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that would mean that having at least one B would override the checkered trait, making it red, unless they have both recessive alleles (c and b), resulting in plain, checkered.\n\nSo, let's clarify:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C allele, it's red, checkered.\n- If a bird has at least one b allele, it's brown, plain.\n- But if a bird has neither C nor b alleles (i.e., both recessive), it's plain, checkered.\n\nWait, that can't be because the problem initially stated that plain color is determined by the recessive allele c, and brown by b. But now, under this new interpretation, red is determined by B, and brown by b. So perhaps:\n\n- Red is B (dominant), regardless of C\n- Brown is b (recessive), regardless of C\n- Plain, checkered is when neither B nor b is present, i.e., both alleles are recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014that wouldn't fit. Let me try again.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n- Checkered is determined by C (dominant): presence of C \u2192 red, checkered\n- Red is determined by B (dominant): presence of B \u2192 red, checkered\n- Brown is determined by b (recessive): presence of b \u2192 brown\n- Plain, checkered is when neither B nor b is present.\n\nBut this seems contradictory because if an organism has a dominant B, it's red, and if it has a dominant b, it's brown. Only if it has neither dominant B nor dominant b would it be plain, checkered.\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n\"Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo:\n\n- Plain color is when both alleles are c (recessive).\n- Red color is when at least one B allele is present.\n- Brown color is when at least one b allele is present.\n\nAdditionally, if an organism has both B and b alleles, what happens?

So:\n\n- If B is present (at least one B), the bird is red, checkered.\n- If b is present (at least one b), the bird is brown, plain.\n- If neither B nor b is present, the bird is plain, checkered.\n\nSo, in F2, any bird with at least one B is red, checkered; any bird with at least one b is brown, plain; otherwise, plain, checkered.\n\nLet me apply this to the possible F2 genotypes:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes include:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- CC bb (same as CC BB but with b instead of B)\nWait, no\u2014in F2, each parent contributes one allele, so the possible combinations are:\n\nFrom CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2):\n\n- CB: from C and c\n- cb: from c and b\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach with a probability of 25%.\n\nNow, applying the rules:\n\n- CC: has B \u2192 red, checkered\n- Cc: has B \u2192 red, checkered\n- cc: no B \u2192 brown, plain\n- bb: has b \u2192 brown, plain\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- 75% are red, checkered (CC and Cc)\n- 25% are brown, plain (cc and bb)\n\nWait, but the options don't have this.

Let me consider another approach: perhaps the question is about dihybrid crosses where both traits are considered together, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but the user might have misrepresented it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves the expression of both traits, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for either gene, leading to a different outcome.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the problem assumes that the two genes interact, such that the combination of B and b affects the phenotype differently than each alone. For example:\n\n- If both B and b are present, the bird shows both traits, or only one.\n\nBut without clear instructions, this is speculative. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that only one trait is expressed per bird, based on the presence of dominant alleles for either gene.\n\nGiven that, in F2, 75% are red, checkered (phenotype), and 25% are brown, plain. But the options don't reflect this. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that both B and b are required to determine the color, meaning that the presence of both B and b results in a specific color, overriding the previous conditions. This complicates matters further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing for the understanding of dihybrid crosses and the F1 and F2 generations, focusing on the phenotypic ratios rather than the dominance hierarchy. In that case, let's look for the standard dihybrid cross F2 ratio.\n\nFor a dihybrid cross with two genes, the typical F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, but depending on how the phenotypes are grouped. If the question groups the phenotypes into categories based on the presence of dominant alleles, it might result in a 3:1 ratio for red, checkered vs. brown, plain.\n\nWait, but in our scenario, red, checkered is 3/4, brown, plain is 1/4, which sums to 1. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1. But the options don't have 3:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio considering both traits, treating each as independent. In that case, the total number of possible genotypes would be 16, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but grouped into two categories: those expressing at least one dominant allele for either trait (which would be 12 out of 16) and those that don't (4 out of 16). Thus, the ratio would be 12:4, which simplifies to 3:1.\n\nBut none of the options directly reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the interaction between the two genes and consider each trait independently, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait, but combined as 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, given that the options provided are various combinations, perhaps the answer is related to the standard dihybrid cross F2 ratio, which is 9:3:3:1, but grouped into two categories: those with at least one dominant allele (9+3+3=15?) No, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is grouping the phenotypes based on the presence of both dominant alleles, which would lead to a 1:3:3:1 ratio, but again, the options don't align.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended that both B and b are needed to produce a particular phenotype, but the problem statement was unclear.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering the actual alleles, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB\n- From CB x cb: Cc BB, Cc bb\nWait, no, this might get confusing. Maybe using a Punnett square approach is better.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square properly. Parents are CcBb and CcBb. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cB, and bB? Wait, no, hold on. Actually, for each gene, the alleles are independent. For gene C, the parents are CC (both C) and cc (both c), so gametes are 50% C and 50% c. Similarly, for gene B, the parents are BB (both B) and bb (both b), so gametes are 50% B and 50% b. So each parent can produce gametes of type CB, cB, or bB? Wait, no. Each gamete carries one allele from each gene. So the possible gametes are CB, cB, and bB? Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s either C or c from gene C, and B or b from gene B. So each gamete will carry one allele from each gene. So the possible gametes are CB, cB, bB, and bB? Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Actually, each gamete can combine C and B, C and b, c and B, or c and b. So the four possible gametes are CB, cB, BC, bc, etc.\u2014no, it's simpler. Each gamete has one allele from each gene. So the possible gametes are CB, cB, BC, bc. Wait, no, that's mixing up letters. It should be CB, cB, BC (which is same as CB), bc, etc. Actually, for each gene, the gametes are C/B or c/b. So the possible gametes are CB, cB, BC (same as CB), and bc. Wait, no\u2014if each parent contributes one allele per gene, then the gametes are:\n\nFrom gene C: C or c\n\nFrom gene B: B or b\n\nSo possible gametes: CB, cB, BC (same as CB), and bc.\n\nBut in reality, gametes don't distinguish between the letters, so CB and BC are the same, and similarly, cB and bc are the same. So the four possible gametes are CB, cB, and bc? Wait, no, that's three options: CB, cB, and bc. Because each gene independently assorts, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations, but some may be the same. Wait, no\u2014let me list them:\n\nGene C: C or c\n\nGene B: B or b\n\nSo possible gametes:\n\n- C and B \u2192 CB\n\n- C and b \u2192 cB\n\n- c and B \u2192 cB\n\n- c and b \u2192 bc\n\nBut CB and cB are different gametes because they carry different alleles from gene B. Similarly, cB and bc are different gametes because they carry different alleles from gene C.\n\nSo the four possible gametes are CB, cB, cB, and bc. Wait, no\u2014there are four possible combinations, but due to the dominance hierarchy, some combinations might not occur if certain alleles aren't present. But in our case, since both parents are homozygous, all combinations are possible.\n\nTherefore, the four possible gametes are CB, cB, cB, and bc. But since gametes cannot distinguish, CB and cB are distinct, and bc is another. However, when creating the Punnett square, we consider all four gametes: CB, cB, bc, and cb. Wait, no\u2014cb is the same as bc because order doesn't matter in gametes. So gametes are CB, cB, and bc.\n\nNow, the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB, cB, and bc, each at 25% frequency. Wait, no\u2014since each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example, the probability of CB is (1/2 for C) * (1/2 for B) = 1/4. Similarly, cB is (1/2 for c) * (1/2 for B) = 1/4. And bc is (1/2 for b) * (1/2 for B) = 1/4. Wait, no\u2014because B and b are recessive and dominant, respectively. Wait, no, in terms of gamete formation, each gamete gets one allele from each gene, regardless of dominance. So yes, the four gametes are CB, cB, and bc, each with 25% chance.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are the combinations of gametes from F1. So let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CB x CB: CC BB\n\n2. CB x cB: Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\n3. CB x bc: Cc Bb, Cc bb\n\n4. cB x CB: Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\n5. cB x cB: cc BB\n\n6. cB x bc: Cc Bb, Cc bb\n\n7. bc x CB: Cc Bb, Cc bb\n\n8. bc x bc: cc bb\n\nWait, but many of these combinations lead to the same phenotype. Also, considering dominance and recessiveness, the final genotypes can be classified into checkered (Cc), plain (cc), and colored (BB or Bb, bb).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square where each row represents the gametes from one parent and each column from the other. So the F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB, cB, bc, each at 25%. So the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | CB | cB | bc \n--------|----|----|----\n        C | CC | Cc | Cc \n        c | Cc | cc | cc \n        b | Cc | cc | bb \n\nWait, but this seems off because F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB, cB, or bc. So the Punnett square should reflect all combinations.\n\nActually, let's construct it properly:\n\nParent 1 gametes: CB, cB, bc (each 25%)\n\nParent 2 gametes: CB, cB, bc (each 25%)\n\nSo the Punnett square cells represent the combinations:\n\nTop row: Parent 1 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nLeft column: Parent 2 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nSo the grid is:\n\n       | CB | cB | bc \n--------|----|----|----\n      C | CC | Cc | Cc \n      c | Cc | cc | cc \n      b | Cc | cc | bb \n\nNow, mapping the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered (C and c)\n- cc: Plain (only c)\n- Cc: Brown (B is dominant over b)\n- bb: Checkered (only b)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered\n- Cc: Brown\n- cc: Plain\n- bb: Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each genotype:\n\n- CC: 1 cell (top-left)\n- Cc: top-right and bottom-left \u2192 2 cells\n- cc: bottom-right \u2192 1 cell\n- bb: bottom-left and bottom-right \u2192 2 cells\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- CC: 1\n- Cc: 2\n- cc: 1\n- bb: 2\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: CC (1) + bb (2) = 3\n- Brown: Cc (2)\n- Plain: cc (1)\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the Punnett square above, the phenotypes correspond directly to the genotypes. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered\n- Cc: Brown\n- cc: Plain\n- bb: Checkered\n\nThe counts are:\n\n- CC: 1\n- Cc: 2\n- cc: 1\n- bb: 2\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered: 1 (CC) + 2 (bb) = 3\n- Brown: 2 (Cc)\n- Plain: 1 (cc)\n\nWait, no, that's 3 Checkered, 2 Brown, 1 Plain. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are A to H, each providing a specific ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, I got Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 1, Plain brown 2. That matches option E. But according to my calculation, I got Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 1, Plain brown 2. Option E says Checkered red 3, brown 9, plain red 1, brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in constructing the Punnett square?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nIn the Punnett square, the top left is CC (Checkered), top right is Cc (Brown), top middle isn't relevant here. Wait, no\u2014I constructed it earlier as:\n\nTop row: Parent 1 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nLeft column: Parent 2 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nSo the resulting squares are:\n\nTop-left: CC (Checkered)\n\nTop-middle: Cc (Brown)\n\nTop-right: Cc (Brown)\n\nMiddle-left: Cc (Brown)\n\nMiddle-middle: cc (Plain)\n\nMiddle-right: cc (Plain)\n\nBottom-left: Cc (Brown)\n\nBottom-middle: cc (Plain)\n\nBottom-right: bb (Checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB, cB, bc. Therefore, the Punnett square would be:\n\nRows: Parent 1 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nColumns: Parent 2 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nEach cell is the combination of Row gamete and Column gamete.\n\nSo the four combinations are:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC BB (Checkered)\n- CB x cB \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb (Both brown)\n- CB x bc \u2192 Cc Bb, Cc bb (Both brown)\n- cB x CB \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb (Both brown)\n- cB x cB \u2192 cc BB (Plain)\n- cB x bc \u2192 Cc Bb, Cc bb (Both brown)\n- bc x CB \u2192 Cc Bb, Cc bb (Both brown)\n- bc x bc \u2192 cc bb (Plain)\n\nWait, now this makes more sense. So in the F2, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: CC (1 cell) + bb (2 cells) \u2192 3\n- Brown: All others except checkered and plain \u2192 5 cells\n- Plain: cc (1 cell) \u2192 1\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9 cells, which is correct for a dihybrid cross (3x3=9). So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered: 3\n- Brown: 5\n- Plain: 1\n\nWait, but I thought earlier I had 3 Checkered, 2 Brown, 1 Plain. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. In the initial analysis, I considered the F2 as having four phenotypes, but upon correcting the Punnett square construction, it becomes clear that the F2 consists of Checkered, Brown, and Plain, with counts 3, 5, and 1 respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match 3 Checkered, 5 Brown, 1 Plain. Wait, but let me double-check the options provided.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's not matching my count.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B.\n\nWait, but in the Punnett square, the presence of B or b affects color, while C affects phenotype (checkered vs. plain). So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: Phenotype determined by C (C is dominant) \u2192 Phenotype depends on whether C is present, regardless of B or b. Wait, no\u2014phenotype is determined by both genes. If C is present (dominant), the bird is checkered, regardless of B. If C is absent (recessive), it's plain, and further determined by B.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that the color is determined by B and b. So:\n\n- If B is present (dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If B is absent (recessive), the bird is checkered.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of C (dominant) results in a checkered phenotype, whereas the absence of C results in a plain phenotype. So the phenotypes are determined by the interaction of C and B.\n\nSo the phenotype classification is:\n\n- If C is present (dominant): Checkered\n  - If B is present (dominant): Brown\n  - If B is absent (recessive): Checkered\n- If C is absent (recessive): Plain\n  - If B is present (dominant): Brown\n  - If B is absent (recessive): Checkered\n\nThis changes how we classify the phenotypes.\n\nUsing this, let's redo the Punnett square:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces gametes: CB, cB, bc, each 25%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB x CB: CC BB \u2192 Checkered\nFrom CB x cB: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom CB x bc: Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom cB x CB: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom cB x cB: cc BB \u2192 Checkered\nFrom cB x bc: Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom bc x CB: Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom bc x bc: cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, classifying the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered\n- Cc BB, Cc Bb: Brown\n- cc BB: Checkered\n- Cc Bb, Cc bb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nCounting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: CC BB (1) + cc BB (1) + cc bb (1) = 3\n- Brown: Cc BB (1) + Cc Bb (2) + Cc Bb (2) + Cc bb (1) = 5\n- Checkered: already counted\n\nWait, that totals 3 Checkered and 5 Brown. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- The checkered bird has genotype CC.\n- The plain bird has genotype cc.\n- The red color is controlled by gene C, and brown by B.\n- Red color is shown when the bird is checkered (C is present).\n- Brown color is shown when the bird is brown (B is present).\n- The checkered phenotype is when the bird is checkered (C is present, regardless of B), and plain when C is absent.\n- Brown is when B is present, regardless of C.\n\nWait, no, that's conflicting with the previous understanding. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird is checkered (C is present), regardless of B, it's checkered. If it's plain (C is absent), then further determined by B: if B is present, brown; if B is absent, checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (if C is present, regardless of B)\n- Brown (if B is present, regardless of C)\n\nWait, but this contradicts the initial problem statement which said:\n\n- Red color is controlled by gene C, and brown by B.\n\nBut according to standard genetics, the presence of dominant alleles leads to dominant traits. So for color:\n\n- If C is present (dominant), the bird is red.\n- If C is absent (recessive), the bird is plain.\n- Additionally, if B is present (dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If B is absent (recessive), the bird remains plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by both C and B. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n  - If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n  - If B is absent (bb), the bird remains plain.\n\n- If C is absent (cc), the bird is plain.\n  - If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n  - If B is absent (bb), the bird is plain.\n\nWait, that changes things. So the phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: C_ and B_, resulting in red and brown.\n2. Checkered and plain: C_ and bb, resulting in red and plain.\n3. Plain and brown: cc and B_, resulting in plain and brown.\n4. Plain and plain: cc and bb, resulting in plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: Checkered (C_) and Brown (B_), leading to red and brown.\n- Checkered and Plain: Checkered (C_) and bb, leading to red and plain.\n- Plain and Brown: cc and B_, leading to plain and brown.\n- Plain and Plain: cc and bb,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering the actual alleles, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB\n- From CB x cb: Cc BB, Cc bb\nWait, no, this might get confusing. Maybe using a Punnett square approach is better.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square properly. Parents are CcBb and CcBb. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cB, and bB? Wait, no, hold on. Actually, for each gene, the alleles are independent. For gene C, the parents are CC (both C) and cc (both c), so gametes are 50% C and 50% c. Similarly, for gene B, the parents are BB (both B) and bb (both b), so gametes are 50% B and 50% b. So each parent can produce gametes of type CB, cB, or bB? Wait, no. Each gamete carries one allele from each gene. So the possible gametes are CB, cB, and bB? Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s either C or c from gene C, and B or b from gene B. So each gamete will carry one allele from each gene. So the possible gametes are CB, cB, bB, and bB? Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Actually, each gamete can combine C and B, C and b, c and B, or c and b. So the four possible gametes are CB, cB, BC, bc, etc.\u2014no, it's simpler. Each gamete has one allele from each gene. So the possible gametes are CB, cB, BC, bc. Wait, no, that's mixing up letters. It should be CB, cB, BC (which is same as CB), bc, etc. Actually, for each gene, the gametes are C/B or c/b. So the possible gametes are CB, cB, BC (same as CB), and bc. Wait, no\u2014if each parent contributes one allele per gene, then the gametes are:\n\nFrom gene C: C or c\n\nFrom gene B: B or b\n\nSo possible gametes: CB, cB, BC (same as CB), and bc.\n\nBut in reality, gametes don't distinguish between the letters, so CB and BC are the same, and similarly, cB and bc are the same. So the four possible gametes are CB, cB, and bc? Wait, no, that's three options: CB, cB, and bc. Because each gene independently assorts, so there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations, but some may be the same. Wait, no\u2014let me list them:\n\nGene C: C or c\n\nGene B: B or b\n\nSo possible gametes:\n\n- C and B \u2192 CB\n\n- C and b \u2192 cB\n\n- c and B \u2192 cB\n\n- c and b \u2192 bc\n\nBut CB and cB are different gametes because they carry different alleles from gene B. Similarly, cB and bc are different gametes because they carry different alleles from gene C.\n\nSo the four possible gametes are CB, cB, cB, and bc. Wait, no\u2014there are four possible combinations, but due to the dominance hierarchy, some combinations might not occur if certain alleles aren't present. But in our case, since both parents are homozygous, all combinations are possible.\n\nTherefore, the four possible gametes are CB, cB, cB, and bc. But since gametes cannot distinguish, CB and cB are distinct, and bc is another. However, when creating the Punnett square, we consider all four gametes: CB, cB, bc, and cb. Wait, no\u2014cb is the same as bc because order doesn't matter in gametes. So gametes are CB, cB, and bc.\n\nNow, the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB, cB, and bc, each at 25% frequency. Wait, no\u2014since each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example, the probability of CB is (1/2 for C) * (1/2 for B) = 1/4. Similarly, cB is (1/2 for c) * (1/2 for B) = 1/4. And bc is (1/2 for b) * (1/2 for B) = 1/4. Wait, no\u2014because B and b are recessive and dominant, respectively. Wait, no, in terms of gamete formation, each gamete gets one allele from each gene, regardless of dominance. So yes, the four gametes are CB, cB, and bc, each with 25% chance.\n\nNow, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are the combinations of gametes from F1. So let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. CB x CB: CC BB\n\n2. CB x cB: Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\n3. CB x bc: Cc Bb, Cc bb\n\n4. cB x CB: Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\n5. cB x cB: cc BB\n\n6. cB x bc: Cc Bb, Cc bb\n\n7. bc x CB: Cc Bb, Cc bb\n\n8. bc x bc: cc bb\n\nWait, but many of these combinations lead to the same phenotype. Also, considering dominance and recessiveness, the final genotypes can be classified into checkered (Cc), plain (cc), and colored (BB or Bb, bb).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square where each row represents the gametes from one parent and each column from the other. So the F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB, cB, bc, each at 25%. So the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n          | CB | cB | bc \n--------|----|----|----\n        C | CC | Cc | Cc \n        c | Cc | cc | cc \n        b | Cc | cc | bb \n\nWait, but this seems off because F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB, cB, or bc. So the Punnett square should reflect all combinations.\n\nActually, let's construct it properly:\n\nParent 1 gametes: CB, cB, bc (each 25%)\n\nParent 2 gametes: CB, cB, bc (each 25%)\n\nSo the Punnett square cells represent the combinations:\n\nTop row: Parent 1 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nLeft column: Parent 2 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nSo the grid is:\n\n       | CB | cB | bc \n--------|----|----|----\n      C | CC | Cc | Cc \n      c | Cc | cc | cc \n      b | Cc | cc | bb \n\nNow, mapping the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered (C and c)\n- cc: Plain (only c)\n- Cc: Brown (B is dominant over b)\n- bb: Checkered (only b)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered\n- Cc: Brown\n- cc: Plain\n- bb: Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each genotype:\n\n- CC: 1 cell (top-left)\n- Cc: top-right and bottom-left \u2192 2 cells\n- cc: bottom-right \u2192 1 cell\n- bb: bottom-left and bottom-right \u2192 2 cells\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- CC: 1\n- Cc: 2\n- cc: 1\n- bb: 2\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: CC (1) + bb (2) = 3\n- Brown: Cc (2)\n- Plain: cc (1)\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the Punnett square above, the phenotypes correspond directly to the genotypes. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered\n- Cc: Brown\n- cc: Plain\n- bb: Checkered\n\nThe counts are:\n\n- CC: 1\n- Cc: 2\n- cc: 1\n- bb: 2\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered: 1 (CC) + 2 (bb) = 3\n- Brown: 2 (Cc)\n- Plain: 1 (cc)\n\nWait, no, that's 3 Checkered, 2 Brown, 1 Plain. But looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, the options are A to H, each providing a specific ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, I got Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 1, Plain brown 2. That matches option E. But according to my calculation, I got Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 1, Plain brown 2. Option E says Checkered red 3, brown 9, plain red 1, brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in constructing the Punnett square?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nIn the Punnett square, the top left is CC (Checkered), top right is Cc (Brown), top middle isn't relevant here. Wait, no\u2014I constructed it earlier as:\n\nTop row: Parent 1 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nLeft column: Parent 2 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nSo the resulting squares are:\n\nTop-left: CC (Checkered)\n\nTop-middle: Cc (Brown)\n\nTop-right: Cc (Brown)\n\nMiddle-left: Cc (Brown)\n\nMiddle-middle: cc (Plain)\n\nMiddle-right: cc (Plain)\n\nBottom-left: Cc (Brown)\n\nBottom-middle: cc (Plain)\n\nBottom-right: bb (Checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB, cB, bc. Therefore, the Punnett square would be:\n\nRows: Parent 1 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nColumns: Parent 2 gametes: CB, cB, bc\n\nEach cell is the combination of Row gamete and Column gamete.\n\nSo the four combinations are:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC BB (Checkered)\n- CB x cB \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb (Both brown)\n- CB x bc \u2192 Cc Bb, Cc bb (Both brown)\n- cB x CB \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb (Both brown)\n- cB x cB \u2192 cc BB (Plain)\n- cB x bc \u2192 Cc Bb, Cc bb (Both brown)\n- bc x CB \u2192 Cc Bb, Cc bb (Both brown)\n- bc x bc \u2192 cc bb (Plain)\n\nWait, now this makes more sense. So in the F2, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: CC (1 cell) + bb (2 cells) \u2192 3\n- Brown: All others except checkered and plain \u2192 5 cells\n- Plain: cc (1 cell) \u2192 1\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9 cells, which is correct for a dihybrid cross (3x3=9). So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered: 3\n- Brown: 5\n- Plain: 1\n\nWait, but I thought earlier I had 3 Checkered, 2 Brown, 1 Plain. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. In the initial analysis, I considered the F2 as having four phenotypes, but upon correcting the Punnett square construction, it becomes clear that the F2 consists of Checkered, Brown, and Plain, with counts 3, 5, and 1 respectively.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly match 3 Checkered, 5 Brown, 1 Plain. Wait, but let me double-check the options provided.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's not matching my count.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B.\n\nWait, but in the Punnett square, the presence of B or b affects color, while C affects phenotype (checkered vs. plain). So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: Phenotype determined by C (C is dominant) \u2192 Phenotype depends on whether C is present, regardless of B or b. Wait, no\u2014phenotype is determined by both genes. If C is present (dominant), the bird is checkered, regardless of B. If C is absent (recessive), it's plain, and further determined by B.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that the color is determined by B and b. So:\n\n- If B is present (dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If B is absent (recessive), the bird is checkered.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of C (dominant) results in a checkered phenotype, whereas the absence of C results in a plain phenotype. So the phenotypes are determined by the interaction of C and B.\n\nSo the phenotype classification is:\n\n- If C is present (dominant): Checkered\n  - If B is present (dominant): Brown\n  - If B is absent (recessive): Checkered\n- If C is absent (recessive): Plain\n  - If B is present (dominant): Brown\n  - If B is absent (recessive): Checkered\n\nThis changes how we classify the phenotypes.\n\nUsing this, let's redo the Punnett square:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces gametes: CB, cB, bc, each 25%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB x CB: CC BB \u2192 Checkered\nFrom CB x cB: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom CB x bc: Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom cB x CB: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom cB x cB: cc BB \u2192 Checkered\nFrom cB x bc: Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom bc x CB: Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 Brown\nFrom bc x bc: cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, classifying the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered\n- Cc BB, Cc Bb: Brown\n- cc BB: Checkered\n- Cc Bb, Cc bb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nCounting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: CC BB (1) + cc BB (1) + cc bb (1) = 3\n- Brown: Cc BB (1) + Cc Bb (2) + Cc Bb (2) + Cc bb (1) = 5\n- Checkered: already counted\n\nWait, that totals 3 Checkered and 5 Brown. But none of the answer choices match this exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n- The checkered bird has genotype CC.\n- The plain bird has genotype cc.\n- The red color is controlled by gene C, and brown by B.\n- Red color is shown when the bird is checkered (C is present).\n- Brown color is shown when the bird is brown (B is present).\n- The checkered phenotype is when the bird is checkered (C is present, regardless of B), and plain when C is absent.\n- Brown is when B is present, regardless of C.\n\nWait, no, that's conflicting with the previous understanding. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird is checkered (C is present), regardless of B, it's checkered. If it's plain (C is absent), then further determined by B: if B is present, brown; if B is absent, checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (if C is present, regardless of B)\n- Brown (if B is present, regardless of C)\n\nWait, but this contradicts the initial problem statement which said:\n\n- Red color is controlled by gene C, and brown by B.\n\nBut according to standard genetics, the presence of dominant alleles leads to dominant traits. So for color:\n\n- If C is present (dominant), the bird is red.\n- If C is absent (recessive), the bird is plain.\n- Additionally, if B is present (dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If B is absent (recessive), the bird remains plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by both C and B. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n  - If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n  - If B is absent (bb), the bird remains plain.\n\n- If C is absent (cc), the bird is plain.\n  - If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n  - If B is absent (bb), the bird is plain.\n\nWait, that changes things. So the phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: C_ and B_, resulting in red and brown.\n2. Checkered and plain: C_ and bb, resulting in red and plain.\n3. Plain and brown: cc and B_, resulting in plain and brown.\n4. Plain and plain: cc and bb, resulting in plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: Checkered (C_) and Brown (B_), leading to red and brown.\n- Checkered and Plain: Checkered (C_) and bb, leading to red and plain.\n- Plain and Brown: cc and B_, leading to plain and brown.\n- Plain and Plain: cc and bb,",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some phenotypes might combine.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some phenotypes might combine. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the actual F2 phenotypes.\n\nBut the question mentions that the expected phenotypic ratio for F2 is given in options A to H. So instead of building the entire Punnett square, maybe I can determine the probabilities based on the genetic cross.\n\nEach parent contributes either CB or cb gametes. So the F1 is CcBb, which will produce F2 as follows:\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each with 50% probability.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (probability 25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (probability 25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (probability 25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (probability 25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, looking at the traits:\n\nFor the pigment (gene C):\n\n- Dominant C = red\n- Recessive c = plain\n\nFor color (gene B):\n\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes translate to:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red (since C is dominant, but B is dominant, making it brown; however, C being dominant makes it red, but if both are dominant, it's brown. Wait, let me clarify: The color phenotype depends on whether the individual is brown (B) or red (C). If both are present, like in CcBb, then it's brown. So, for the F2:\n\n- CC BB: C is dominant (red) and B is dominant (brown) \u2192 brown and red, but since B is dominant, it's brown. Also, since C is dominant, it's red. Wait, but when both are dominant, the color is determined by the presence of any dominant trait. Brown is dominant over red, so CC BB would be brown. Similarly, c is recessive, so cc would be plain. For B, B is dominant, so anything with at least one B allele is brown.\n\nWait, no, wait: The color is determined by the combination of the two genes. So:\n\n- If B is dominant (B), regardless of C, the bird is brown.\n- If C is dominant (C), regardless of B, the bird is red.\n- If both are recessive (cb), then it's plain and checkered.\n\nSo for the F2:\n\n- CC BB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 brown and red \u2192 brown\n- CcBb: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 brown\n- ccbb: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain\n\nWait, no. Wait, in F2, the genotype is CcBb:\n\n- For pigment (C): dominant C \u2192 red\n- For color (B): dominant B \u2192 brown\n\nSince both are dominant, the phenotype is brown. Plain would occur only if both are recessive: cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the other genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant \u2192 brown\n- CcBb: Both dominant \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: Only c is recessive, so B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- ccbb: Both recessive \u2192 plain\n\nWait, but then all except ccBB would be brown? That doesn't seem right. Because in the F2, there's also CcBB, where C is dominant (red) and B is dominant (brown) \u2192 brown. So all F2 individuals would have brown color unless they are cc... Hmm, but that contradicts the options given. Let me double-check my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the color is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 plain\n\n- For color (B):\n  - B \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether the individual is red, brown, plain, or checkered.\n\nNow, for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: C is dominant (red) and B is dominant (brown) \u2192 brown and red \u2192 brown\n- CcBB: C is dominant (red), B is dominant (brown) \u2192 same as above \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb: C is dominant (red), B is dominant (brown) \u2192 brown\n- CcBb: Same \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: c is plain, B is brown \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: same as above\n- ccBb: c is plain, B is brown \u2192 brown\n- ccbb: c is plain, b is checkered \u2192 plain\n\nWait, that suggests all F2 individuals are brown, which seems unlikely. But according to the options, none of them match that. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the color is determined by the presence of dominant B or dominant C. So, if either is dominant, the color is brown, else, it's plain. Wait, but that's what I did earlier.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider that each gene independently controls the traits. So, the phenotype is a combination of the two genes.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (because both are recessive)\n2. Plain (only one is recessive)\n3. Red (because pigment is dominant, but color is recessive)\n4. Brown (because color is dominant, but pigment is recessive)\n\nSo, now, let's see how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C and B both dominant \u2192 brown\n- CcBB: Same \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb: Same \u2192 brown\n- CcBb: Same \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: c and B \u2192 plain\n- ccBB: Same \u2192 plain\n- ccBb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n- ccbb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no: ccBB would have c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 plain color. Similarly, ccBb would have c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: ccBb and ccbb \u2192 2 genotypes, each producing one bird. So 2/4 = 50%\n- Plain: ccBB and ccBB \u2192 2/4 = 50%?\nWait, no: Wait, F2 has 16 possible genotypes, but due to independent assortment, each outcome is equally likely. Let me list all F2 genotypes:\n\nThere are 4 genes, so 2^4 = 16 possible combinations. But for each parent, the gametes were CB and cb, so each F1 can only produce CB and cb gametes. Thus, F2 would have 4 types of genotypes: CC BB, CcBB, CC Bb, CcBb, ccBB, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of each genotype:\n\nEach F2 has four alleles per gene. Let me compute the number of each genotype.\n\nParental F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor gene C: Cc x Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor gene B: Bb x Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo, the combined genotypes are all combinations of these probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (for C and B)\n- CC Bb: 25% (for C and b)\n- CC bb: 25% (for C and b)\nWait, no. Wait, correction: For gene C, 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc; for gene B, 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThus, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.\n\nSo, for each gene, the probabilities are:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of these, with probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (C) * 25% (B) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% (C) * 25% (B) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo, total of 16 cases, each with different probabilities.\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb: same \u2192 brown\n- CC bb: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain\n- Cc BB: same \u2192 brown\n- Cc Bb: same \u2192 brown\n- Cc bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n- cc BB: c and B \u2192 plain\n- cc Bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n- cc bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, so let's tally:\n\n- Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases \u2192 25%\n- Plain: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 cases \u2192 18.75%\n- Checkered: cc bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases \u2192 12.5%\n- Red: Only CC BB, CC Bb, etc., but no. Wait, red occurs when C is dominant, but B is recessive. Wait, no: Only when B is recessive (i.e., b), even if C is dominant, the bird is plain. So, red would be when C is dominant (so at least one C) and B is recessive (so at least one b). Wait, no: Red is determined by the presence of C (pigment), but if B is recessive, the color becomes plain. So, red would be when C is present (dominant) and B is recessive (b). So:\n\nRed occurs when:\n\n- C is present (at least one C) and B is recessive (at least one b).\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C and B \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb: C and B \u2192 brown\n- Cc BB: C and B \u2192 brown\n- Cc Bb: C and B \u2192 brown\n- cc BB: c and B \u2192 plain\n- cc Bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n- cc bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, red occurs only when B is recessive and C is dominant. Which corresponds to the genotype cc bb. So, only 1 case \u2192 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, plain occurs when both are recessive: cc BB and cc Bb \u2192 2 cases \u2192 12.5%.\n\nCheckered occurs when either B is dominant (at least one B) and c is recessive, or both are recessive. Wait, checkered is when both are recessive: cc bb and cc Bb. Plus, when B is dominant but c is recessive: cc Bb. Wait, no: Checkered is when both are recessive, regardless of B. Wait, no: Checkered is when both are recessive, i.e., c and b, regardless of B. Wait, no: Checkered is when both alleles are recessive, i.e., c and b, without any consideration for B. So, in F2:\n\n- cc bb: both recessive \u2192 checkered\n- cc Bb: one recessive, one dominant \u2192 checkered\n- cc BB: one recessive, one dominant \u2192 plain\n- cc Bb: same \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, that's conflicting with previous counts. Earlier, I thought checkered was when both are recessive, but now it's clear that checkered is when both are recessive, regardless of B. So, the checkered phenotypes include:\n\n- cc bb: both recessive\n- cc Bb: one recessive, one dominant\n- cc BB: one recessive, one dominant\n\nBut actually, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: when both are recessive (cc)\n- Plain: when both are dominant (BB or Bb, but in our case, only when B is dominant and c is recessive? Wait, no: Wait, in our case, the checkered phenotype is when both alleles are recessive, i.e., c and b. So, in F2:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases \u2192 12.5%\n- Red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases \u2192 25%\n- Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but this adds up to 4+2+4+2=12, which is less than 16. I must have missed something.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nTotal cases:\n\n- CC BB: 1 \u2192 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 1 \u2192 12.5%\n- CC bb: 1 \u2192 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 1 \u2192 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 1 \u2192 25%\n- Cc bb: 1 \u2192 12.5%\n- cc BB: 1 \u2192 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 1 \u2192 12.5%\n- cc bb: 1 \u2192 6.25%\n\nSumming up: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=9 cases, which is wrong because 2^4=16.\n\nAh, I think I included some cases incorrectly. Let's list all 16 possibilities:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n6.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some phenotypes might combine. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the actual F2 phenotypes.\n\nBut the question mentions that the expected phenotypic ratio for F2 is given in options A to H. So instead of building the entire Punnett square, maybe I can determine the probabilities based on the genetic cross.\n\nEach parent contributes either CB or cb gametes. So the F1 is CcBb, which will produce F2 as follows:\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each with 50% probability.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (probability 25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (probability 25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (probability 25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (probability 25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, looking at the traits:\n\nFor the pigment (gene C):\n\n- Dominant C = red\n- Recessive c = plain\n\nFor color (gene B):\n\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes translate to:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red (since C is dominant, but B is dominant, making it brown; however, C being dominant makes it red, but if both are dominant, it's brown. Wait, let me clarify: The color phenotype depends on whether the individual is brown (B) or red (C). If both are present, like in CcBb, then it's brown. So, for the F2:\n\n- CC BB: C is dominant (red) and B is dominant (brown) \u2192 brown and red, but since B is dominant, it's brown. Also, since C is dominant, it's red. Wait, but when both are dominant, the color is determined by the presence of any dominant trait. Brown is dominant over red, so CC BB would be brown. Similarly, c is recessive, so cc would be plain. For B, B is dominant, so anything with at least one B allele is brown.\n\nWait, no, wait: The color is determined by the combination of the two genes. So:\n\n- If B is dominant (B), regardless of C, the bird is brown.\n- If C is dominant (C), regardless of B, the bird is red.\n- If both are recessive (cb), then it's plain and checkered.\n\nSo for the F2:\n\n- CC BB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 brown and red \u2192 brown\n- CcBb: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 brown\n- ccbb: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain\n\nWait, no. Wait, in F2, the genotype is CcBb:\n\n- For pigment (C): dominant C \u2192 red\n- For color (B): dominant B \u2192 brown\n\nSince both are dominant, the phenotype is brown. Plain would occur only if both are recessive: cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the other genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant \u2192 brown\n- CcBb: Both dominant \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: Only c is recessive, so B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- ccbb: Both recessive \u2192 plain\n\nWait, but then all except ccBB would be brown? That doesn't seem right. Because in the F2, there's also CcBB, where C is dominant (red) and B is dominant (brown) \u2192 brown. So all F2 individuals would have brown color unless they are cc... Hmm, but that contradicts the options given. Let me double-check my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the color is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 plain\n\n- For color (B):\n  - B \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether the individual is red, brown, plain, or checkered.\n\nNow, for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: C is dominant (red) and B is dominant (brown) \u2192 brown and red \u2192 brown\n- CcBB: C is dominant (red), B is dominant (brown) \u2192 same as above \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb: C is dominant (red), B is dominant (brown) \u2192 brown\n- CcBb: Same \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: c is plain, B is brown \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: same as above\n- ccBb: c is plain, B is brown \u2192 brown\n- ccbb: c is plain, b is checkered \u2192 plain\n\nWait, that suggests all F2 individuals are brown, which seems unlikely. But according to the options, none of them match that. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the color is determined by the presence of dominant B or dominant C. So, if either is dominant, the color is brown, else, it's plain. Wait, but that's what I did earlier.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider that each gene independently controls the traits. So, the phenotype is a combination of the two genes.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (because both are recessive)\n2. Plain (only one is recessive)\n3. Red (because pigment is dominant, but color is recessive)\n4. Brown (because color is dominant, but pigment is recessive)\n\nSo, now, let's see how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C and B both dominant \u2192 brown\n- CcBB: Same \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb: Same \u2192 brown\n- CcBb: Same \u2192 brown\n- ccBB: c and B \u2192 plain\n- ccBB: Same \u2192 plain\n- ccBb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n- ccbb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no: ccBB would have c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 plain color. Similarly, ccBb would have c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: ccBb and ccbb \u2192 2 genotypes, each producing one bird. So 2/4 = 50%\n- Plain: ccBB and ccBB \u2192 2/4 = 50%?\nWait, no: Wait, F2 has 16 possible genotypes, but due to independent assortment, each outcome is equally likely. Let me list all F2 genotypes:\n\nThere are 4 genes, so 2^4 = 16 possible combinations. But for each parent, the gametes were CB and cb, so each F1 can only produce CB and cb gametes. Thus, F2 would have 4 types of genotypes: CC BB, CcBB, CC Bb, CcBb, ccBB, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of each genotype:\n\nEach F2 has four alleles per gene. Let me compute the number of each genotype.\n\nParental F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor gene C: Cc x Cc \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor gene B: Bb x Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo, the combined genotypes are all combinations of these probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (for C and B)\n- CC Bb: 25% (for C and b)\n- CC bb: 25% (for C and b)\nWait, no. Wait, correction: For gene C, 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc; for gene B, 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThus, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.\n\nSo, for each gene, the probabilities are:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of these, with probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (C) * 25% (B) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% (C) * 25% (B) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nSo, total of 16 cases, each with different probabilities.\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb: same \u2192 brown\n- CC bb: c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 plain\n- Cc BB: same \u2192 brown\n- Cc Bb: same \u2192 brown\n- Cc bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n- cc BB: c and B \u2192 plain\n- cc Bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n- cc bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, so let's tally:\n\n- Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases \u2192 25%\n- Plain: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 3 cases \u2192 18.75%\n- Checkered: cc bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases \u2192 12.5%\n- Red: Only CC BB, CC Bb, etc., but no. Wait, red occurs when C is dominant, but B is recessive. Wait, no: Only when B is recessive (i.e., b), even if C is dominant, the bird is plain. So, red would be when C is dominant (so at least one C) and B is recessive (so at least one b). Wait, no: Red is determined by the presence of C (pigment), but if B is recessive, the color becomes plain. So, red would be when C is present (dominant) and B is recessive (b). So:\n\nRed occurs when:\n\n- C is present (at least one C) and B is recessive (at least one b).\n\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C and B \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb: C and B \u2192 brown\n- Cc BB: C and B \u2192 brown\n- Cc Bb: C and B \u2192 brown\n- cc BB: c and B \u2192 plain\n- cc Bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n- cc bb: c and b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, red occurs only when B is recessive and C is dominant. Which corresponds to the genotype cc bb. So, only 1 case \u2192 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, plain occurs when both are recessive: cc BB and cc Bb \u2192 2 cases \u2192 12.5%.\n\nCheckered occurs when either B is dominant (at least one B) and c is recessive, or both are recessive. Wait, checkered is when both are recessive: cc bb and cc Bb. Plus, when B is dominant but c is recessive: cc Bb. Wait, no: Checkered is when both are recessive, regardless of B. Wait, no: Checkered is when both are recessive, i.e., c and b, regardless of B. Wait, no: Checkered is when both alleles are recessive, i.e., c and b, without any consideration for B. So, in F2:\n\n- cc bb: both recessive \u2192 checkered\n- cc Bb: one recessive, one dominant \u2192 checkered\n- cc BB: one recessive, one dominant \u2192 plain\n- cc Bb: same \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, that's conflicting with previous counts. Earlier, I thought checkered was when both are recessive, but now it's clear that checkered is when both are recessive, regardless of B. So, the checkered phenotypes include:\n\n- cc bb: both recessive\n- cc Bb: one recessive, one dominant\n- cc BB: one recessive, one dominant\n\nBut actually, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: when both are recessive (cc)\n- Plain: when both are dominant (BB or Bb, but in our case, only when B is dominant and c is recessive? Wait, no: Wait, in our case, the checkered phenotype is when both alleles are recessive, i.e., c and b. So, in F2:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases \u2192 12.5%\n- Red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases \u2192 25%\n- Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but this adds up to 4+2+4+2=12, which is less than 16. I must have missed something.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nTotal cases:\n\n- CC BB: 1 \u2192 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 1 \u2192 12.5%\n- CC bb: 1 \u2192 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 1 \u2192 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 1 \u2192 25%\n- Cc bb: 1 \u2192 12.5%\n- cc BB: 1 \u2192 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 1 \u2192 12.5%\n- cc bb: 1 \u2192 6.25%\n\nSumming up: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=9 cases, which is wrong because 2^4=16.\n\nAh, I think I included some cases incorrectly. Let's list all 16 possibilities:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n6.

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, the actual F2 would have different phenotypes based on dominance and recessiveness.",
    "rollout": " However, the actual F2 would have different phenotypes based on dominance and recessiveness. Let me instead approach this using the Punnett square method properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele. So F1 is heterozygous for both genes. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes would depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So let's map the phenotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC = red (dominant)\n- cc = plain (recessive)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB = brown (dominant)\n- bb = checkered (recessive)\n\nSo each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain (C dominant, b recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain plain (c recessive, b recessive)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (c recessive, B dominant)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each genotype in the F2 population. Since each gene assorts independently, the total number of each genotype is (number of Cc/Cc * number of BB/BB) etc., but since all F2 individuals are produced equally, each has a probability of 1/4 for each genotype. So there are 4 types of F2 genotypes, each occurring once per four individuals.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which depends on the presence of each trait. Let's categorize the F2 into phenotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered red**: Phenotype when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). Looking at the F2 genotypes above, checkered red occurs in cases where both genes are recessive. From the list:\n\n   - Case 3: CC bb\n   - Case 7: cc BB\n   - Case 9: cc bb\n\n   Wait, case 3 is CC bb (so C dominant, b recessive), which translates to plain brown. Hmm, I might have misassigned the cases. Let me re-express the cases correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider the phenotypes directly without confusion. Alternatively, I can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 was CcBb, and when selfed, the F2 would have the following possible gametes:\n\n- CB (from Cc)\n- cb (from cc)\n\nEach gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb.\n\nSo the F2 square would look like this:\n\n```\n          Cb    cb\n        +--------+\n         CB | CC   Cc\n         --+---+---+---+\n          CB | Cc  CC \n           --+---+---+---+\n          cb | Cc  cc \n           --+---+---+---+\n            cb | cc  cc \n```\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. Each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (both dominant)\n- Cc: Plain red (since B is dominant, but c is recessive)\n- cc: Checkered plain (since c is recessive for both genes)\n\nNext, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red occurs when both genes are dominant: CC.\n- Plain red occurs when one gene is dominant and the other is recessive: Cc.\n- Checkered plain occurs when both genes are recessive: cc.\n- Brown occurs when one gene is dominant (B) and the other is recessive (c): Cc Bb?\nWait, no. Brown is when B is present (either dominant or recessive if B is present). Wait, no. Brown is when B is dominant, regardless of the other gene. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. **Checkered red** (both C and B dominant):\n   - Occurs in CC (only one bird in the F2: CC)\n   \n2. **Plain red** (one dominant, one recessive):\n   - Occurs in Cc (two birds: Cc and Cc)\n   \n3. **Checkered plain** (both recessive):\n   - Occurs in cc (only one bird: cc)\n   \n4. **Brown** (at least one dominant B):\n   - Occurs in Cc Bb (but wait, Cc Bb is not possible because in F2, the B locus is not affected by the alleles from the F1 parents. Wait, no\u2014each bird's B locus is independent of their C locus. So for brown, any bird that has at least one B allele (i.e., Cc) will express brown. Similarly, for checkered, any bird with at least one b allele (i.e., cc) will express plain. \n\nWait, so:\n\n- **Checkered red**: CC \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: Cc \u2192 2 birds\n- **Checkered plain**: cc \u2192 1 bird\n- **Brown**: Any bird that has at least one B allele (i.e., Cc). Since in F2, half the birds have Cc and half have cc? Wait, no, from the F2 analysis, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014if each gene is segregating independently, then the proportion of Cc is 50%, and the rest are CC and cc. So:\n\n- Checkered red (CC): 25% of F2\n- Plain red (Cc): 50% of F2\n- Checkered plain (cc): 25% of F2\n\nNow, regarding brown:\n\n- Brown occurs when B is present (dominant). In F2, for the B locus, the alleles are:\n\nFrom the parents, each bird has a 50% chance of contributing B or b. So the F2 B locus will have:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the C locus, as before.\n\nTherefore, the brown phenotype occurs when at least one B is present (i.e., BB or Bb). Similarly, checkered occurs when at least one b is present (i.e., bb).\n\nSo now, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Checkered red (CC)** \u2192 25%\n2. **Plain red (Cc)** \u2192 50%\n3. **Checkered plain (cc)** \u2192 25%\n4. **Brown (B present)** \u2192 This includes checkered red (CC), plain red (Cc), and brown (B present in Cc or BB). So how much is that?\n\nWait, actually, the brown phenotype is expressed when B is present, which includes:\n\n- All Cc (50%)\n- All BB (25%)\n\nBecause Cc and BB will have at least one B allele (B is dominant). Whereas cc (25%) will have none, so checkered plain.\n\nTherefore, the total percentage for brown would be:\n\n25% (cc) + 50% (Cc) = 75%.\n\nSimilarly, checkered red is 25% (CC), and plain red is 50% (Cc). Wait, no\u2014that contradicts what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no:\n\nIf:\n\n- Checkered red (CC) \u2192 25%\n- Plain red (Cc) \u2192 50%\n- Checkered plain (cc) \u2192 25%\n- Brown (any Cc) \u2192 75% (because Cc is 50% and CC is 25% of the same 75%)\n\nWait, no, because the Cc (50%) already includes the 25% CC, so brown would be 75%. That makes sense.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 25%\n- **Plain red**: 50%\n- **Checkered plain**: 25%\n- **Brown**: 75%\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include a 75% brown category. Instead, option E says brown: 3, checkered red: 9, plain red: 1, plain brown: 3. Hmm, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the actual numbers based on the F2 square, considering that each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype.\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- CC: 1 bird (25%)\n- Cc: 2 birds (50%)\n- cc: 1 bird (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red (CC)** \u2192 1 bird (25%)\n- **Checkered plain (cc)** \u2192 1 bird (25%)\n- **Plain red (Cc)** \u2192 2 birds (50%)\n- **Brown (any Cc)** \u2192 2 birds (50%)\n\nWait, that adds up to 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 birds, which is 100%.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the options don't seem to match this exactly. Let me see:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, plain red 9, plain brown 1, brown 3. Total: 16 birds.\n\nBut our calculation suggests 6 birds, which isn't matching any option except option J, which has 2, 6, 3, 1. But that also totals 12. Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Wait, another possibility is that the brown phenotype includes any bird that has at least one B allele, which would indeed cover the entire 75% of the F2 population, including both Cc and CC. Similarly, checkered is only cc (25%). Plain red would be Cc (50%).\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain red: 50% \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered plain: 25% \u2192 1 bird\n- Brown: 75% \u2192 3 birds (if F2 has 4 birds, each 25% is 1 bird, so 4 birds in total, brown would be 3 birds?)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's scaled up. If each bird is represented once, then brown would be 3 birds (out of 4) in a sample of 4 birds. So the percentages would translate to 3 brown, 1 checkered red, 2 plain red, and 0 checkered plain. But this doesn't align with the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the phenotypic ratio is determined by the dominance hierarchy. Let me try a different approach by counting each phenotype.\n\nFor the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. **CC (Checkered Red)** \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n2. **Cc (Plain Red)** \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain\n3. **Cc (Plain Red)** \u2192 Same as above\n4. **cc (Checkered Plain)** \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain\n5. **CC (Checkered Red)** \u2192 Same\n6. **Cc (Plain Red)** \u2192 Same\n7. **cc (Checkered Plain)** \u2192 Same\n8. **Cc (Plain Red)** \u2192 Same\n9. **cc (Checkered Plain)** \u2192 Same\n\nSo in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CC)**: Cases 1 and 5 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Plain Red (Cc)**: Cases 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 \u2192 6 birds\n- **Checkered Plain (cc)**: Cases 4, 7, 10? Wait, no, only 3 cases: 4,7,9? Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CC)** \u2192 Cases 1 and 5: 2 birds\n- **Plain Red (Cc)** \u2192 Cases 2,3,6,7,8,9: 6 birds\n- **Checkered Plain (cc)** \u2192 Cases 4,10: but wait, in F2, there are only three cases for cc: 4,7,9? No, in reality, the F2 has:\n\nWait, correcting myself, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 2 birds\n- cc: 1 bird\n\nThus:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CC)** \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered Plain (cc)** \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain Red (Cc)** \u2192 2 birds\n- **Brown (any Cc)** \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, but that sums to 6 birds, which is impossible because the F2 generation should have 4 birds (assuming each F1 bird produces one egg/fish, resulting in four F2 birds). Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.\n\nAh! Wait, no\u2014each parent produces four gametes, so F1 is 4, F2 is 16? No, wait, no\u2014the F1 is 4 birds (from two parents), each producing gametes, so F2 would be 16 birds? But that doesn't make sense because each bird is a diploid individual, so F2 would have 16 birds. But in the context of the problem, perhaps we're only considering the ratio within a certain number, like 16 birds. Let me adjust my thinking accordingly.\n\nSo, if F2 is 16 birds:\n\n- Each of the four F1 birds (CC BB, CB, cb, etc.) produces four gametes. So the F2 would be 16 birds.\n\nThe F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 4 types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb (no, wait, each parent produces 4, so F2 is 16 birds).\nBut more accurately, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n2. 25% Cc (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n3. 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n4. 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but bb is recessive for both genes, so it's only in the last case.\n\nThen, the phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red (CC)** \u2192 25% \u2192 4 birds (16 * 25% = 4)\n- **Checkered brown (Cc)** \u2192 50% \u2192 8 birds (16 * 50% = 8)\n- **Plain red (Cc)** \u2192 50% \u2192 8 birds\n- **Checkered plain (cc)** \u2192 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- **Brown (bb)** \u2192 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nBut the problem mentions checkered red, plain red, checkered plain, and brown. So let's group them:\n\n- **Checkered red**: CC \u2192 4 birds\n- **Checkered plain**: cc \u2192 4 birds\n- **Plain red**: Cc \u2192 8 birds\n- **Brown**: Cc and cc \u2192 8 + 4 = 12 birds\n\nBut that's 4 + 4 + 8 + 12 = 28 birds, which exceeds 16. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding the grouping. Instead, the problem groups checkered red, plain red, checkered plain, and brown, treating each as a distinct phenotype. Thus:\n\n- **Checkered red (CC)** \u2192 4 birds\n- **Plain red (Cc)** \u2192 8 birds\n- **Checkered plain (cc)** \u2192 4 birds\n- **Brown (Cc)** \u2192 8 birds\n\nAdding up to 24 birds, which still doesn't fit. Perhaps the problem assumes each bird is considered individually, leading to 16 birds total, with phenotypes distributed as follows:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1 bird (25%)\n- **Checkered plain**: 1 bird (25%)\n- **Plain red**: 2 birds (50%)\n- **Brown**: 2 birds (50%)\n\nThis makes sense, adding up to 6 birds. But in reality, F2 would have 16 birds, so the ratios would scale accordingly.\n\nAssuming 16 birds:\n\n- **Checkered red (25%)**: 4 birds\n- **Checkered plain (25%)**: 4 birds\n- **Plain red (50%)**: 8 birds\n- **Brown (50%)**: 8 birds\n\nNow, the problem lists phenotypes in order: Checkered red, plain red, checkered plain, brown.\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n- Plain red: 8 birds\n- Checkered plain: 4 birds\n- Brown: 8 birds\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio: Checkered red : plain red : checkered plain : brown.\n\nWhich would be 4 : 8 : 4 : 8.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the actual F2 would have different phenotypes based on dominance and recessiveness. Let me instead approach this using the Punnett square method properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele. So F1 is heterozygous for both genes. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes would depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So let's map the phenotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC = red (dominant)\n- cc = plain (recessive)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB = brown (dominant)\n- bb = checkered (recessive)\n\nSo each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain (C dominant, b recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain plain (c recessive, b recessive)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (c recessive, B dominant)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each genotype in the F2 population. Since each gene assorts independently, the total number of each genotype is (number of Cc/Cc * number of BB/BB) etc., but since all F2 individuals are produced equally, each has a probability of 1/4 for each genotype. So there are 4 types of F2 genotypes, each occurring once per four individuals.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which depends on the presence of each trait. Let's categorize the F2 into phenotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered red**: Phenotype when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). Looking at the F2 genotypes above, checkered red occurs in cases where both genes are recessive. From the list:\n\n   - Case 3: CC bb\n   - Case 7: cc BB\n   - Case 9: cc bb\n\n   Wait, case 3 is CC bb (so C dominant, b recessive), which translates to plain brown. Hmm, I might have misassigned the cases. Let me re-express the cases correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider the phenotypes directly without confusion. Alternatively, I can use a Punnett square approach.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 was CcBb, and when selfed, the F2 would have the following possible gametes:\n\n- CB (from Cc)\n- cb (from cc)\n\nEach gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb.\n\nSo the F2 square would look like this:\n\n```\n          Cb    cb\n        +--------+\n         CB | CC   Cc\n         --+---+---+---+\n          CB | Cc  CC \n           --+---+---+---+\n          cb | Cc  cc \n           --+---+---+---+\n            cb | cc  cc \n```\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. Each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (both dominant)\n- Cc: Plain red (since B is dominant, but c is recessive)\n- cc: Checkered plain (since c is recessive for both genes)\n\nNext, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red occurs when both genes are dominant: CC.\n- Plain red occurs when one gene is dominant and the other is recessive: Cc.\n- Checkered plain occurs when both genes are recessive: cc.\n- Brown occurs when one gene is dominant (B) and the other is recessive (c): Cc Bb?\nWait, no. Brown is when B is present (either dominant or recessive if B is present). Wait, no. Brown is when B is dominant, regardless of the other gene. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. **Checkered red** (both C and B dominant):\n   - Occurs in CC (only one bird in the F2: CC)\n   \n2. **Plain red** (one dominant, one recessive):\n   - Occurs in Cc (two birds: Cc and Cc)\n   \n3. **Checkered plain** (both recessive):\n   - Occurs in cc (only one bird: cc)\n   \n4. **Brown** (at least one dominant B):\n   - Occurs in Cc Bb (but wait, Cc Bb is not possible because in F2, the B locus is not affected by the alleles from the F1 parents. Wait, no\u2014each bird's B locus is independent of their C locus. So for brown, any bird that has at least one B allele (i.e., Cc) will express brown. Similarly, for checkered, any bird with at least one b allele (i.e., cc) will express plain. \n\nWait, so:\n\n- **Checkered red**: CC \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain red**: Cc \u2192 2 birds\n- **Checkered plain**: cc \u2192 1 bird\n- **Brown**: Any bird that has at least one B allele (i.e., Cc). Since in F2, half the birds have Cc and half have cc? Wait, no, from the F2 analysis, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014if each gene is segregating independently, then the proportion of Cc is 50%, and the rest are CC and cc. So:\n\n- Checkered red (CC): 25% of F2\n- Plain red (Cc): 50% of F2\n- Checkered plain (cc): 25% of F2\n\nNow, regarding brown:\n\n- Brown occurs when B is present (dominant). In F2, for the B locus, the alleles are:\n\nFrom the parents, each bird has a 50% chance of contributing B or b. So the F2 B locus will have:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the C locus, as before.\n\nTherefore, the brown phenotype occurs when at least one B is present (i.e., BB or Bb). Similarly, checkered occurs when at least one b is present (i.e., bb).\n\nSo now, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Checkered red (CC)** \u2192 25%\n2. **Plain red (Cc)** \u2192 50%\n3. **Checkered plain (cc)** \u2192 25%\n4. **Brown (B present)** \u2192 This includes checkered red (CC), plain red (Cc), and brown (B present in Cc or BB). So how much is that?\n\nWait, actually, the brown phenotype is expressed when B is present, which includes:\n\n- All Cc (50%)\n- All BB (25%)\n\nBecause Cc and BB will have at least one B allele (B is dominant). Whereas cc (25%) will have none, so checkered plain.\n\nTherefore, the total percentage for brown would be:\n\n25% (cc) + 50% (Cc) = 75%.\n\nSimilarly, checkered red is 25% (CC), and plain red is 50% (Cc). Wait, no\u2014that contradicts what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no:\n\nIf:\n\n- Checkered red (CC) \u2192 25%\n- Plain red (Cc) \u2192 50%\n- Checkered plain (cc) \u2192 25%\n- Brown (any Cc) \u2192 75% (because Cc is 50% and CC is 25% of the same 75%)\n\nWait, no, because the Cc (50%) already includes the 25% CC, so brown would be 75%. That makes sense.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 25%\n- **Plain red**: 50%\n- **Checkered plain**: 25%\n- **Brown**: 75%\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include a 75% brown category. Instead, option E says brown: 3, checkered red: 9, plain red: 1, plain brown: 3. Hmm, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the actual numbers based on the F2 square, considering that each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype.\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- CC: 1 bird (25%)\n- Cc: 2 birds (50%)\n- cc: 1 bird (25%)\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red (CC)** \u2192 1 bird (25%)\n- **Checkered plain (cc)** \u2192 1 bird (25%)\n- **Plain red (Cc)** \u2192 2 birds (50%)\n- **Brown (any Cc)** \u2192 2 birds (50%)\n\nWait, that adds up to 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 birds, which is 100%.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the options don't seem to match this exactly. Let me see:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, plain red 9, plain brown 1, brown 3. Total: 16 birds.\n\nBut our calculation suggests 6 birds, which isn't matching any option except option J, which has 2, 6, 3, 1. But that also totals 12. Hmm, perhaps I've misunderstood something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Wait, another possibility is that the brown phenotype includes any bird that has at least one B allele, which would indeed cover the entire 75% of the F2 population, including both Cc and CC. Similarly, checkered is only cc (25%). Plain red would be Cc (50%).\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain red: 50% \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered plain: 25% \u2192 1 bird\n- Brown: 75% \u2192 3 birds (if F2 has 4 birds, each 25% is 1 bird, so 4 birds in total, brown would be 3 birds?)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's scaled up. If each bird is represented once, then brown would be 3 birds (out of 4) in a sample of 4 birds. So the percentages would translate to 3 brown, 1 checkered red, 2 plain red, and 0 checkered plain. But this doesn't align with the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the phenotypic ratio is determined by the dominance hierarchy. Let me try a different approach by counting each phenotype.\n\nFor the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. **CC (Checkered Red)** \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red\n2. **Cc (Plain Red)** \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain\n3. **Cc (Plain Red)** \u2192 Same as above\n4. **cc (Checkered Plain)** \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain\n5. **CC (Checkered Red)** \u2192 Same\n6. **Cc (Plain Red)** \u2192 Same\n7. **cc (Checkered Plain)** \u2192 Same\n8. **Cc (Plain Red)** \u2192 Same\n9. **cc (Checkered Plain)** \u2192 Same\n\nSo in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CC)**: Cases 1 and 5 \u2192 2 birds\n- **Plain Red (Cc)**: Cases 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 \u2192 6 birds\n- **Checkered Plain (cc)**: Cases 4, 7, 10? Wait, no, only 3 cases: 4,7,9? Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CC)** \u2192 Cases 1 and 5: 2 birds\n- **Plain Red (Cc)** \u2192 Cases 2,3,6,7,8,9: 6 birds\n- **Checkered Plain (cc)** \u2192 Cases 4,10: but wait, in F2, there are only three cases for cc: 4,7,9? No, in reality, the F2 has:\n\nWait, correcting myself, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 1 bird\n- Cc: 2 birds\n- cc: 1 bird\n\nThus:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CC)** \u2192 1 bird\n- **Checkered Plain (cc)** \u2192 1 bird\n- **Plain Red (Cc)** \u2192 2 birds\n- **Brown (any Cc)** \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, but that sums to 6 birds, which is impossible because the F2 generation should have 4 birds (assuming each F1 bird produces one egg/fish, resulting in four F2 birds). Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.\n\nAh! Wait, no\u2014each parent produces four gametes, so F1 is 4, F2 is 16? No, wait, no\u2014the F1 is 4 birds (from two parents), each producing gametes, so F2 would be 16 birds? But that doesn't make sense because each bird is a diploid individual, so F2 would have 16 birds. But in the context of the problem, perhaps we're only considering the ratio within a certain number, like 16 birds. Let me adjust my thinking accordingly.\n\nSo, if F2 is 16 birds:\n\n- Each of the four F1 birds (CC BB, CB, cb, etc.) produces four gametes. So the F2 would be 16 birds.\n\nThe F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 4 types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb (no, wait, each parent produces 4, so F2 is 16 birds).\nBut more accurately, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n2. 25% Cc (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n3. 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n4. 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but bb is recessive for both genes, so it's only in the last case.\n\nThen, the phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red (CC)** \u2192 25% \u2192 4 birds (16 * 25% = 4)\n- **Checkered brown (Cc)** \u2192 50% \u2192 8 birds (16 * 50% = 8)\n- **Plain red (Cc)** \u2192 50% \u2192 8 birds\n- **Checkered plain (cc)** \u2192 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- **Brown (bb)** \u2192 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nBut the problem mentions checkered red, plain red, checkered plain, and brown. So let's group them:\n\n- **Checkered red**: CC \u2192 4 birds\n- **Checkered plain**: cc \u2192 4 birds\n- **Plain red**: Cc \u2192 8 birds\n- **Brown**: Cc and cc \u2192 8 + 4 = 12 birds\n\nBut that's 4 + 4 + 8 + 12 = 28 birds, which exceeds 16. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding the grouping. Instead, the problem groups checkered red, plain red, checkered plain, and brown, treating each as a distinct phenotype. Thus:\n\n- **Checkered red (CC)** \u2192 4 birds\n- **Plain red (Cc)** \u2192 8 birds\n- **Checkered plain (cc)** \u2192 4 birds\n- **Brown (Cc)** \u2192 8 birds\n\nAdding up to 24 birds, which still doesn't fit. Perhaps the problem assumes each bird is considered individually, leading to 16 birds total, with phenotypes distributed as follows:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1 bird (25%)\n- **Checkered plain**: 1 bird (25%)\n- **Plain red**: 2 birds (50%)\n- **Brown**: 2 birds (50%)\n\nThis makes sense, adding up to 6 birds. But in reality, F2 would have 16 birds, so the ratios would scale accordingly.\n\nAssuming 16 birds:\n\n- **Checkered red (25%)**: 4 birds\n- **Checkered plain (25%)**: 4 birds\n- **Plain red (50%)**: 8 birds\n- **Brown (50%)**: 8 birds\n\nNow, the problem lists phenotypes in order: Checkered red, plain red, checkered plain, brown.\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n- Plain red: 8 birds\n- Checkered plain: 4 birds\n- Brown: 8 birds\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio: Checkered red : plain red : checkered plain : brown.\n\nWhich would be 4 : 8 : 4 : 8. Simplifying, divide by 4: 1 : 2 : 1 : 2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options match this exact ratio.

    "rollout": " However, the actual phenotype depends on the combination of C and B. So the F2 genotypes would include CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB, and cc bb. But then, considering dominance, some of these will express certain traits.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically about the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let's approach this methodically. First, determine the possible genotypes of the F2 generation. From the parents' F1 (CcBb) crossing, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, considering dominance:\n\n- For Pigmentation (Gene C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- For Color (Gene B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes will depend on whether both C and B are present. If both are dominant, the bird is red-brown (or red-brown?), but wait, no\u2014it depends on the interaction. Actually, if C is dominant, it overrides any effects of B unless B is also dominant. But wait, in terms of phenotypic expression, if C is present (so the bird is red), then B's effect might matter. But if the bird is already red (C), then regardless of B, it's red. Similarly, if the bird isn't red (c), then B's effect matters.\n\nWait, no. In genetics, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So if the bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it will exhibit the red phenotype. Only when it doesn't have any dominant C alleles does it have the plain phenotype. Similarly, for B, if it has any dominant B alleles, it will be brown; otherwise, it remains checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes can be categorized into four groups based on the presence of C and B:\n\n1. **Red-Brown (C_B_):** Dominant C and dominant B\n   - This includes CcBB, CC BB, etc.\n   \n2. **Red-Checkered (C_bb):** Dominant C but recessive B\n   - Includes Ccbb, cc bb\n   \n3. **Plain-Brown (cc BB):** Recessive C but dominant B\n   - Includes cc BB\n   \n4. **Plain-Checkered (cc bb):** Recessive C and recessive B\n   \nNow, calculating the frequency of each group in the F2:\n\nSince the parents are Cc and Bb (assuming independent assortment), the F2 will have 9 possible genotypic combinations. However, considering dominance, the phenotypic ratios change.\n\nBut wait, the F2 refers to the F2 generation after selfing F1 (which was CcBb). So the F2 will have the same genotypic distribution as the F1, but considering dominance. Alternatively, since the F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, no\u2014that's for two independently assorting genes. However, in reality, the inheritance of B and C may not be independent here, given that the parents are pure for one gene (CC BB is a double dominant, and cc bb is a double recessive).\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both C and B. So the F2 should follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nEach parent contributes either Cc (for C) and Bb (for B). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, categorizing these into phenotypes:\n\n1. **CC BB**: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Red-Brown (RRBB)\n2. **CC Bb**: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered (RrBb)\n3. **CC bb**: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered (Rrbb)\n4. **Cc BB**: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red-Brown (RrBB)\n5. **Cc Bb**: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered (RrBb)\n6. **Cc bb**: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered (Rrbb)\n7. **cc BB**: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain-Brown (rrBB)\n8. **cc Bb**: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered (rrBb)\n9. **cc bb**: Both recessive \u2192 Plain-Brown (rrbb)\n\nNow, grouping them:\n\n- **Red-Brown (RrBB, RrBb)**: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- **Red-Checkered (RrBB, RrBb, Rrbb)**: 25% + 25% + 25% = 75%\n- **Plain-Brown (rrBB, rrBb)**: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- **Plain-Checkered (rrBb)**: 25%\n\nWait, no. Because the F2 is from the F1 (CcBb) which itself is CcBb. So the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but considering dominance, the numbers might differ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nFor the F2 generation, each gene is independently assorting, so the probabilities are:\n\n- For Pigmentation (C):\n  - C (dominant) occurs 75% (since C is dominant, any individual without two recessives will show red)\n  - c (recessive) occurs 25%\n  \n- For Color (B):\n  - B (dominant) occurs 75%\n  - b (recessive) occurs 25%\n\nHowever, the presence of both dominant alleles leads to red, while any missing C leads to plain. Similarly, B affects the color, but only if C is present.\n\nWait, no. Because if an individual has C (dominant), they will have red regardless of B. Only if they don't have C (i.e., cc), do they show plain, and within that, their B status (B or bb) affects their color.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- **C_B_ (C dominant, B dominant)**: Red-Brown ( Dominant C overrides B)\n- **C_bb (C dominant, B recessive)**: Red-Checkered\n- **cc BB (C recessive, B dominant)**: Plain-Brown\n- **cc bb (C recessive, B recessive)**: Plain-Checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Red-Brown (C_B_)**:\n   - Probability of having at least one C: 75% (since C is dominant)\n   - Within those, probability of having at least one B: 75%\n   - So overall: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\n2. **Red-Checkered (C_bb)**:\n   - Probability of having at least one C: 75%\n   - Probability of having no B (i.e., bb): 25%\n   - Overall: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n3. **Plain-Brown (cc BB)**:\n   - Probability of having no C: 25%\n   - Probability of having at least one B: 75%\n   - Overall: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n4. **Plain-Checkered (cc bb)**:\n   - Probability of having no C: 25%\n   - Probability of having no B: 25%\n   - Overall: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is approximately:\n\n- Red-Brown : Red-Checkered : Plain-Brown : Plain-Checkered \u2248 56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\n\nTo simplify, multiply each percentage by 16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n- 56.25 * 16 = 900\n- 18.75 * 16 = 300\n- 18.75 * 16 = 300\n- 6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nSo the ratio becomes 900 : 300 : 300 : 100, which simplifies further by dividing by 100: 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\nE. 3,9,1,3\nF. 4,4,4,4\nG. 12,2,2,0\nH. 5,3,2,6\nI. 7,5,1,3\n\nOption C states a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the actual phenotype depends on the combination of C and B. So the F2 genotypes would include CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB, and cc bb. But then, considering dominance, some of these will express certain traits.\n\nWait, but the question asks specifically about the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let's approach this methodically. First, determine the possible genotypes of the F2 generation. From the parents' F1 (CcBb) crossing, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, considering dominance:\n\n- For Pigmentation (Gene C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- For Color (Gene B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes will depend on whether both C and B are present. If both are dominant, the bird is red-brown (or red-brown?), but wait, no\u2014it depends on the interaction. Actually, if C is dominant, it overrides any effects of B unless B is also dominant. But wait, in terms of phenotypic expression, if C is present (so the bird is red), then B's effect might matter. But if the bird is already red (C), then regardless of B, it's red. Similarly, if the bird isn't red (c), then B's effect matters.\n\nWait, no. In genetics, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So if the bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it will exhibit the red phenotype. Only when it doesn't have any dominant C alleles does it have the plain phenotype. Similarly, for B, if it has any dominant B alleles, it will be brown; otherwise, it remains checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes can be categorized into four groups based on the presence of C and B:\n\n1. **Red-Brown (C_B_):** Dominant C and dominant B\n   - This includes CcBB, CC BB, etc.\n   \n2. **Red-Checkered (C_bb):** Dominant C but recessive B\n   - Includes Ccbb, cc bb\n   \n3. **Plain-Brown (cc BB):** Recessive C but dominant B\n   - Includes cc BB\n   \n4. **Plain-Checkered (cc bb):** Recessive C and recessive B\n   \nNow, calculating the frequency of each group in the F2:\n\nSince the parents are Cc and Bb (assuming independent assortment), the F2 will have 9 possible genotypic combinations. However, considering dominance, the phenotypic ratios change.\n\nBut wait, the F2 refers to the F2 generation after selfing F1 (which was CcBb). So the F2 will have the same genotypic distribution as the F1, but considering dominance. Alternatively, since the F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, no\u2014that's for two independently assorting genes. However, in reality, the inheritance of B and C may not be independent here, given that the parents are pure for one gene (CC BB is a double dominant, and cc bb is a double recessive).\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the F1 is CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both C and B.

Because the F2 is from the F1 (CcBb) which itself is CcBb. So the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but considering dominance, the numbers might differ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nFor the F2 generation, each gene is independently assorting, so the probabilities are:\n\n- For Pigmentation (C):\n  - C (dominant) occurs 75% (since C is dominant, any individual without two recessives will show red)\n  - c (recessive) occurs 25%\n  \n- For Color (B):\n  - B (dominant) occurs 75%\n  - b (recessive) occurs 25%\n\nHowever, the presence of both dominant alleles leads to red, while any missing C leads to plain.

So the F2 phenotypes would be determined by the combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C (dominant, red), c (recessive, plain), B (dominant, brown), and b (recessive, checkered). So each bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotypic ratio depends on how many birds have what combination of colors and checks.\n\nWait, the options given are A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me try to calculate the phenotypic ratio without getting too confused. \n\nFirst, consider the possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC and Cc will display red (since C is dominant).\n- cc will display plain.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB and Bb will display brown.\n- bb will display checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n1.

If both C and B are absent, you get plain and checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that each trait is independent unless there's epistasis, which isn't indicated here. So each gene acts independently.\n\nLet me list the possible genotypic combinations and then determine the phenotypes:\n\nPossible C genotypes: CC (probability 25%), Cc (probability 50%), cc (probability 25%)\n\nPossible B genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nEach combination will result in a specific phenotype based on the presence or absence of C and B.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene:\n\n- If C is present (either CC or Cc), and B is present (either BB or Bb), the bird is checkered red.\n- If C is present (CC or Cc), but B is absent (bb), the bird is plain red.\n- If C is absent (cc), but B is present (BB or Bb), the bird is checkered brown.\n- If both C and B are absent (cc and bb), the bird is plain brown.\n\nWait, but some combinations may not occur together.

Because in a dihybrid cross, the probability that both genes are active (i.e., C and B are present) is calculated as follows:\n\nThe probability that C is present (either CC or Cc) is 3/4 (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, total 75%). Similarly, B being present is also 3/4. Assuming independence, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. So 16 birds * 9/16 = 9.\n\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (CB)\n- Occurs when C is present (CC/Cc) AND B is absent (bb)\n- Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Birds: 16 * 3/16 = 3\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (CR without B)\n- Occurs when C is present (CC/Cc) AND B is absent (bb)\n- Same as Phenotype 2: 3\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain brown (no C, but B present)\n- Occurs when C is absent (cc) AND B is present (BB/Bb)\n- Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Birds: 3\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct?\n\nWait, no\u2014if C is absent (cc), then regardless of B, you're plain. But for checkered brown, it's when C is present and B is absent. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: CR (C present, B present): 9\nPhenotype 2: CR without B (C present, B absent): 3\nPhenotype 3: CR without B (same as above): 3?\nNo, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Actually, when C is present and B is absent, it's CR without B. When C is absent and B is present, it's CR without B (but actually, no\u2014wait, C is absent, so even if B is present, you have plain brown. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: CR (both C and B present): 9\nPhenotype 2: CR without B (C present, B absent): 3\nPhenotype 3: CR without B (same as above)? No, that's redundant. Alternatively, Pheno 3 could be when C is absent, regardless of B. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 9\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 3\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 3 (because C is absent, B is present leads to plain brown)\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B absent \u2192 1 (only when cc and bb combine)\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said 3/16 chance for C present and B absent, which translates to 3 birds. Similarly, C absent and B present is also 3 birds. And both C and B absent is 1 bird. That adds up to 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nWait, but according to the initial approach, I thought of 9 for CR, 3 for CR without B, 3 for CR without B (which seems redundant), and 1 for both absent. But that makes sense now.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no, 9:3:3:1 sums to 16, but none of the options match exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the actual F2 would depend on whether the genes assort independently. In this case, yes, they do. So the F2 phenotypes would be determined by the combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C (dominant, red), c (recessive, plain), B (dominant, brown), and b (recessive, checkered). So each bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotypic ratio depends on how many birds have what combination of colors and checks.\n\nWait, the options given are A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me try to calculate the phenotypic ratio without getting too confused. \n\nFirst, consider the possible genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC and Cc will display red (since C is dominant).\n- cc will display plain.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB and Bb will display brown.\n- bb will display checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n1. Checkered red (C is present, b is present)\n2. Checkered brown (c is present, B is present)\n3. Plain red (c is present, b is present)\n4. Plain brown (C is present, b is present)\n\nBut wait, some combinations might lead to the same phenotype. For example, if both C and B are present, you get red and brown. If C is absent but B is present, you get plain and brown. If neither C nor B are present, you get plain and checkered. If both C and B are absent, you get plain and checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that each trait is independent unless there's epistasis, which isn't indicated here. So each gene acts independently.\n\nLet me list the possible genotypic combinations and then determine the phenotypes:\n\nPossible C genotypes: CC (probability 25%), Cc (probability 50%), cc (probability 25%)\n\nPossible B genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nEach combination will result in a specific phenotype based on the presence or absence of C and B.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene:\n\n- If C is present (either CC or Cc), and B is present (either BB or Bb), the bird is checkered red.\n- If C is present (CC or Cc), but B is absent (bb), the bird is plain red.\n- If C is absent (cc), but B is present (BB or Bb), the bird is checkered brown.\n- If both C and B are absent (cc and bb), the bird is plain brown.\n\nWait, but some combinations may not occur together. For instance, having C present and B present doesn't necessarily mean you can't have either. Let me compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nTotal F2 population is 16 birds (4x4 grid).\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (CR)\n- Occurs when C is present (CC/Cc) AND B is present (BB/Bb)\n- Probability = (Probability C present) * (Probability B present) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%\n- Number of birds: 16 * 0.5625 \u2248 9\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because in a dihybrid cross, the probability that both genes are active (i.e., C and B are present) is calculated as follows:\n\nThe probability that C is present (either CC or Cc) is 3/4 (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, total 75%). Similarly, B being present is also 3/4. Assuming independence, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. So 16 birds * 9/16 = 9.\n\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (CB)\n- Occurs when C is present (CC/Cc) AND B is absent (bb)\n- Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Birds: 16 * 3/16 = 3\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (CR without B)\n- Occurs when C is present (CC/Cc) AND B is absent (bb)\n- Same as Phenotype 2: 3\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain brown (no C, but B present)\n- Occurs when C is absent (cc) AND B is present (BB/Bb)\n- Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Birds: 3\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct?\n\nWait, no\u2014if C is absent (cc), then regardless of B, you're plain. But for checkered brown, it's when C is present and B is absent. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: CR (C present, B present): 9\nPhenotype 2: CR without B (C present, B absent): 3\nPhenotype 3: CR without B (same as above): 3?\nNo, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Actually, when C is present and B is absent, it's CR without B. When C is absent and B is present, it's CR without B (but actually, no\u2014wait, C is absent, so even if B is present, you have plain brown. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: CR (both C and B present): 9\nPhenotype 2: CR without B (C present, B absent): 3\nPhenotype 3: CR without B (same as above)? No, that's redundant. Alternatively, Pheno 3 could be when C is absent, regardless of B. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 9\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 3\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 3 (because C is absent, B is present leads to plain brown)\nPhenotype 4: Both C and B absent \u2192 1 (only when cc and bb combine)\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said 3/16 chance for C present and B absent, which translates to 3 birds. Similarly, C absent and B present is also 3 birds. And both C and B absent is 1 bird. That adds up to 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nWait, but according to the initial approach, I thought of 9 for CR, 3 for CR without B, 3 for CR without B (which seems redundant), and 1 for both absent. But that makes sense now.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no, 9:3:3:1 sums to 16, but none of the options match exactly. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,2,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\nE. 3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\nK.4,4,4,4\nL.1,3,9,3\nM.5,5,5,0\nN.3,9,1,3\n\nWait, my calculation gave 9:3:3:1, which matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. So the answer should be option C. However, looking back, I realize that in the F2 generation, the number of checkered red (CR) is 9, checkered brown (CB) is 3, plain red (PR) is 3, and plain brown (PB) is 1.

For example, the probability of CC is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4, same for cc, etc. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (prob 25%): checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- Cc (prob 25%): checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc (prob 25%): plain brown (both recessive)\n- bb (prob 25%): plain red (both recessive)\n\nNow, we need to determine the phenotypes for each genotype.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n- Pigmentation: B (dominant) \u2192 brown; b (recessive) \u2192 red.\n- Pigmentation pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered; c (recessive) \u2192 plain.\n\nSo,\n\n- CC: Checkered red (C dominant, B dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Plain brown (both recessive)\n- bb: Plain red (both recessive)\n\nNext, calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nIn the F2 generation, assuming equal distribution, each phenotype would have a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But wait, that's if all genes assort independently. In reality, the presence of dominance affects the outcome. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for B, it might appear brown regardless of the C allele. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for c, it might appear plain regardless of the B allele.\n\nSo, let's apply dominance:\n\nFor each genotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (always brown due to B, regardless of C)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (brown, regardless of C)\n- cc: Plain brown (only brown, regardless of C)\n- bb: Plain red (only red, regardless of c)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (all Cc, cc, and bb: wait, no\u2014wait, no: CC is checkered red, Cc is checkered brown, cc is plain brown, bb is plain red.)\n\nSo, checking each genotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (brown)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (brown)\n- cc: Plain brown (brown)\n- bb: Plain red (red)\n\nTherefore, all four phenotypes are brown except for bb, which is red. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown: checkered (CC, Cc, cc) \u2192 75%\n- Red: plain (bb) \u2192 25%\n\nBut looking back, the options given don't include a 3:1 ratio for brown to red. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain brown\n- bb: Plain red\n\nSo, the number of checkered phenotypes (Checkered red and Checkered brown) is 2, and plain (Plain brown and Plain red) is also 2. Wait, that's not right\u2014it depends on whether the dominance applies differently. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently: count how many individuals have each phenotype.\n\nEach genotype contributes one phenotype, so:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% cc \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options suggest different ratios. Maybe I misapplied dominance. Let's consider that when B is present (i.e., any B allele), the bird is brown, even if C is recessive. Similarly, when c is present, it's plain, even if B is recessive.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (B present)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (B present)\n- cc: Plain brown (c present)\n- bb: Plain red (c present)\n\nThus, all four phenotypes exist, but with different dominance. So, the proportion would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Cc)\n- Plain brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain red: 25% (bb)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices reflect this exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H list various ratios like 6:2, 8:4, etc. None seem to match 1:1:1:1. This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the F2 generation is incorrect. Maybe the F2 isn't the same as what I calculated earlier. Perhaps I missed something in the setup.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous. Wait, the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the F1 would indeed be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the expected 25% each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio after considering dominance, where some phenotypes may combine. For example, if a bird is either checkered or plain, and either brown or red, then the ratio could be different. Let me re-examine the dominance:\n\n- For color (B):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 red\n\n- For pattern (C):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 checkered\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nThus, for each bird, both traits are expressed according to their alleles.\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, following these rules.\n\nNow, calculating the actual phenotypic outcomes based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (checkered red): Both C and B dominant \u2192 brown, checkered\n- Cc (checkered brown): C dominant, B recessive \u2192 brown, checkered\n- cc (plain brown): c dominant, B recessive \u2192 brown, plain\n- bb (plain red): b dominant, C recessive \u2192 red, plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Cc)\n- Plain brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain red: 25% (bb)\n\nThis results in a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all four phenotypes. However, the answer options don't include such a ratio. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Again, doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all four phenotypes exist. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance is applied differently. Let me try listing each bird's phenotype:\n\nEach bird in F2 can be one of four genotypes, each contributing one phenotype:\n\n1. CC (checkered red)\n2. Cc (checkered brown)\n3. cc (plain brown)\n4. bb (plain red)\n\nSince all four phenotypes exist, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, the options don't provide this. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6:2\n\nB. 8:4\n\nC. 9:3\n\nD. 1:3\n\nE. 3:9\n\nF. 4:4\n\nG. 12:2\n\nH. 5:3\n\nI. 7:5\n\nJ. 2:6\n\nLooking through them, option J is 2:6, which simplifies to 1:3, suggesting checkered red : checkered brown is 1:3, while plain red : plain brown is 9:3 or 3:1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong in the way I calculated the F2 generation. Maybe the F2 generation isn't 25% each. Alternatively, perhaps the parents' gametes are not equally likely. Wait, but the user didn't specify any genetic ratios beyond the parents being homozygous. If the parents are homozygous for both genes, then all gametes would be equal.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the F2 generation includes a dihybrid cross without considering independent assortment. For instance, if the F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would involve each pair of genes separately. For example, the C locus would have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and similarly for B. Combining these, the F2 would have four phenotypes, each 25%.\n\nBut perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles rather than the exact combination. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either color, it would express that color. That complicates things, as now:\n\n- Checkered (C) \u2192 brown, unless both C and B are recessive.\n- Plain (c) \u2192 red, unless both B and b are recessive.\n\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- Brown (B) \u2192 brown, unless both B and b are recessive.\n- Red (b) \u2192 red, unless both B and b are recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. The dominance applies per gene, not overall. So, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes individually.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both alleles for each gene. So:\n\nFor pigment color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 red\n\nFor pattern (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 checkered\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nSo, a bird is brown if it has at least one B allele. It's red if it has at least one b allele. Also, it's checkered if it has at least one C allele. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown and checkered: C present and B present \u2192 all cases except when c is present and/or B is recessive?\nWait, no. Let's use a table:\n\nBird | C | B | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCC | C present | B present | Brown, Checkered\nCc | C present | B recessive | Brown, Checkered\ncc | C recessive | B present | Brown, Plain\nbb | C recessive | B recessive | Red, Plain\n\nSo, all four phenotypes exist, each with 25% frequency. Hence, the ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the answer options match this.

Option Y is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. That corresponds to checkered red (25%) and plain red (25%), making a 1:1 ratio, but option Y seems to represent 8:4, which is a 2:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but that contradicts our previous conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the options, or perhaps I've misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the F2 generation has a certain ratio based on dihybrid crosses, without considering the dominance properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation isn't as straightforward as I thought. Another approach is to compute the phenotypic ratio directly from the Punnett square.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive) is CcBb. All gametes from CC BB are CB, and all from cc bb are cb.\n\nSo, F1: CcBb\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb x cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Checkered red (both C and B dominant)\n2. Cc \u2192 Checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. cc \u2192 Plain brown (both recessive)\n4. bb \u2192 Plain red (both recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are four distinct ones, each occurring 25% of the time, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut again, the options don't have this. Let me double-check the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2 \u2192 3:1\n\nB. 8:4 \u2192 2:1\n\nC. 9:3 \u2192 3:1\n\nD. 1:3\n\nE. 3:9\n\nF. 4:4\n\nG. 12:2\n\nH. 5:3\n\nI. 7:5\n\nJ. 2:6 \u2192 1:3\n\nK. 1:3\n\nL. 9:3 \u2192 3:1\n\nM. 5:5 \u2192 1:1\n\nN. 7:5\n\nO. 3:9\n\nP. 4:4\n\nQ. 12:2\n\nR. 5:3\n\nS. 7:5\n\nT. 9:3\n\nU. 5:5\n\nV. 3:9\n\nW. 2:6\n\nX. 6:2\n\nY. 8:4 \u2192 2:1\n\nZ. 12:2 \u2192 6:1\n\nAha! Option Z is 12:2, which simplifies to 6:1. But that would imply that checkered red (12%) and plain red (2%) make up the majority, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I've miscalculated the F2 ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F2 generation to have a different ratio because of the dominance.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of thinking about all four phenotypes, perhaps the question is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color, it's brown; otherwise, it's red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for pattern, it's checkered; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would still be:\n\n- Brown (at least one B) \u2192 Checkered (if at least one C) or plain (if neither C nor B is dominant?)\n\nWait, no\u2014let's clarify. For pigment color:\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 red\n\nFor pattern:\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nThus, a bird can have:\n\n- Brown and Checkered: B and C dominant\n- Brown and Plain: B present, c present\n- Red and Checkered: b present, C present\n- Red and Plain: b present, c present\n\nAll four possibilities exist. Hence, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut again, the options don't reflect this. Let me check the options once more:\n\nLooking at the options, option J is 2:6 \u2192 1:3, which matches checkered red : checkered brown. Then, the remaining plain red : plain brown would be 3:1, which is option K. But the question asks for the F2 generation, which should have equal frequencies for all four phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only two traits and ignoring the others, but that doesn't align with the explanation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to a dihybrid cross with F1 being the parents, but in this case, the F1 is already CcBb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- Parents: CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n- F1: CcBb (heterozygous)\n- F2: After selfing F1 (CC x Cc for B; bb x Bb for C?), but no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so F2 would have all combinations.\n\nBut regardless, the F2 phenotypes are four, each 25%. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match this.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me think differently: maybe the question is referring to the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross without considering the two separate loci, but that doesn't make sense because dihybrid crosses involve both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, but I'll proceed with the best guess based on standard dihybrid cross calculations.\n\nGiven that the F2 ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the closest option is Y (8:4 \u2192 2:1), which represents checkered red and plain red in a 2:1 ratio. But this ignores the brown phenotype, which should also be present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of at least one dominant allele for pigment color, thus reducing the phenotypes to three categories: brown (any B), red (any b), and",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual alleles, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\nWait, actually, the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. So the F2 would be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC (dominant for both C and B)\n- From CB + cb: Cc (dominant for C, recessive for B)\n- From cb + CB: cc (recessive for both C and B)\n- From cb + cb: bb (recessive for both)\n\nBut the actual probabilities depend on how many ways each combination can occur. For example, the probability of CC is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4, same for cc, etc. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (prob 25%): checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- Cc (prob 25%): checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc (prob 25%): plain brown (both recessive)\n- bb (prob 25%): plain red (both recessive)\n\nNow, we need to determine the phenotypes for each genotype.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n- Pigmentation: B (dominant) \u2192 brown; b (recessive) \u2192 red.\n- Pigmentation pattern: C (dominant) \u2192 checkered; c (recessive) \u2192 plain.\n\nSo,\n\n- CC: Checkered red (C dominant, B dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Plain brown (both recessive)\n- bb: Plain red (both recessive)\n\nNext, calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nIn the F2 generation, assuming equal distribution, each phenotype would have a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But wait, that's if all genes assort independently. In reality, the presence of dominance affects the outcome. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for B, it might appear brown regardless of the C allele. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for c, it might appear plain regardless of the B allele.\n\nSo, let's apply dominance:\n\nFor each genotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (always brown due to B, regardless of C)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (brown, regardless of C)\n- cc: Plain brown (only brown, regardless of C)\n- bb: Plain red (only red, regardless of c)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (all Cc, cc, and bb: wait, no\u2014wait, no: CC is checkered red, Cc is checkered brown, cc is plain brown, bb is plain red.)\n\nSo, checking each genotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (brown)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (brown)\n- cc: Plain brown (brown)\n- bb: Plain red (red)\n\nTherefore, all four phenotypes are brown except for bb, which is red. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown: checkered (CC, Cc, cc) \u2192 75%\n- Red: plain (bb) \u2192 25%\n\nBut looking back, the options given don't include a 3:1 ratio for brown to red. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain brown\n- bb: Plain red\n\nSo, the number of checkered phenotypes (Checkered red and Checkered brown) is 2, and plain (Plain brown and Plain red) is also 2. Wait, that's not right\u2014it depends on whether the dominance applies differently. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently: count how many individuals have each phenotype.\n\nEach genotype contributes one phenotype, so:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 25% Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- 25% cc \u2192 Plain brown\n- 25% bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options suggest different ratios. Maybe I misapplied dominance. Let's consider that when B is present (i.e., any B allele), the bird is brown, even if C is recessive. Similarly, when c is present, it's plain, even if B is recessive.\n\nSo:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (B present)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (B present)\n- cc: Plain brown (c present)\n- bb: Plain red (c present)\n\nThus, all four phenotypes exist, but with different dominance. So, the proportion would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Cc)\n- Plain brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain red: 25% (bb)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer choices reflect this exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H list various ratios like 6:2, 8:4, etc. None seem to match 1:1:1:1. This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the F2 generation is incorrect. Maybe the F2 isn't the same as what I calculated earlier. Perhaps I missed something in the setup.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous. Wait, the question says \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the F1 would indeed be CcBb, and the F2 would follow the expected 25% each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio after considering dominance, where some phenotypes may combine. For example, if a bird is either checkered or plain, and either brown or red, then the ratio could be different. Let me re-examine the dominance:\n\n- For color (B):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 red\n\n- For pattern (C):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 checkered\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nThus, for each bird, both traits are expressed according to their alleles.\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, following these rules.\n\nNow, calculating the actual phenotypic outcomes based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (checkered red): Both C and B dominant \u2192 brown, checkered\n- Cc (checkered brown): C dominant, B recessive \u2192 brown, checkered\n- cc (plain brown): c dominant, B recessive \u2192 brown, plain\n- bb (plain red): b dominant, C recessive \u2192 red, plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Cc)\n- Plain brown: 25% (cc)\n- Plain red: 25% (bb)\n\nThis results in a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all four phenotypes. However, the answer options don't include such a ratio. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Again, doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all four phenotypes exist. Alternatively, perhaps the dominance is applied differently. Let me try listing each bird's phenotype:\n\nEach bird in F2 can be one of four genotypes, each contributing one phenotype:\n\n1. CC (checkered red)\n2. Cc (checkered brown)\n3. cc (plain brown)\n4. bb (plain red)\n\nSince all four phenotypes exist, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, the options don't provide this. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6:2\n\nB. 8:4\n\nC. 9:3\n\nD. 1:3\n\nE. 3:9\n\nF. 4:4\n\nG. 12:2\n\nH. 5:3\n\nI. 7:5\n\nJ. 2:6\n\nLooking through them, option J is 2:6, which simplifies to 1:3, suggesting checkered red : checkered brown is 1:3, while plain red : plain brown is 9:3 or 3:1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong in the way I calculated the F2 generation. Maybe the F2 generation isn't 25% each. Alternatively, perhaps the parents' gametes are not equally likely. Wait, but the user didn't specify any genetic ratios beyond the parents being homozygous. If the parents are homozygous for both genes, then all gametes would be equal.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the F2 generation includes a dihybrid cross without considering independent assortment. For instance, if the F1 is CcBb, then the F2 would involve each pair of genes separately. For example, the C locus would have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and similarly for B. Combining these, the F2 would have four phenotypes, each 25%.\n\nBut perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles rather than the exact combination. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either color, it would express that color. That complicates things, as now:\n\n- Checkered (C) \u2192 brown, unless both C and B are recessive.\n- Plain (c) \u2192 red, unless both B and b are recessive.\n\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- Brown (B) \u2192 brown, unless both B and b are recessive.\n- Red (b) \u2192 red, unless both B and b are recessive.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. The dominance applies per gene, not overall. So, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes individually.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both alleles for each gene. So:\n\nFor pigment color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 red\n\nFor pattern (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 checkered\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nSo, a bird is brown if it has at least one B allele. It's red if it has at least one b allele. Also, it's checkered if it has at least one C allele. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown and checkered: C present and B present \u2192 all cases except when c is present and/or B is recessive?\nWait, no. Let's use a table:\n\nBird | C | B | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCC | C present | B present | Brown, Checkered\nCc | C present | B recessive | Brown, Checkered\ncc | C recessive | B present | Brown, Plain\nbb | C recessive | B recessive | Red, Plain\n\nSo, all four phenotypes exist, each with 25% frequency. Hence, the ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the answer options match this.

Option Y is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. That corresponds to checkered red (25%) and plain red (25%), making a 1:1 ratio, but option Y seems to represent 8:4, which is a 2:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but that contradicts our previous conclusion. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the options, or perhaps I've misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the F2 generation has a certain ratio based on dihybrid crosses, without considering the dominance properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation isn't as straightforward as I thought.

All gametes from CC BB are CB, and all from cc bb are cb.\n\nSo, F1: CcBb\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb x cb)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes for each:\n\n1.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F2 generation to have a different ratio because of the dominance.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of thinking about all four phenotypes, perhaps the question is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color, it's brown; otherwise, it's red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for pattern, it's checkered; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would still be:\n\n- Brown (at least one B) \u2192 Checkered (if at least one C) or plain (if neither C nor B is dominant?)\n\nWait, no\u2014let's clarify. For pigment color:\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 red\n\nFor pattern:\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 checkered\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nThus, a bird can have:\n\n- Brown and Checkered: B and C dominant\n- Brown and Plain: B present, c present\n- Red and Checkered: b present, C present\n- Red and Plain: b present, c present\n\nAll four possibilities exist. Hence, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut again, the options don't reflect this. Let me check the options once more:\n\nLooking at the options, option J is 2:6 \u2192 1:3, which matches checkered red : checkered brown. Then, the remaining plain red : plain brown would be 3:1, which is option K. But the question asks for the F2 generation, which should have equal frequencies for all four phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only two traits and ignoring the others, but that doesn't align with the explanation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to a dihybrid cross with F1 being the parents, but in this case, the F1 is already CcBb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- Parents: CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n- F1: CcBb (heterozygous)\n- F2: After selfing F1 (CC x Cc for B; bb x Bb for C?), but no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so F2 would have all combinations.\n\nBut regardless, the F2 phenotypes are four, each 25%. Therefore, the ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match this.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me think differently: maybe the question is referring to the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross without considering the two separate loci, but that doesn't make sense because dihybrid crosses involve both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in the options, but I'll proceed with the best guess based on standard dihybrid cross calculations.\n\nGiven that the F2 ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the closest option is Y (8:4 \u2192 2:1), which represents checkered red and plain red in a 2:1 ratio. But this ignores the brown phenotype, which should also be present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of at least one dominant allele for pigment color, thus reducing the phenotypes to three categories: brown (any B), red (any b), and",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering the actual genes, each parent can only produce certain gametes.",
    "rollout": " However, considering the actual genes, each parent can only produce certain gametes. Parent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes. Therefore, the F1 (CcBb) must produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom CB gamete + CB gamete: CC BB (1/4 chance)\nFrom CB gamete + cb gamete: Cc BB (1/4 chance)\nWait, no. Correct approach: Each parent contributes either CB or cb. Since Parent 1 only contributes CB and Parent 2 only contributes cb, the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. Thus, the F2 will consist of four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% (CB + CB): CC BB\n- 25% (CB + cb): Cc BB\n- 25% (cb + CB): cc BB\n- 25% (cb + cb): cc bb\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in reality, each parent's gametes are equally likely to carry either allele. So the correct way is:\n\nEach parent produces either CB or cb, each with a probability of 50%. So the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb in 50% each.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc BB (25%)\n- From cb + CB: cc BB (25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, the next step is to determine the phenotypes based on the given traits:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant): Red\n  - c (recessive): Checkered\n- Color (B):\n  - B (dominant): Brown\n  - b (recessive): Checkered\n\nSo for each bird in F2, we'll look at their genotype and map it to phenotype.\n\nLet's list all F2 genotypes along with their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - C (dominant): Red pigment\n   - B (dominant): Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n\n2. Cc BB:\n   - C (dominant): Red\n   - B (dominant): Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n\n3. cc BB:\n   - c (recessive): Checkered\n   - B (dominant): Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n4. cc bb:\n   - c (recessive): Checkered\n   - b (recessive): Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype there are. Assuming equal distribution among the four F2 genotypes, there would be 25% each, but since the options don't include fractions, perhaps we assume 100% of each possible combination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the F2 will have four phenotypes based on their genotypes:\n\nPhenotypes and their counts (assuming each F2 individual is equally represented):\n\n- Red Brown: 25% (if F2 has four individuals)\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Checkered Checkered: 25%\n- Red Checkered: Not sure, because if all are either Red Brown, Checkered Brown, etc., then perhaps the third category is missing. Wait, but according to our analysis, the four F2 genotypes correspond to four distinct phenotypes. So in terms of phenotypic ratios, each phenotype would occur once out of four, but in the context of multiple generations, it depends on how many of each genotype are present.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, the answer choices don't directly reflect the four possible phenotypes. Instead, they group them into two categories: checkered and plain (which refers to B being recessive). Wait, no\u2014the original question specifies that \"checkered\" is when both C and c are recessive, i.e., cc. Similarly, \"plain\" is when both B and b are recessive, i.e., bb.\n\nWait, hold on. The question defines:\n\n- Dominant C = red pigment\n- Recessive c = plain (checkered)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered (plain)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So a bird is:\n\n- Red and Brown (C_B_): Phenotype: Red Brown\n- Red and Checkered (C_bb): Phenotype: Red Checkered\n- Checkered and Brown (cc_B_): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Checkered and Checkered (cc_bb): Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of these four phenotypes will appear based on the number of each genotype. If the F2 population is composed of equal numbers of each genotype (which would require specific conditions like complete dominance and no blending), then each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. However, looking at the options provided, none directly state 25% each. Instead, some options combine phenotypes. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This seems unlikely unless there's a different grouping.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, perhaps this implies that in the F2, the proportion of each phenotype is higher than 25%, but without knowing the exact counts, it's hard to say.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\n- Checkered is when both C and c are recessive: cc. So, any bird with cc in the first gene and either B or b in the second gene is checkered.\n- Plain is when both B and b are recessive: bb. So, any bird with bb in the second gene and either C or c in the first gene is plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Checkered and Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Checkered and Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nAssuming equal distribution among the four phenotypes, each would have a frequency of 25%. However, the options suggest different groupings. Perhaps the question groups checkered (including plain) under one category and red and brown under another, but that might not align with standard classifications.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are considering the presence of dominant alleles rather than the absence. For example:\n\n- If a bird is Red (C_) regardless of the second gene, it's considered checkered.\n- If a bird is Brown (B_), regardless of the first gene, it's considered checkered.\n\nWait, that could complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the combination of both genes. Maybe the options are grouped such that checkered is when either gene is checkered, and plain is when neither is checkered. That could change the interpretation.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered: Any bird where at least one gene is checkered (i.e., cc or bb)\n- Plain: Only when both genes are plain (cc and bb)\n\nBut in reality, checkered is when either gene is checkered, and plain is when both are plain. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered: cc or bb\n2. Plain: cc and bb (but since these are separate cases, it's still just plain)\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe definition given is:\n\n- Dominant C = red pigment\n- Recessive c = plain (checkered)\n\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered (plain)\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered: when at least one gene is recessive (either Cc, cc, B_, or _b)\n- Plain: when both genes are dominant (CC, BB, Cb, bB)\n\nBut in reality, when both genes are dominant, the bird is red and brown. If only one gene is recessive, it's either checkered (cc or bb) or plain (but wait, plain isn't a term used here; instead, 'plain' refers to the recessive state of B).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct terminology is:\n\n- Checkered: when both genes are recessive (cc and/or bb)\n- Plain: when both genes are dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because:\n\n- If both genes are dominant (CC or BB or Cb or bB), the bird is red and brown.\n- If only one gene is recessive (Cc, Cc, cc, Bb, bB, or Bb?), then it's either checkered (cc or bb) or something else?\n\nNo, that's not quite accurate. Let me re-express:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant (C) results in red pigment, recessive (c) results in checkered (plain).\n- Gene B: Dominant (B) results in brown, recessive (b) results in checkered.\n\nSo, for a bird to be:\n\n- Checkered: At least one recessive allele (either c in C or b in B)\n- Plain: Both alleles are dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So:\n\n- Checkered: cc, Cc, cc, Bb, bB, or bb?\nWait, no. Let's define it properly:\n\nA bird is Checkered if at least one of the two genes is recessive (i.e., either gene has a recessive allele). So:\n\n- If the bird is cc (gene C is recessive) OR bb (gene B is recessive), regardless of the other gene, it's Checkered.\n\n- If the bird is CC or BB (both dominant), then it's Red and Brown.\n\n- If the bird is Cb or bB (only one recessive allele), then it's either Checkered or something else? Wait, no. If only one recessive allele exists, does that make it Checkered or something else?\n\nWait, no. Actually, if only one recessive allele exists in a gene, it doesn't necessarily make it Checkered. For example, a bird with Bb would have a dominant B allele and a recessive b allele in gene B. So, if gene B is recessive (b), then it's Checkered, regardless of gene C.\n\nSimilarly, a bird with Bb would be:\n\n- Gene C: dominant (B), so red.\n- Gene B: recessive (b), so checkered.\n\nThus, such a bird would be Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, a bird with bb would have both recessive alleles, making it plain.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Checkered: any bird where at least one gene is recessive (cc or bb)\n- Plain: any bird where both genes are dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nWait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Let me re-examine:\n\nCheckered is defined as having at least one recessive allele in either gene. So, whether it's cc or bb or both, it's Checkered.\n\nPlain is when both genes are dominant: CC and BB, Cb, bB.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because Cb and bB are heterozygotes. In the context of pigmentation, Cb would mean gene C is dominant (red) and gene B is recessive (checkered). So, the bird would be Checkered, not plain.\n\nAh! So, confusion arises because if a bird has a dominant allele in one gene and a recessive allele in another, it's Checkered, not plain.\n\nTherefore, the correct definitions are:\n\n- Checkered: at least one recessive allele (cc or bb)\n- Plain: both dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nWait, but that would imply that Cb and bB are Checkered, while CC and BB are Red and Brown.\n\nYes, that makes sense now.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes and their corresponding genotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_): Genotype CC, CB, CB, BB\n2. Checkered (cc or bb): Genotype cc, Cc, Bb, Bb, bb\n3. Checkered (same as above): same as 2\n4. Plain (cc and bb): Genotype cc, bb\n\nWait, that can't be right because a bird with both genes recessive (cc and bb) would be plain, whereas others with at least one recessive are Checkered.\n\nBut in reality, a bird can only have one recessive allele per gene, but across both genes, it can have zero, one, or two recessive alleles. Therefore:\n\n- All birds except those with two dominant alleles (CC and BB, Cb, bB) are Checkered.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown (C_B_): CC, CB, CB, BB\n- Checkered (cc or bb): cc, Cc, Bb, Bb, bb\n- Checkered (same as above): same as above\n- Plain (cc and bb): same as above\n\nBut since Checkered includes both cc and bb, and plain is only when both are recessive (cc and bb), but Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nNo, actually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Plain: both genes are recessive (cc and bb)\n- Checkered: any bird where at least one gene is recessive (cc or bb)\n- Red and Brown: birds where both genes are dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Plain: cc and bb\n2. Checkered: cc, Cc, Bb, bB\n3. Red and Brown: CC, CB, BC, BB\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the probabilities of their genotypes.\n\nAssuming that the F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Red and Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Red and Brown)\n- 25% CB BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CB Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cb BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cb Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Bb BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cb Bb (Checkered Brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. The correct approach is to consider the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene segregates independently. So, the F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cb: Cc BB (25%), Cc Bb (25%), Cc cb (25%), c c Bb (25%) [Wait, no, that's not correct. Each gamete is CB, cb, cB, cb.]\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb):\n\nGametes from each parent:\n- Parent 1: CB, cb\n- Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nPossible combinations:\n- CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB x cb: Cc BB (25%), Cc Bb (25%), Cc cb (25%), c c Bb (25%) [Wait, no, each gamete is CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 would have 16 combinations, but grouped as follows.]\n\nActually, the correct Punnett square for F1 x F1 would yield:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC cb\n- 25% CB BB\n- 25% CB Bb\n- 25% CB cb\n- 25% cb BB\n- 25% cb Bb\n- 25% cb cb\n\nBut since CB and cb are the same in terms of function, we can simplify. However, considering the dominance hierarchy, each combination leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each parent is CcBb, the F1 will produce gametes with a 25% chance of each type: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nThen, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% (CB x CB): CC BB (Red and Brown)\n- 25% (CB x cb): Cc BB (Red and Brown)\n- 25% (cb x CB): cc BB (Checkered)\n- 25% (cb x cb): cc bb (Plain)\n- 25% (CB x cb): Cc Bb (Red and Brown)\n- 25% (cb x cb): cc Bb (Checkered)\n- 25% (cb x cb): cc bb (Plain)\n- 25% (cb x cb): cc Bb (Checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each parent produces four types of gametes, leading to 16 combinations in the F2. To avoid confusion, perhaps I should use a table:\n\nParent 1 gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb\nParent 2 gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nEach combination leads to a F2 genotype:\n\n1. CB x CB: CC BB (Red and Brown)\n2. CB x cb: Cc BB (Red and Brown)\n3. CB x cB: Cc Bb (Red and Brown)\n4. CB x cb: Cc Bb (Red and Brown)\n5. cb x CB: cc BB (Checkered)\n6. cb x cb: cc bb (Plain)\n7. cb x cB: cc Bb (Checkered)\n8. cb x cb: cc bb (Plain)\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red and Brown: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered: Cases 5,7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered (from other sources): Cases 6,8 \u2192 2 cases (but this overlaps with the previous)\nWait, no\u2014wait, Case 5 is cc BB (Checkered), Case 6 is cc Bb (Checkered), Case 7 is cc bb (Plain), and Case 8 is cc bb (Plain).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual genes, each parent can only produce certain gametes. Parent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes. Therefore, the F1 (CcBb) must produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each). Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom CB gamete + CB gamete: CC BB (1/4 chance)\nFrom CB gamete + cb gamete: Cc BB (1/4 chance)\nWait, no. Correct approach: Each parent contributes either CB or cb. Since Parent 1 only contributes CB and Parent 2 only contributes cb, the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. Thus, the F2 will consist of four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% (CB + CB): CC BB\n- 25% (CB + cb): Cc BB\n- 25% (cb + CB): cc BB\n- 25% (cb + cb): cc bb\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in reality, each parent's gametes are equally likely to carry either allele. So the correct way is:\n\nEach parent produces either CB or cb, each with a probability of 50%. So the F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes CB and cb in 50% each.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc BB (25%)\n- From cb + CB: cc BB (25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, the next step is to determine the phenotypes based on the given traits:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant): Red\n  - c (recessive): Checkered\n- Color (B):\n  - B (dominant): Brown\n  - b (recessive): Checkered\n\nSo for each bird in F2, we'll look at their genotype and map it to phenotype.\n\nLet's list all F2 genotypes along with their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - C (dominant): Red pigment\n   - B (dominant): Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n\n2. Cc BB:\n   - C (dominant): Red\n   - B (dominant): Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n\n3. cc BB:\n   - c (recessive): Checkered\n   - B (dominant): Brown\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n\n4. cc bb:\n   - c (recessive): Checkered\n   - b (recessive): Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype there are. Assuming equal distribution among the four F2 genotypes, there would be 25% each, but since the options don't include fractions, perhaps we assume 100% of each possible combination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the F2 will have four phenotypes based on their genotypes:\n\nPhenotypes and their counts (assuming each F2 individual is equally represented):\n\n- Red Brown: 25% (if F2 has four individuals)\n- Checkered Brown: 25%\n- Checkered Checkered: 25%\n- Red Checkered: Not sure, because if all are either Red Brown, Checkered Brown, etc., then perhaps the third category is missing. Wait, but according to our analysis, the four F2 genotypes correspond to four distinct phenotypes. So in terms of phenotypic ratios, each phenotype would occur once out of four, but in the context of multiple generations, it depends on how many of each genotype are present.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, the answer choices don't directly reflect the four possible phenotypes. Instead, they group them into two categories: checkered and plain (which refers to B being recessive). Wait, no\u2014the original question specifies that \"checkered\" is when both C and c are recessive, i.e., cc. Similarly, \"plain\" is when both B and b are recessive, i.e., bb.\n\nWait, hold on. The question defines:\n\n- Dominant C = red pigment\n- Recessive c = plain (checkered)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered (plain)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So a bird is:\n\n- Red and Brown (C_B_): Phenotype: Red Brown\n- Red and Checkered (C_bb): Phenotype: Red Checkered\n- Checkered and Brown (cc_B_): Phenotype: Checkered Brown\n- Checkered and Checkered (cc_bb): Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of these four phenotypes will appear based on the number of each genotype. If the F2 population is composed of equal numbers of each genotype (which would require specific conditions like complete dominance and no blending), then each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. However, looking at the options provided, none directly state 25% each. Instead, some options combine phenotypes. \n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This seems unlikely unless there's a different grouping.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, perhaps this implies that in the F2, the proportion of each phenotype is higher than 25%, but without knowing the exact counts, it's hard to say.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check:\n\n- Checkered is when both C and c are recessive: cc. So, any bird with cc in the first gene and either B or b in the second gene is checkered.\n- Plain is when both B and b are recessive: bb. So, any bird with bb in the second gene and either C or c in the first gene is plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Checkered and Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Checkered and Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nAssuming equal distribution among the four phenotypes, each would have a frequency of 25%. However, the options suggest different groupings. Perhaps the question groups checkered (including plain) under one category and red and brown under another, but that might not align with standard classifications.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are considering the presence of dominant alleles rather than the absence. For example:\n\n- If a bird is Red (C_) regardless of the second gene, it's considered checkered.\n- If a bird is Brown (B_), regardless of the first gene, it's considered checkered.\n\nWait, that could complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the combination of both genes. Maybe the options are grouped such that checkered is when either gene is checkered, and plain is when neither is checkered. That could change the interpretation.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered: Any bird where at least one gene is checkered (i.e., cc or bb)\n- Plain: Only when both genes are plain (cc and bb)\n\nBut in reality, checkered is when either gene is checkered, and plain is when both are plain. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered: cc or bb\n2. Plain: cc and bb (but since these are separate cases, it's still just plain)\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe definition given is:\n\n- Dominant C = red pigment\n- Recessive c = plain (checkered)\n\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered (plain)\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered: when at least one gene is recessive (either Cc, cc, B_, or _b)\n- Plain: when both genes are dominant (CC, BB, Cb, bB)\n\nBut in reality, when both genes are dominant, the bird is red and brown. If only one gene is recessive, it's either checkered (cc or bb) or plain (but wait, plain isn't a term used here; instead, 'plain' refers to the recessive state of B).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct terminology is:\n\n- Checkered: when both genes are recessive (cc and/or bb)\n- Plain: when both genes are dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because:\n\n- If both genes are dominant (CC or BB or Cb or bB), the bird is red and brown.\n- If only one gene is recessive (Cc, Cc, cc, Bb, bB, or Bb?), then it's either checkered (cc or bb) or something else?\n\nNo, that's not quite accurate. Let me re-express:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- Gene C: Dominant (C) results in red pigment, recessive (c) results in checkered (plain).\n- Gene B: Dominant (B) results in brown, recessive (b) results in checkered.\n\nSo, for a bird to be:\n\n- Checkered: At least one recessive allele (either c in C or b in B)\n- Plain: Both alleles are dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So:\n\n- Checkered: cc, Cc, cc, Bb, bB, or bb?\nWait, no. Let's define it properly:\n\nA bird is Checkered if at least one of the two genes is recessive (i.e., either gene has a recessive allele). So:\n\n- If the bird is cc (gene C is recessive) OR bb (gene B is recessive), regardless of the other gene, it's Checkered.\n\n- If the bird is CC or BB (both dominant), then it's Red and Brown.\n\n- If the bird is Cb or bB (only one recessive allele), then it's either Checkered or something else? Wait, no. If only one recessive allele exists, does that make it Checkered or something else?\n\nWait, no. Actually, if only one recessive allele exists in a gene, it doesn't necessarily make it Checkered. For example, a bird with Bb would have a dominant B allele and a recessive b allele in gene B. So, if gene B is recessive (b), then it's Checkered, regardless of gene C.\n\nSimilarly, a bird with Bb would be:\n\n- Gene C: dominant (B), so red.\n- Gene B: recessive (b), so checkered.\n\nThus, such a bird would be Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, a bird with bb would have both recessive alleles, making it plain.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Checkered: any bird where at least one gene is recessive (cc or bb)\n- Plain: any bird where both genes are dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nWait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Let me re-examine:\n\nCheckered is defined as having at least one recessive allele in either gene. So, whether it's cc or bb or both, it's Checkered.\n\nPlain is when both genes are dominant: CC and BB, Cb, bB.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because Cb and bB are heterozygotes. In the context of pigmentation, Cb would mean gene C is dominant (red) and gene B is recessive (checkered). So, the bird would be Checkered, not plain.\n\nAh! So, confusion arises because if a bird has a dominant allele in one gene and a recessive allele in another, it's Checkered, not plain.\n\nTherefore, the correct definitions are:\n\n- Checkered: at least one recessive allele (cc or bb)\n- Plain: both dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nWait, but that would imply that Cb and bB are Checkered, while CC and BB are Red and Brown.\n\nYes, that makes sense now.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes and their corresponding genotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_): Genotype CC, CB, CB, BB\n2. Checkered (cc or bb): Genotype cc, Cc, Bb, Bb, bb\n3. Checkered (same as above): same as 2\n4. Plain (cc and bb): Genotype cc, bb\n\nWait, that can't be right because a bird with both genes recessive (cc and bb) would be plain, whereas others with at least one recessive are Checkered.\n\nBut in reality, a bird can only have one recessive allele per gene, but across both genes, it can have zero, one, or two recessive alleles. Therefore:\n\n- All birds except those with two dominant alleles (CC and BB, Cb, bB) are Checkered.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown (C_B_): CC, CB, CB, BB\n- Checkered (cc or bb): cc, Cc, Bb, Bb, bb\n- Checkered (same as above): same as above\n- Plain (cc and bb): same as above\n\nBut since Checkered includes both cc and bb, and plain is only when both are recessive (cc and bb), but Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nNo, actually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Plain: both genes are recessive (cc and bb)\n- Checkered: any bird where at least one gene is recessive (cc or bb)\n- Red and Brown: birds where both genes are dominant (CC and BB, Cb, bB)\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Plain: cc and bb\n2. Checkered: cc, Cc, Bb, bB\n3. Red and Brown: CC, CB, BC, BB\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the probabilities of their genotypes.\n\nAssuming that the F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Red and Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Red and Brown)\n- 25% CB BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CB Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cb BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cb Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Bb BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cb Bb (Checkered Brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. The correct approach is to consider the independent assortment of the two genes. Each gene segregates independently. So, the F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB x cb: Cc BB (25%), Cc Bb (25%), Cc cb (25%), c c Bb (25%) [Wait, no, that's not correct. Each gamete is CB, cb, cB, cb.]\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb):\n\nGametes from each parent:\n- Parent 1: CB, cb\n- Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nPossible combinations:\n- CB x CB: CC BB (25%)\n- CB x cb: Cc BB (25%), Cc Bb (25%), Cc cb (25%), c c Bb (25%) [Wait, no, each gamete is CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 would have 16 combinations, but grouped as follows.]\n\nActually, the correct Punnett square for F1 x F1 would yield:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC cb\n- 25% CB BB\n- 25% CB Bb\n- 25% CB cb\n- 25% cb BB\n- 25% cb Bb\n- 25% cb cb\n\nBut since CB and cb are the same in terms of function, we can simplify. However, considering the dominance hierarchy, each combination leads to a specific phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each parent is CcBb, the F1 will produce gametes with a 25% chance of each type: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nThen, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% (CB x CB): CC BB (Red and Brown)\n- 25% (CB x cb): Cc BB (Red and Brown)\n- 25% (cb x CB): cc BB (Checkered)\n- 25% (cb x cb): cc bb (Plain)\n- 25% (CB x cb): Cc Bb (Red and Brown)\n- 25% (cb x cb): cc Bb (Checkered)\n- 25% (cb x cb): cc bb (Plain)\n- 25% (cb x cb): cc Bb (Checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Each parent produces four types of gametes, leading to 16 combinations in the F2. To avoid confusion, perhaps I should use a table:\n\nParent 1 gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb\nParent 2 gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nEach combination leads to a F2 genotype:\n\n1. CB x CB: CC BB (Red and Brown)\n2. CB x cb: Cc BB (Red and Brown)\n3. CB x cB: Cc Bb (Red and Brown)\n4. CB x cb: Cc Bb (Red and Brown)\n5. cb x CB: cc BB (Checkered)\n6. cb x cb: cc bb (Plain)\n7. cb x cB: cc Bb (Checkered)\n8. cb x cb: cc bb (Plain)\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Red and Brown: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered: Cases 5,7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered (from other sources): Cases 6,8 \u2192 2 cases (but this overlaps with the previous)\nWait, no\u2014wait, Case 5 is cc BB (Checkered), Case 6 is cc Bb (Checkered), Case 7 is cc bb (Plain), and Case 8 is cc bb (Plain). So:\n\n- Checkered: Cases 5",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, since the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, since the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But the question is about the phenotypic ratio considering both genes. Let me proceed.\n\nNow, regarding the phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment color (gene C):\n  - C (dominant): red\n  - c (recessive): plain\n\n- Color (gene B):\n  - B (dominant): brown\n  - b (recessive): checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes depend on both genes. Let's list all possible genotypes and then determine the phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider the F2 generation directly. In a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the F2 generation follows a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but since there are two traits, we'll have to combine them into a phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, actually, the dihybrid cross (two independent genes) results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio if each trait is determined separately. However, since some phenotypes might overlap, like having both C and B, etc., the actual number of phenotypes depends on the combination.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible genotypes for pigment color (C):\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the combined probability for any genotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nTo get the phenotypic ratios, we'll look at how many individuals fall into each category of the two traits.\n\nLet's make a table of all possible combinations:\n\n1. **Red and Brown (C B):**\n   - C (red) and B (brown): All these individuals will have both traits expressed.\n   - Probability: (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n   \n2. **Red and Checkered (C bb):**\n   - C (red) and bb (checkered).\n   - Probability: 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n\n3. **Plain and Brown (cc B):**\n   - cc (plain) and B (brown).\n   - Probability: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n\n4. **Plain and Checkered (cc bb):**\n   - cc (plain) and bb (checkered).\n   - Probability: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 56.25%. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 100%, indicating that some phenotypes might be overlapping or perhaps I missed something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in categorizing the phenotypes. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering each individual's phenotype based on both genes:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C B): Phenotype is checkered red.\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (bb): Phenotype is checkered brown.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is present (B): Phenotype is plain brown.\n- If both C and B are absent (cc bb): Phenotype is plain red.\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (C B):**\n   - Probability: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n   \n2. **Checkered Brown (C bb):**\n   - Probability: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n   \n3. **Plain Brown (cc B):**\n   - Probability: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n   \n4. **Plain Red (cc bb):**\n   - Probability: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nThese sum up to approximately 100% (4+2+2+1=9 parts).\n\nSo now, converting these fractions to whole numbers by multiplying by 9:\n\n- Checkered Red: 44.44% * 9 \u2248 40 (but since we need exact counts, perhaps better to use the actual counts from a Punnett square.)\nWait, perhaps instead of percentages, let's count the number of each phenotype in a large sample.\n\nAssuming a large number of offspring, say 81 individuals (since 9*9=81):\n\n- Checkered Red (C B): 4 parts \u2192 4*(number of individuals) = 4*81=324\n- Checkered Brown (C bb): 2 parts \u2192 2*81=162\n- Plain Brown (cc B): 2 parts \u2192 2*81=162\n- Plain Red (cc bb): 1 part \u2192 1*81=81\n\nTotal: 324 + 162 + 162 + 81 = 730? Wait, that's over 81. Hmm, perhaps scaling down.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the approach. Instead of counting parts, let's compute the exact number from the probabilities.\n\nIf we assume a population of 81 (since 9x9=81):\n\n- Checkered Red (4/9 of 81): 4*9=36\n- Checkered Brown (2/9): 2*9=18\n- Plain Brown (2/9): 18\n- Plain Red (1/9): 9\n\nWait, 36 + 18 + 18 + 9 = 72. That's still missing one. Maybe it's better to stick with the fraction-based approach for the ratios.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 for Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Includes zero, which may not be accurate\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 This seems to align with our earlier calculation, except our calculation showed different numbers. Wait, no\u2014in my previous calculation, the total was 9:3:3:1, but when scaled to 81, it becomes 36:18:18:9, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1. So the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1, but when simplified, it's 3:1:1:0.333, which isn't matching exactly. Perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the 9:3:3:1 refers to the four phenotypes, but in reality, some phenotypes may not occur together, leading to fewer categories. For example, in some cases, certain combinations may not lead to distinct phenotypes due to epistasis or dominance relationships. In this case, since both C and B are dominant, all four phenotypes are possible. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which sums to 5+3+2+6=16. That doesn't fit. Option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which also sums to 16. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which sums to 16. Option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which sums to 12. Option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", totaling 16.\n\nWait, none of these seem to fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me re-examine the phenotypes and their probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of the dominant alleles rather than the specific combinations. But given the way the question is phrased, it likely expects the 9:3:3:1 ratio adjusted to include all four phenotypes without overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- Color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, for a bird to express a particular phenotype, it must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n\nEach of these can occur independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Now, applying this to a hypothetical F2 generation, which would have 81 individuals (assuming 9x9 grid), the expected counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 36 (9/36)\n- Checkered Brown: 18 (3/36)\n- Plain Brown: 18 (3/36)\n- Plain Red: 9 (1/36)\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect this exact breakdown. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16, which doesn't match.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16, also doesn't match.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12, doesn't match.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nHmm, option E sums to 16, but according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the correct sum should be 16. Wait, but in reality, the sum is 9+3+3+1=16. So option E's total is 16, which matches. But does it match the ratio?\n\nThe 9:3:3:1 ratio should correspond to 9,3,3,1, but option E has 3,9,1,3, which is a permutation. Depending on how the options are presented, it could be considered equivalent, as the order doesn't matter for the ratio. However, in terms of actual counts, the 9:3:3:1 corresponds to 9,3,3,1, while option E is 3,9,1,3, which is a rearrangement. But typically, ratios are written in ascending order, so 3:9:1:3 wouldn't be standard. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, which states the ratio as 6:2:6:2, but that's 16, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify whether the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype or the proportion. Given that the options present ratios like 6,2,6,2, it suggests that the question wants the absolute counts. In that case, the 9:3:3:1 translates to 9,3,3,1, but none of the options match this exactly. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16, but the 9:3:3:1 ratio would imply 9,3,3,1. None of the options perfectly match this. However, option D is 1,3,9,3, which is similar but reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the simplified ratio, such as 3:1:1:0.333, but that's not among the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option H, which is 5,3,2,6, adding up to 16. But according to our analysis, the correct counts are 9,3,3,1. However, since the options don't match, perhaps the closest is option D, which is 1,3,9,3, but that's inconsistent with the expected 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me recount the F2 generation properly. When crossing CcBb x CcBb, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Combining these, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC (CB + CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc (CB + cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc (cb + cb) \u2192 25%\n\nFor color B:\n\n- BB (cb + cb) \u2192 25%\n- Bb (cb + cb) \u2192 50%\n- bb (cb + cb) \u2192 25%\n\nCombining both, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. The actual counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB \u2192 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb \u2192 25% of 50% = 12.5%\n- Plain Brown: Cc BB \u2192 50% of 25% = 12.5%\n- Plain Red: cc BB \u2192 25% of 25% = 6.25%\n\nSumming these, 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 37.5% of the population.\n\nConverting to 81 individuals (a round number), this gives:\n\n- Checkered Red: 6.25 * 81 \u2248 50.625 \u2192 Approximately 51\n- Checkered Brown: 12.5 * 81 \u2248 1012.5 \u2192 101\n- Plain Brown: 12.5 * 81 \u2248 1012.5 \u2192 101\n- Plain Red: 6.25 * 81 \u2248 50.625 \u2192 Approximately 51\n\nThis totals around 204, which is incorrect. I think I'm making a mistake here. Actually, in a dihybrid cross with two independent genes, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. Each of these represents the proportion of each phenotype relative to the others. To apply this to a larger population, say 81 individuals, we'd have:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/16 of 81 \u2192 (9/16)*81 \u2248 46.875 \u2192 ~47\n- Checkered Brown: 3/16 of 81 \u2192 ~15.5625 \u2192 ~16\n- Plain Brown: 3/16 of 81 \u2192 ~15.5625 \u2192 ~16\n- Plain Red: 1/16 of 81 \u2192 ~5.0625 \u2192 ~5\n\nBut these aren't integers, so rounding might be needed. Alternatively, the exact counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 45\n- Checkered Brown: 13\n- Plain Brown: 13\n- Plain Red: 6\n\nThis adds up to 77, which is close but not exact. However, this doesn't match any of the answer options exactly. Looking back at the options, option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. But according to the 9:3:3:1, the correct counts are 9,3,3,1. None of the options match this precisely, but option D is the closest in structure. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the ratio to be based on the presence of the dominant allele, which would change things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation includes all possible gametes, including those that didn't fully express the traits due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, without more context, it's challenging to adjust.\n\nGiven the confusion and potential errors in translation, I'll go with the most logical conclusion based on the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio and see which option fits best. Among the options provided, option H states \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which sums to 16. However, according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the correct counts would be 9,3,3,1, which doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the ratio differently, and the closest option is H, even though it's slightly off.\n\nBut upon closer inspection, I realize that the correct 9:3:3:1 ratio should mean that each phenotype occurs 9,3,3,1 times respectively, assuming a 9x9 grid. However, the options don't provide this exact breakdown. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is a permutation of the correct ratio. Depending on the ordering, option D could be considered correct if the order doesn't matter, but strictly speaking, it's not accurate. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16 as well. \n\nSince the user provided multiple-choice answers, I'll choose the option that lists the counts in descending order, which would be option D: 1,3,9,3. But this doesn't strictly follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which sums to 16 but represents a different distribution.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, since the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But the question is about the phenotypic ratio considering both genes. Let me proceed.\n\nNow, regarding the phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment color (gene C):\n  - C (dominant): red\n  - c (recessive): plain\n\n- Color (gene B):\n  - B (dominant): brown\n  - b (recessive): checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes depend on both genes. Let's list all possible genotypes and then determine the phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider the F2 generation directly. In a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the F2 generation follows a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, but since there are two traits, we'll have to combine them into a phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, actually, the dihybrid cross (two independent genes) results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio if each trait is determined separately. However, since some phenotypes might overlap, like having both C and B, etc., the actual number of phenotypes depends on the combination.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible genotypes for pigment color (C):\n\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nEach gene is independently assorting, so the combined probability for any genotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nTo get the phenotypic ratios, we'll look at how many individuals fall into each category of the two traits.\n\nLet's make a table of all possible combinations:\n\n1. **Red and Brown (C B):**\n   - C (red) and B (brown): All these individuals will have both traits expressed.\n   - Probability: (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n   \n2. **Red and Checkered (C bb):**\n   - C (red) and bb (checkered).\n   - Probability: 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n\n3. **Plain and Brown (cc B):**\n   - cc (plain) and B (brown).\n   - Probability: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%\n\n4. **Plain and Checkered (cc bb):**\n   - cc (plain) and bb (checkered).\n   - Probability: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 6.25 = 56.25%. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 100%, indicating that some phenotypes might be overlapping or perhaps I missed something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in categorizing the phenotypes. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering each individual's phenotype based on both genes:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C B): Phenotype is checkered red.\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (bb): Phenotype is checkered brown.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is present (B): Phenotype is plain brown.\n- If both C and B are absent (cc bb): Phenotype is plain red.\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (C B):**\n   - Probability: (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n   \n2. **Checkered Brown (C bb):**\n   - Probability: (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n   \n3. **Plain Brown (cc B):**\n   - Probability: (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n   \n4. **Plain Red (cc bb):**\n   - Probability: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nThese sum up to approximately 100% (4+2+2+1=9 parts).\n\nSo now, converting these fractions to whole numbers by multiplying by 9:\n\n- Checkered Red: 44.44% * 9 \u2248 40 (but since we need exact counts, perhaps better to use the actual counts from a Punnett square.)\nWait, perhaps instead of percentages, let's count the number of each phenotype in a large sample.\n\nAssuming a large number of offspring, say 81 individuals (since 9*9=81):\n\n- Checkered Red (C B): 4 parts \u2192 4*(number of individuals) = 4*81=324\n- Checkered Brown (C bb): 2 parts \u2192 2*81=162\n- Plain Brown (cc B): 2 parts \u2192 2*81=162\n- Plain Red (cc bb): 1 part \u2192 1*81=81\n\nTotal: 324 + 162 + 162 + 81 = 730? Wait, that's over 81. Hmm, perhaps scaling down.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the approach. Instead of counting parts, let's compute the exact number from the probabilities.\n\nIf we assume a population of 81 (since 9x9=81):\n\n- Checkered Red (4/9 of 81): 4*9=36\n- Checkered Brown (2/9): 2*9=18\n- Plain Brown (2/9): 18\n- Plain Red (1/9): 9\n\nWait, 36 + 18 + 18 + 9 = 72. That's still missing one. Maybe it's better to stick with the fraction-based approach for the ratios.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 for Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Includes zero, which may not be accurate\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 This seems to align with our earlier calculation, except our calculation showed different numbers. Wait, no\u2014in my previous calculation, the total was 9:3:3:1, but when scaled to 81, it becomes 36:18:18:9, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1. So the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1, but when simplified, it's 3:1:1:0.333, which isn't matching exactly. Perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the 9:3:3:1 refers to the four phenotypes, but in reality, some phenotypes may not occur together, leading to fewer categories. For example, in some cases, certain combinations may not lead to distinct phenotypes due to epistasis or dominance relationships. In this case, since both C and B are dominant, all four phenotypes are possible. Thus, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" which sums to 5+3+2+6=16. That doesn't fit. Option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\", which also sums to 16. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which sums to 16. Option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which sums to 12. Option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", totaling 16.\n\nWait, none of these seem to fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me re-examine the phenotypes and their probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the presence of the dominant alleles rather than the specific combinations. But given the way the question is phrased, it likely expects the 9:3:3:1 ratio adjusted to include all four phenotypes without overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- Color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, for a bird to express a particular phenotype, it must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Both C and B recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n\nEach of these can occur independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Now, applying this to a hypothetical F2 generation, which would have 81 individuals (assuming 9x9 grid), the expected counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 36 (9/36)\n- Checkered Brown: 18 (3/36)\n- Plain Brown: 18 (3/36)\n- Plain Red: 9 (1/36)\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect this exact breakdown. Looking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16, which doesn't match.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16, also doesn't match.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12, doesn't match.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nHmm, option E sums to 16, but according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the correct sum should be 16. Wait, but in reality, the sum is 9+3+3+1=16. So option E's total is 16, which matches. But does it match the ratio?\n\nThe 9:3:3:1 ratio should correspond to 9,3,3,1, but option E has 3,9,1,3, which is a permutation. Depending on how the options are presented, it could be considered equivalent, as the order doesn't matter for the ratio. However, in terms of actual counts, the 9:3:3:1 corresponds to 9,3,3,1, while option E is 3,9,1,3, which is a rearrangement. But typically, ratios are written in ascending order, so 3:9:1:3 wouldn't be standard.

However, this doesn't match any of the answer options exactly. Looking back at the options, option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. But according to the 9:3:3:1, the correct counts are 9,3,3,1. None of the options match this precisely, but option D is the closest in structure. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the ratio to be based on the presence of the dominant allele, which would change things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation includes all possible gametes, including those that didn't fully express the traits due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, without more context, it's challenging to adjust.\n\nGiven the confusion and potential errors in translation, I'll go with the most logical conclusion based on the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio and see which option fits best. Among the options provided, option H states \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which sums to 16. However, according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the correct counts would be 9,3,3,1, which doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the ratio differently, and the closest option is H, even though it's slightly off.\n\nBut upon closer inspection, I realize that the correct 9:3:3:1 ratio should mean that each phenotype occurs 9,3,3,1 times respectively, assuming a 9x9 grid. However, the options don't provide this exact breakdown. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is a permutation of the correct ratio. Depending on the ordering, option D could be considered correct if the order doesn't matter, but strictly speaking, it's not accurate. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16 as well. \n\nSince the user provided multiple-choice answers, I'll choose the option that lists the counts in descending order, which would be option D: 1,3,9,3. But this doesn't strictly follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which sums to 16 but represents a different distribution.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Although this doesn't match",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, considering the dominance hierarchy, some phenotypes might combine. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me consider the actual crosses. The F1 would be CcBb. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete from F1 is either CB or cb. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (heterozygous)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: cc BB (homozygous recessive)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, each gamete is CB or cb, each at 50%. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut considering dominance, let's determine the phenotypes.\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype for pigment color depends on whether the individual has at least one dominant C allele.\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype for color depends on whether the individual has at least one dominant B allele.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible genotypes in F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (Red), B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 C (Red), B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 c (Checkered), B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. cc bb \u2192 c (Checkered), b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, that seems off because in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So, any genotype where C is present (i.e., CC or Cc) results in Checkered Pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, any genotype where B is present (i.e., B or Bb) results in Brown Color, regardless of C. Only those genotypes without C or without B will result in the opposite phenotype.\n\nLet me calculate the probability for each genotype:\n\nThe F2 generation will have four possible genotypes, each with equal probability (25% each).\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered Red\nCc Bb | Checkered Brown\ncc BB | Checkered Red\ncc bb | Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Checkered Red: occurs when there is at least one C (either CC or Cc) AND at least one B (either B or Bb). Looking at the above table, the genotypes that satisfy this are Cc Bb, cc BB, and CC BB. Wait, but in our case, the F2 generation includes four possible genotypes, each equally likely. So how many have both C and B?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- CC BB: C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: C and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: c and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc bb: c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because in the F2, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene determines the phenotype. So, for Pigmentation (C), if the individual has at least one C, they are Checkered Pigment. For Color (B), if the individual has at least one B, they are Brown Color. So, the phenotype is determined by both genes. If both are present, it's the combination of both traits. If either is missing, it's the other trait.\n\nSo, checking each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Cc Bb: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB: c (no C) and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. cc bb: c (no C) and b (no B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, in terms of counts:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Case 2 \u2192 1 case\n- Checkered Red again: same as before\n- Plain Brown: Case 4 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4 cases, which matches the total. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3/4\n- Checkered Brown: 1/4\n- Checkered Red again: another 1/4\n- Plain Brown: 1/4\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the F2 generation, each trait is independent, so the phenotypic ratios are multiplied accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for Checkered Red to Checkered Brown, and 1:1 for Checkered Red to Plain Brown, but wait, that's not quite accurate. Because the presence of one trait affects the others. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to count the number of individuals who exhibit each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: All individuals who have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. In the F2 generation, this corresponds to three out of four genotypes (since only the cc bb genotype lacks both traits).\n  \n- **Checkered Brown**: Individuals with at least one dominant C but lack a dominant B. This would correspond to the Cc Bb genotype, which is one out of four.\n  \n- **Plain Brown**: Individuals with no dominant C (i.e., cc) but have at least one dominant B (i.e., B or Bb). This corresponds to the cc BB and cc Bb genotypes, totaling two out of four.\n  \n- **Plain Red**: Individuals with neither dominant C nor dominant B. This is the cc bb genotype, which is one out of four.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the phenotype was determined by both traits. So, let me clarify:\n\nEach individual's phenotype is determined by their combination of the two traits. So, an individual with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B will have Checkered Red. An individual with at least one dominant C but no dominant B will have Checkered Brown. Conversely, an individual with no dominant C but at least one dominant B will have Plain Brown. And finally, someone with neither dominant C nor B will have Plain Red.\n\nSo, applying this to the F2 generation:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: cc bb (1 out of 4)\n- **Checkered Brown**: Cc Bb (1 out of 4)\n- **Plain Brown**: cc BB and cc Bb (2 out of 4)\n- **Plain Red**: cc bb (1 out of 4)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\n- Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red = 1 : 1 : 2 : 1\n\nWhich translates to 1 part Checkered Red, 1 part Checkered Brown, 2 parts Plain Brown, and 1 part Plain Red.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none directly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H don't include such a ratio. They range from 1:6:2:6 (Option D) to 2:6:2:2 (Option E), etc. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the genotypes' probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps my assumption that each gamete is equally likely (50%) is incorrect. Let me reconsider the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes based on the laws of inheritance:\n\n- Homozygous for C (CC): 25%\n- Heterozygous for C (Cc): 50%\n- Homozygous for B (bb): 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B, the presence of dominant B would lead to Brown, and recessive b to Checkered.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. Cc BB (25%)\n5. Cc Bb (25%)\n6. Cc bb (25%)\n7. cc BB (25%)\n8. cc Bb (25%)\n9. cc bb (25%)\n\nThis accounts for all possible combinations, making nine genotypes, each 25% chance.\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes based on each genotype:\n\n- For Pigmentation (C):\n  - Dominant (C): Any genotype with C (CC, Cc, ...) \u2192 Checkered Pigment\n  - Recessive (cc): Plain Pigment\n\n- For Color (B):\n  - Dominant (B): Any genotype with B (BB, Bb, ...) \u2192 Brown Color\n  - Recessive (bb): Checkered Color\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Thus, the phenotype is a combination of both.\n\nPhenotype categories:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered Red\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered Brown\n3. C absent, B present: Plain Brown\n4. Neither C nor B present: Plain Red\n\nNow, counting each category:\n\n1. Checkered Red: Genotypes where C and B are both present: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 genotypes\n2. Checkered Brown: Genotype CC bb \u2192 1 genotype\n3. Plain Brown: Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n4. Plain Red: Genotype cc bb \u2192 1 genotype\n\nTotal genotypes: 9, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red = 4 : 1 : 2 : 1\n\nSimplifying, dividing by the greatest common divisor (which is 1), we get 4:1:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't align with my calculation. Option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which also doesn't fit. Option F says \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which sums to 16, whereas the total is 9. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown: CC bb \u2192 1\n- Plain Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nYes, that adds up to 8, but there are 9 genotypes. Oh, wait, I missed one. Let me see: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. That's 9. So the phenotypic ratio should sum to 9.\n\nWait, but according to my previous analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 4:1:2:1, adding up to 8, which contradicts the 9 total. So perhaps I made a mistake in categorization. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to look at the number of each phenotype based on the combined dominance of both traits.\n\nEach individual will display a phenotype based on the presence of C and B.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 5 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Red: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nAdding up to 8, which still doesn't make sense because there are 9 genotypes. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me list them clearly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nThat's 9, categorized into 4,1,2,1 respectively. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:1:2:1. Now, looking at the answer choices, none exactly match this. The closest is option J, which says 2,6,3,1. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the phenotype isn't purely additive but follows a different logic. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation combines the traits differently.\n\nAnother approach is to use the Punnett square method. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have all combinations where each gene is segregating independently.\n\nUsing a Punnett square, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n```\n      B    b\nC     CB  cB\nc     cB  cc\n```\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n```\n    Bb   Bb\ncc    cc\n```\n\nNo, that's not correct either. Let me think of it properly. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes either C/B or c/b. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nAs previously, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4\n- Checkered Brown: 1\n- Plain Brown: 2\n- Plain Red: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:1:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, I don't see an exact match. The closest is option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which doesn't add up to 12, but perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question and need to reevaluate. Another possibility is that the F2 generation refers to the number of offspring after two generations, but perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation relative to the parents, but that doesn't change the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where the parents are both heterozygous for both genes, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio in the F2 generation. But in this case, the parents are not both heterozygous; one is homozygous dominant, and the other is homozygous recessive. Therefore, the F2 won't follow a simple 9:3:3:1 ratio but instead follow the rules outlined above.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 4:1:2:1, which corresponds to Checkered Red:Checkered Brown:Plain Brown:Plain Red = 4:1:2:1. None of the options perfectly reflect this, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2013 Doesn't make sense as total is 16.\n\nOption J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 Total is 12.\n\nOption F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2013 Total is 16.\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 Doesn't align.\n\nPerhaps I need to revisit my calculations. Wait, I realize now that when the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. Cc BB (25%)\n5. Cc Bb (25%)\n6. Cc bb (25%)\n7. cc BB (25%)\n8. cc Bb (25%)\n9. cc bb (25%)\n\nAs previously, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Brown\n3. Checkered Red\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Brown\n6. Checkered Red\n7. Plain Brown\n8. Plain Brown\n9. Plain Red\n\nCounting:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,2,3,4,6 \u2192 5 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Case 5 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Red: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nHmm, that gives 5:1:2:1, which is still inconsistent with the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to a particular phenotype",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the dominance hierarchy, some phenotypes might combine. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me consider the actual crosses. The F1 would be CcBb. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete from F1 is either CB or cb. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (heterozygous)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: cc BB (homozygous recessive)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, each gamete is CB or cb, each at 50%. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut considering dominance, let's determine the phenotypes.\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype for pigment color depends on whether the individual has at least one dominant C allele.\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype for color depends on whether the individual has at least one dominant B allele.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible genotypes in F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (Red), B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 C (Red), B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 c (Checkered), B (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. cc bb \u2192 c (Checkered), b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, that seems off because in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So, any genotype where C is present (i.e., CC or Cc) results in Checkered Pigment, regardless of B. Similarly, any genotype where B is present (i.e., B or Bb) results in Brown Color, regardless of C. Only those genotypes without C or without B will result in the opposite phenotype.\n\nLet me calculate the probability for each genotype:\n\nThe F2 generation will have four possible genotypes, each with equal probability (25% each).\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered Red\nCc Bb | Checkered Brown\ncc BB | Checkered Red\ncc bb | Plain Brown\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Checkered Red: occurs when there is at least one C (either CC or Cc) AND at least one B (either B or Bb). Looking at the above table, the genotypes that satisfy this are Cc Bb, cc BB, and CC BB. Wait, but in our case, the F2 generation includes four possible genotypes, each equally likely. So how many have both C and B?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- CC BB: C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: C and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: c and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n- cc bb: c and b \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because in the F2, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene determines the phenotype. So, for Pigmentation (C), if the individual has at least one C, they are Checkered Pigment. For Color (B), if the individual has at least one B, they are Brown Color. So, the phenotype is determined by both genes. If both are present, it's the combination of both traits. If either is missing, it's the other trait.\n\nSo, checking each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Cc Bb: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB: c (no C) and B \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. cc bb: c (no C) and b (no B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, in terms of counts:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Case 2 \u2192 1 case\n- Checkered Red again: same as before\n- Plain Brown: Case 4 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4 cases, which matches the total. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 3/4\n- Checkered Brown: 1/4\n- Checkered Red again: another 1/4\n- Plain Brown: 1/4\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the F2 generation, each trait is independent, so the phenotypic ratios are multiplied accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for Checkered Red to Checkered Brown, and 1:1 for Checkered Red to Plain Brown, but wait, that's not quite accurate. Because the presence of one trait affects the others. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to count the number of individuals who exhibit each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: All individuals who have at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. In the F2 generation, this corresponds to three out of four genotypes (since only the cc bb genotype lacks both traits).\n  \n- **Checkered Brown**: Individuals with at least one dominant C but lack a dominant B. This would correspond to the Cc Bb genotype, which is one out of four.\n  \n- **Plain Brown**: Individuals with no dominant C (i.e., cc) but have at least one dominant B (i.e., B or Bb). This corresponds to the cc BB and cc Bb genotypes, totaling two out of four.\n  \n- **Plain Red**: Individuals with neither dominant C nor dominant B. This is the cc bb genotype, which is one out of four.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the phenotype was determined by both traits. So, let me clarify:\n\nEach individual's phenotype is determined by their combination of the two traits. So, an individual with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B will have Checkered Red. An individual with at least one dominant C but no dominant B will have Checkered Brown. Conversely, an individual with no dominant C but at least one dominant B will have Plain Brown. And finally, someone with neither dominant C nor B will have Plain Red.\n\nSo, applying this to the F2 generation:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: cc bb (1 out of 4)\n- **Checkered Brown**: Cc Bb (1 out of 4)\n- **Plain Brown**: cc BB and cc Bb (2 out of 4)\n- **Plain Red**: cc bb (1 out of 4)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\n- Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red = 1 : 1 : 2 : 1\n\nWhich translates to 1 part Checkered Red, 1 part Checkered Brown, 2 parts Plain Brown, and 1 part Plain Red.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none directly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H don't include such a ratio. They range from 1:6:2:6 (Option D) to 2:6:2:2 (Option E), etc. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the genotypes' probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps my assumption that each gamete is equally likely (50%) is incorrect. Let me reconsider the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes based on the laws of inheritance:\n\n- Homozygous for C (CC): 25%\n- Heterozygous for C (Cc): 50%\n- Homozygous for B (bb): 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B, the presence of dominant B would lead to Brown, and recessive b to Checkered.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. Cc BB (25%)\n5. Cc Bb (25%)\n6. Cc bb (25%)\n7. cc BB (25%)\n8. cc Bb (25%)\n9. cc bb (25%)\n\nThis accounts for all possible combinations, making nine genotypes, each 25% chance.\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes based on each genotype:\n\n- For Pigmentation (C):\n  - Dominant (C): Any genotype with C (CC, Cc, ...) \u2192 Checkered Pigment\n  - Recessive (cc): Plain Pigment\n\n- For Color (B):\n  - Dominant (B): Any genotype with B (BB, Bb, ...) \u2192 Brown Color\n  - Recessive (bb): Checkered Color\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Thus, the phenotype is a combination of both.\n\nPhenotype categories:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Checkered Red\n2. C present, B absent: Checkered Brown\n3. C absent, B present: Plain Brown\n4. Neither C nor B present: Plain Red\n\nNow, counting each category:\n\n1. Checkered Red: Genotypes where C and B are both present: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 genotypes\n2. Checkered Brown: Genotype CC bb \u2192 1 genotype\n3. Plain Brown: Genotypes cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n4. Plain Red: Genotype cc bb \u2192 1 genotype\n\nTotal genotypes: 9, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Brown : Plain Red = 4 : 1 : 2 : 1\n\nSimplifying, dividing by the greatest common divisor (which is 1), we get 4:1:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" That doesn't align with my calculation. Option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which also doesn't fit. Option F says \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which sums to 16, whereas the total is 9. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n- Checkered Brown: CC bb \u2192 1\n- Plain Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nYes, that adds up to 8, but there are 9 genotypes. Oh, wait, I missed one. Let me see: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. That's 9. So the phenotypic ratio should sum to 9.\n\nWait, but according to my previous analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 4:1:2:1, adding up to 8, which contradicts the 9 total. So perhaps I made a mistake in categorization. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to look at the number of each phenotype based on the combined dominance of both traits.\n\nEach individual will display a phenotype based on the presence of C and B.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C and B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 C absent, B present \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 5 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Red: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nAdding up to 8, which still doesn't make sense because there are 9 genotypes. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me list them clearly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nThat's 9, categorized into 4,1,2,1 respectively. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:1:2:1. Now, looking at the answer choices, none exactly match this. The closest is option J, which says 2,6,3,1. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the phenotype isn't purely additive but follows a different logic. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation combines the traits differently.\n\nAnother approach is to use the Punnett square method. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have all combinations where each gene is segregating independently.\n\nUsing a Punnett square, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n```\n      B    b\nC     CB  cB\nc     cB  cc\n```\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n```\n    Bb   Bb\ncc    cc\n```\n\nNo, that's not correct either. Let me think of it properly. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes either C/B or c/b. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nAs previously, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4\n- Checkered Brown: 1\n- Plain Brown: 2\n- Plain Red: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:1:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, I don't see an exact match. The closest is option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which doesn't add up to 12, but perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question and need to reevaluate. Another possibility is that the F2 generation refers to the number of offspring after two generations, but perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation relative to the parents, but that doesn't change the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where the parents are both heterozygous for both genes, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio in the F2 generation. But in this case, the parents are not both heterozygous; one is homozygous dominant, and the other is homozygous recessive. Therefore, the F2 won't follow a simple 9:3:3:1 ratio but instead follow the rules outlined above.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 4:1:2:1, which corresponds to Checkered Red:Checkered Brown:Plain Brown:Plain Red = 4:1:2:1. None of the options perfectly reflect this, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption G: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2013 Doesn't make sense as total is 16.\n\nOption J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 Total is 12.\n\nOption F: \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2013 Total is 16.\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 Doesn't align.\n\nPerhaps I need to revisit my calculations. Wait, I realize now that when the F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. Cc BB (25%)\n5. Cc Bb (25%)\n6. Cc bb (25%)\n7. cc BB (25%)\n8. cc Bb (25%)\n9. cc bb (25%)\n\nAs previously, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red\n2. Checkered Brown\n3. Checkered Red\n4. Checkered Red\n5. Checkered Brown\n6. Checkered Red\n7. Plain Brown\n8. Plain Brown\n9. Plain Red\n\nCounting:\n\n- Checkered Red: Cases 1,2,3,4,6 \u2192 5 cases\n- Checkered Brown: Case 5 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Red: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nHmm, that gives 5:1:2:1, which is still inconsistent with the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to a particular phenotype",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently. So the actual F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSo the combination would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because each gene is segregating independently, the F2 would have the product of the probabilities for each gene. So the probability for each combination is (probability for C) \u00d7 (probability for B).\n\nGene C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nGene B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are combinations where each gene's probability multiplies. For example:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nSimilarly,\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nAnd finally,\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypes, we need to map the genotypes to the traits. Let's define the traits based on the given alleles:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant): Red\n  - c (recessive): Checkered\n  \n- Color (B):\n  - B (dominant): Brown\n  - b (recessive): Checkered\n  \nThe phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for both genes. However, the dominance hierarchy may matter here. For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with C will have red pigment, regardless of the color trait (B or b). Similarly, for color, B is dominant over b.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by c, and plain by recessive. So the color patterns depend on the alleles present. The phenotype depends on whether the bird is checkered (c) or plain (B), and if it's plain, whether it's brown (B) or checkered (b). So the order of importance might be pigment color (C) > color (B), or vice versa?\n\nLet me clarify the dominance hierarchy. For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with C will have red pigment. For color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with B will have brown color. The interaction between these would determine the final phenotype. However, the exact order isn't specified, so perhaps we assume that the dominant pigment color takes precedence. That is, if a bird has C (red pigment), it will display red color regardless of its color trait (B or b). If it doesn't have C, then it looks at B\u2014if it has B, it's brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is that the color trait (B/b) is expressed only when the pigment color (C) is not present. But without explicit instructions, it's safer to assume that the dominant pigment color (C) is the primary trait, and thus, any bird with C will be red, regardless of color. Only those without C will look at the color trait (B or b).\n\nGiven that, let's proceed accordingly.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If C is present: red (regardless of B or b)\n- If C is absent: then look at B:\n  - If B is present: brown\n  - If B is absent: checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 population.\n\nTotal F2 population: 16 (since each of the four genes has two possibilities, leading to 2^4 = 16)\n\nBreakdown by genotype:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird (6.25% of 16)\n- CC Bb: 2 (12.5%)\n- CC bb: 1 (6.25%)\n- Cc BB: 2 (12.5%)\n- Cc Bb: 4 (25%)\n- Cc bb: 2 (12.5%)\n- cc BB: 1 (6.25%)\n- cc Bb: 2 (12.5%)\n- cc bb: 1 (6.25%)\n\nNow, convert these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CC Bb: red\n- CC bb: checkered\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: checkered\n- cc BB: red\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nCounting each:\n\nRed phenotypes: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), cc BB (1) \u2192 total 1+2+2+1=6\n\nCheckered phenotypes: CC bb (1), Cc bb (2), cc Bb (2), cc bb (1) \u2192 total 1+2+2+1=6\n\nBrown phenotypes: only Cc Bb (4)\n\nWait, but earlier calculation shows that there are 4 birds with Cc Bb. But according to our breakdown, Cc Bb is brown. Are there any other birds with brown? No, because other than Cc Bb, all others either have C (red) or do not have C and have B (brown) or do not have B and do not have C (checkered). Wait, but according to our breakdown, Cc Bb is brown, and that's the only bird with B, so brown count is 4.\n\nWait, but let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Red: 6 (from 6.25% of 16)\n- Brown: 4 (from 25% of 16)\n- Checkered: 10 (from 6.25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 37.5%, which is 6.25*4=25%; 12.5*3=37.5; 6.25=37.5; 12.5=37.5; adding up to 125% \u2192 12.5% per category? Wait, confusion arises. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to sum all the non-red and non-checkered phenotypes, which are brown.\n\nFrom the list above:\n\nOnly Cc Bb is brown.\n\nSo brown: 4\n\nCheckered: All other birds except Cc Bb and Cc bb (if any). Wait, let me re-examine the breakdown.\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CC Bb: red\n- CC bb: checkered\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: checkered\n- cc BB: red\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nSo red: 1 (CC BB) + 2 (CC Bb) + 2 (Cc BB) + 1 (cc BB) = 6\n\nCheckered: 1 (CC bb) + 2 (Cc bb) + 2 (cc Bb) + 1 (cc bb) = 6\n\nBrown: only 4 (Cc Bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nRed : Brown : Checkered = 6 : 4 : 10\n\nBecause 6 + 4 + 10 = 20, but wait, 6+4=10, plus 10 makes 20?

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently. So the actual F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSo the combination would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because each gene is segregating independently, the F2 would have the product of the probabilities for each gene. So the probability for each combination is (probability for C) \u00d7 (probability for B).\n\nGene C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nGene B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are combinations where each gene's probability multiplies. For example:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nSimilarly,\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nAnd finally,\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypes, we need to map the genotypes to the traits. Let's define the traits based on the given alleles:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant): Red\n  - c (recessive): Checkered\n  \n- Color (B):\n  - B (dominant): Brown\n  - b (recessive): Checkered\n  \nThe phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for both genes. However, the dominance hierarchy may matter here. For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with C will have red pigment, regardless of the color trait (B or b). Similarly, for color, B is dominant over b.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by c, and plain by recessive. So the color patterns depend on the alleles present. The phenotype depends on whether the bird is checkered (c) or plain (B), and if it's plain, whether it's brown (B) or checkered (b). So the order of importance might be pigment color (C) > color (B), or vice versa?\n\nLet me clarify the dominance hierarchy. For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with C will have red pigment. For color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with B will have brown color. The interaction between these would determine the final phenotype. However, the exact order isn't specified, so perhaps we assume that the dominant pigment color takes precedence. That is, if a bird has C (red pigment), it will display red color regardless of its color trait (B or b). If it doesn't have C, then it looks at B\u2014if it has B, it's brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is that the color trait (B/b) is expressed only when the pigment color (C) is not present. But without explicit instructions, it's safer to assume that the dominant pigment color (C) is the primary trait, and thus, any bird with C will be red, regardless of color. Only those without C will look at the color trait (B or b).\n\nGiven that, let's proceed accordingly.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If C is present: red (regardless of B or b)\n- If C is absent: then look at B:\n  - If B is present: brown\n  - If B is absent: checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 population.\n\nTotal F2 population: 16 (since each of the four genes has two possibilities, leading to 2^4 = 16)\n\nBreakdown by genotype:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird (6.25% of 16)\n- CC Bb: 2 (12.5%)\n- CC bb: 1 (6.25%)\n- Cc BB: 2 (12.5%)\n- Cc Bb: 4 (25%)\n- Cc bb: 2 (12.5%)\n- cc BB: 1 (6.25%)\n- cc Bb: 2 (12.5%)\n- cc bb: 1 (6.25%)\n\nNow, convert these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CC Bb: red\n- CC bb: checkered\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: checkered\n- cc BB: red\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nCounting each:\n\nRed phenotypes: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), cc BB (1) \u2192 total 1+2+2+1=6\n\nCheckered phenotypes: CC bb (1), Cc bb (2), cc Bb (2), cc bb (1) \u2192 total 1+2+2+1=6\n\nBrown phenotypes: only Cc Bb (4)\n\nWait, but earlier calculation shows that there are 4 birds with Cc Bb. But according to our breakdown, Cc Bb is brown. Are there any other birds with brown? No, because other than Cc Bb, all others either have C (red) or do not have C and have B (brown) or do not have B and do not have C (checkered). Wait, but according to our breakdown, Cc Bb is brown, and that's the only bird with B, so brown count is 4.\n\nWait, but let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Red: 6 (from 6.25% of 16)\n- Brown: 4 (from 25% of 16)\n- Checkered: 10 (from 6.25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 37.5%, which is 6.25*4=25%; 12.5*3=37.5; 6.25=37.5; 12.5=37.5; adding up to 125% \u2192 12.5% per category? Wait, confusion arises. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to sum all the non-red and non-checkered phenotypes, which are brown.\n\nFrom the list above:\n\nOnly Cc Bb is brown.\n\nSo brown: 4\n\nCheckered: All other birds except Cc Bb and Cc bb (if any). Wait, let me re-examine the breakdown.\n\nIn the F2:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CC Bb: red\n- CC bb: checkered\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: checkered\n- cc BB: red\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nSo red: 1 (CC BB) + 2 (CC Bb) + 2 (Cc BB) + 1 (cc BB) = 6\n\nCheckered: 1 (CC bb) + 2 (Cc bb) + 2 (cc Bb) + 1 (cc bb) = 6\n\nBrown: only 4 (Cc Bb)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nRed : Brown : Checkered = 6 : 4 : 10\n\nBecause 6 + 4 + 10 = 20, but wait, 6+4=10, plus 10 makes 20? Wait, 6+4=10, plus 10=20? No, that can't be because 6+4=10, plus 10 would be 20, but the total F2 is 16 birds. So something's wrong here.\n\nAh, I see the mistake now. In my initial breakdown, I incorrectly counted some categories. Let me redo the counts properly.\n\nEach genotype contributes to a certain phenotype:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- CC Bb: red\n- CC bb: checkered\n- Cc BB: red\n- Cc Bb: brown\n- Cc bb: checkered\n- cc BB: red\n- cc Bb: checkered\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\nRed: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (2), cc BB (1) \u2192 Total 1+2+2+1=6\n\nCheckered: CC bb (1), Cc bb (2), cc Bb (2), cc bb (1) \u2192 Total 1+2+2+1=6\n\nBrown: only Cc Bb (4)\n\nSo total phenotypes:\n\nRed: 6\n\nBrown: 4\n\nCheckered: 6\n\nAdding up: 6+4+6=16, which matches the total.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 6:4:6, which simplifies to 3:2:3 (dividing each by 2).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6 \u2192 6 red, 2 brown, 6 checkered \u2192 Not matching\nOption B: 6, 4, 6 \u2192 Correct\nOption C: 9, 3, 3 \u2192 Incorrect\nOption D: 2, 6, 3 \u2192 No\nOption E: 3, 9, 1 \u2192 No\nOption F: 4, 4, 4 \u2192 No\nOption G: 12, 2, 2 \u2192 No\nOption H: 5, 3, 2 \u2192 No\nOption I: 7, 5, 1 \u2192 No\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor each genotype:\n- CC (red) \u2192 depends on B: if B is present (i.e., BB or Bb), then brown; else checkered.\nWait, the dominance hierarchy is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both alleles. If the bird is CC, regardless of B, it's red. If it's Cc, it's still red (since C is dominant). Similarly, if it's cc, it's plain. As for the B locus, if the bird has at least one B allele (i.e., BB or Bb), it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nSo let's apply this to each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both dominant alleles, so brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both dominant, so brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n4. CC bb (wait, same as above, so another checkered bird)\nWait, but F2 is all four genotypes: 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb? Wait no, earlier assumption was wrong. Wait, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations of the alleles. So let's list them properly:\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%): both C and B dominant \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb (25%): C dominant, B present \u2192 brown\n- CC bb (25%): C dominant, b recessive \u2192 checkered\n- CC bb (another 25%) \u2192 same as above\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: the F2 population consists of four equally likely genotypes due to independent assortment, each being a combination of the alleles from the parents.\n\nSo the four F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%): B is present \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb (25%): B is present \u2192 brown\n- CC bb (25%): b recessive \u2192 checkered\n- CC bb (another 25%) \u2192 same as above\nWait, that's five categories, but there are only four possible genotypes. Actually, each bird's genotype is determined by the alleles from each parent. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F2 genotype possibilities are:\n\n- CC (for gene C) combined with BB (for gene B) \u2192 CC BB\n- CC combined with Bb \u2192 CC Bb\n- CC combined with bb \u2192 CC bb\n- cc combined with BB \u2192 cc BB\n- cc combined with Bb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cc combined with bb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut wait, each parent contributes one allele per gene. So for gene C, each parent contributes either C or c. For gene B, each parent contributes either B or b. Since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will have four possible genotypes for each gene, leading to 4x4=16 possible combinations. But given that both parents are homozygous, some combinations won't occur. Specifically, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC (25%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n- BB (25%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 genotypes for each bird are combinations of these. However, the F2 population will include all possible combinations, each with a certain frequency. But since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow Mendelian inheritance, so each combination will have a specific proportion.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's consider that each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C, each parent contributes either C or c. Since both parents are CC and cc respectively, the F2 will have 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. Similarly for gene B, each parent contributes either B or b, so F2 will have 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes for each bird are combinations of these. However, for our purposes, we're interested in the phenotypes, which depend on both genes.\n\nLet me make a table for all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (25%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 red\n   - B dominant \u2192 brown\n   - Phenotype: Brown\n\n2. CC Bb (25%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 red\n   - B present \u2192 brown\n   - Phenotype: Brown\n\n3. CC bb (25%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 red\n   - b recessive \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered\n\n4. CC bb (another 25%) \u2192 same as above.\n\nWait, but this seems like multiple birds with the same phenotype. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the F2 population is structured. Perhaps each bird is represented once, so the four F2 genotypes each have 25% frequency. But considering independent assortment, the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (another 25%) \u2192 total of five, but that's impossible. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's approach this differently.\n\nEach gene follows a simple Mendelian model, so the F2 for each gene is independent. Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThe F2 population will have all combinations of these. However, since each bird has two alleles for each gene, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSame for gene B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 genotypes for each bird are the product of these probabilities. But for the purpose of calculating phenotypes, we need to look at each bird's combination of alleles.\n\nHowever, this could get complicated. Instead, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of birds in each phenotype category. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the possible phenotypes and their contributions:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered (only occurs when B is recessive, i.e., bb)\n\nPhenotype 2: Brown (occurs when B is present, i.e., Bb or BB)\n\nPhenotype 3: Red (occurs when C is present, i.e., CC or Cc)\n\nBut wait, since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will be red, unless B is also recessive (i.e., bb).\n\nWait, no. Because the phenotype is determined by both genes. If the bird is CC (C dominant), and B is present (Bb or BB), it's brown. If it's CC and bb, it's checkered. If it's Cc (any C), even if B is recessive (bb), it's red. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc (so at least one C), and B is recessive (bb), then the phenotype is red. Because C is dominant over c, so regardless of B, if the bird has C, it's red.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele (i.e., CC or Cc), it's red, regardless of B.\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (i.e., BB or Bb), it's brown.\n\n- Only if the bird has neither C nor B alleles (i.e., cc bb) does it stay plain.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes and their conditions:\n\n1. Checkered (cc bb): Always plain, regardless of B.\n\n2. Brown (Bb or BB): Occur when B is present, regardless of C.\n\n3. Red (Cc or cc): Wait, no. Because C is dominant, any bird with at least one C (i.e., CC or Cc) is red. So, except for checkered (cc) and plain (cc bb), all others are red.\n\nWait, but let me re-express:\n\nIf the bird has at least one C allele, it's red. Whether or not it has B alleles, it's red. So, checkered is only when it has no C alleles (cc) and no B alleles (bb). Brown is when it has C alleles but no B alleles (CC or Cc). Red is when it has C alleles but may have B alleles (BB, Bb, Cc, etc.).\n\nWait, no. Because if it has C alleles, it's always red, regardless of B. So:\n\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 plain.\n\n- Brown (BB, Bb, ccBb?) Wait, no, checkered is cc, so brown must have B present (Bb or BB). Red must have C present (Cc or cc). Wait, no, red includes all cases where C is present, including when B is present or not.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let's structure this clearly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of C determines whether the bird is red or plain. The presence of B determines whether the bird is brown or checkered.\n\nSo:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C allele):\n\n  - If B is present (at least one B allele): Brown\n\n  - If B is absent (both alleles B are recessive): Plain\n\n- If C is absent (both alleles C are recessive):\n\n  - If B is present (at least one B allele): Checkered\n\n  - If B is absent (both alleles B are recessive): Plain\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 only when both alleles are recessive (c and c) and B is recessive (b and b). So phenotype is checkered.\n\n- Brown (Bb or BB) \u2192 when C is present (CC or Cc) and B is present (Bb or BB). Note that when C is absent (cc), B determines the phenotype: Bb or BB \u2192 brown; cc \u2192 plain.\n\n- Red (Cc or cc) \u2192 when C is present (CC or Cc) and B is either present (Bb or BB) or absent (but since C is present, the B condition isn't directly relevant. Wait, no\u2014because C being present makes it red regardless of B. So:\n\n  - If C is present (CC or Cc), the bird is red, regardless of B. So:\n\n    - If B is present (Bb or BB): Brown\n\n    - If B is absent (bb): Checkered\n\n  - If C is absent (cc), then:\n\n    - If B is present (Bb or BB): Checkered\n\n    - If B is absent (bb): Plain\n\nTherefore, the breakdown is:\n\n1. Checkered (cc bb): Always plain.\n\n2. Brown (Bb or BB): When C is present (CC or Cc) and B is present (Bb or BB).\n\n3. Red (Cc or cc): When C is present (CC or Cc), regardless of B. So:\n\n   - Cc and Bb \u2192 Brown\n\n   - Cc and bb \u2192 Red\n\n   - cc and Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n   - cc and bb \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, but according to the rules, if C is present, it's red. So all cases where C is present are red, regardless of B. So, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- All birds with at least one C allele are red.\n\n- Among those, if they have at least one B allele (Bb or BB), they are brown.\n\n- If they have no B alleles (bb), they are checkered.\n\nAdditionally, any bird without C alleles (cc) will have their phenotype determined by B:\n\n- If they have at least one B allele (Bb or BB), they are brown.\n\n- If they have no B alleles (bb), they are plain.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Checkered (cc): Only when both alleles are recessive and B is recessive \u2192 phenotype: checkered.\n\n- Brown (Bb or BB): When C is present (CC or Cc) and B is present (Bb or BB).\n\n- Red (Cc or cc): When C is present (CC or Cc), regardless of B. This includes:\n\n   - Cc and Bb \u2192 Brown\n\n   - Cc and bb \u2192 Red\n\n   - cc and Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n   - cc and bb \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, but according to the previous breakdown, red includes all cases where C is present, regardless of B. So, all birds with at least one C allele are red. So, among the red birds, half will have B present (brown) and half will have B absent (checkered). Similarly, among the non-red birds (cc), half will have B present (brown) and half will have B absent (checkered).\n\nWait, but that leads to:\n\n- Total red birds = (number of C present) = (CC and Cc)\n\n- Of those, (B present) = (Bb and BB) \u2192 brown\n\n- Of those, (B absent) = (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\n- Non-red birds = (cc)\n\n  - Of those, (B present) = (Bb and BB) \u2192 brown\n\n  - Of those, (B absent) = (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered: (cc and bb) \u2192 total 25%\n\n- Brown: (cc and Bb/BB) \u2192 50%\n\n- Red: (cc and cc) \u2192 25%?\n\nWait, no. Let me compute the exact percentages.\n\nTotal possible genotypes in F2:\n\nFor gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo, the F2 population has 16 possible combinations of these alleles, but considering independence, the actual F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Checkered (duplicate, so actually 25% CC bb)\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me instead use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation.\n\nThe parents are Cc BB and cc bb.\n\nParent 1 (Cc BB) can only produce CB gametes.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.\n\nThus, F1 will have 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% CB, 25% cb. Wait, no, each parent produces one gamete, so F1 is 25% CB and 25% cb.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.\n\nEach parent can produce either CB or cb gametes (assuming 50% chance each). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n\n- CB + cb \u2192 CC Bb (25%)\n\n- cb + CB \u2192 CC Bb (25%)\n\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this results in three distinct genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n\n3. cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, checking the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (phenotype 3)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown (phenotype 2)\n\n3. cc bb \u2192 Plain (phenotype 1)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered: 25%\n\n- Brown: 25%\n\n- Red: 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because according to the options provided, none of them have a 25% checkered. Let me review my reasoning.\n\nAh! I see the confusion now. My mistake was thinking that the F2 genotypes are only the four I listed, but in reality, each bird is represented once in the Punnett square, so the phenotypes are determined by the combination of alleles passed from each parent.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to realize that each bird inherits one allele from each parent, so the F2 will have the following possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the alleles are inherited independently, the F2 genotypes will combine these. However, when determining phenotypes, we'll consider each bird's combination of alleles:\n\n- If the bird is CC (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Red\n\n- If the bird is Cc (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Red\n\n- If the bird is cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, counting the number of birds in each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered: Only when both alleles are recessive (cc and bb). From the above, the only way to get checkered is when the bird is cc and bb, which occurs in 25% of the F2 population.\n\n- Brown: Any bird that has at least one C allele and at least one B allele. From the above, this happens when the bird is CC (red) and BB, Bb, or Cc (all red and brown), or when the bird is Cc and Bb, Bb, or bb (all red and brown). Additionally, when the bird is cc and Bb or BB (red and brown). And when the bird is cc and bb (checkered). So, excluding checkered, the remaining are brown.\n\nWait, but let's count:\n\nTotal F2: 100%\n\nCheckered: ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, since both parents are homozygous, the actual F2 genotypes might differ. Alternatively, considering that F1 is CcBb, the gametes would indeed be CB and cb, each at 50%. Thus, F2 would have four genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). Now, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor each genotype:\n- CC (red) \u2192 depends on B: if B is present (i.e., BB or Bb), then brown; else checkered.\nWait, the dominance hierarchy is such that C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both alleles. If the bird is CC, regardless of B, it's red. If it's Cc, it's still red (since C is dominant). Similarly, if it's cc, it's plain. As for the B locus, if the bird has at least one B allele (i.e., BB or Bb), it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nSo let's apply this to each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both dominant alleles, so brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both dominant, so brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n4. CC bb (wait, same as above, so another checkered bird)\nWait, but F2 is all four genotypes: 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb? Wait no, earlier assumption was wrong. Wait, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations of the alleles. So let's list them properly:\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%): both C and B dominant \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb (25%): C dominant, B present \u2192 brown\n- CC bb (25%): C dominant, b recessive \u2192 checkered\n- CC bb (another 25%) \u2192 same as above\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: the F2 population consists of four equally likely genotypes due to independent assortment, each being a combination of the alleles from the parents.\n\nSo the four F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%): B is present \u2192 brown\n- CC Bb (25%): B is present \u2192 brown\n- CC bb (25%): b recessive \u2192 checkered\n- CC bb (another 25%) \u2192 same as above\nWait, that's five categories, but there are only four possible genotypes. Actually, each bird's genotype is determined by the alleles from each parent. Since each parent contributes one allele for each gene, the F2 genotype possibilities are:\n\n- CC (for gene C) combined with BB (for gene B) \u2192 CC BB\n- CC combined with Bb \u2192 CC Bb\n- CC combined with bb \u2192 CC bb\n- cc combined with BB \u2192 cc BB\n- cc combined with Bb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cc combined with bb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut wait, each parent contributes one allele per gene. So for gene C, each parent contributes either C or c. For gene B, each parent contributes either B or b. Since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will have four possible genotypes for each gene, leading to 4x4=16 possible combinations. But given that both parents are homozygous, some combinations won't occur. Specifically, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC (25%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n- BB (25%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 genotypes for each bird are combinations of these. However, the F2 population will include all possible combinations, each with a certain frequency. But since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow Mendelian inheritance, so each combination will have a specific proportion.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's consider that each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for gene C, each parent contributes either C or c. Since both parents are CC and cc respectively, the F2 will have 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. Similarly for gene B, each parent contributes either B or b, so F2 will have 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes for each bird are combinations of these. However, for our purposes, we're interested in the phenotypes, which depend on both genes.\n\nLet me make a table for all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (25%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 red\n   - B dominant \u2192 brown\n   - Phenotype: Brown\n\n2. CC Bb (25%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 red\n   - B present \u2192 brown\n   - Phenotype: Brown\n\n3. CC bb (25%):\n   - C dominant \u2192 red\n   - b recessive \u2192 checkered\n   - Phenotype: Checkered\n\n4. CC bb (another 25%) \u2192 same as above.\n\nWait, but this seems like multiple birds with the same phenotype. That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the F2 population is structured. Perhaps each bird is represented once, so the four F2 genotypes each have 25% frequency. But considering independent assortment, the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (another 25%) \u2192 total of five, but that's impossible. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's approach this differently.\n\nEach gene follows a simple Mendelian model, so the F2 for each gene is independent. Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nThe F2 population will have all combinations of these. However, since each bird has two alleles for each gene, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSame for gene B:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 genotypes for each bird are the product of these probabilities. But for the purpose of calculating phenotypes, we need to look at each bird's combination of alleles.\n\nHowever, this could get complicated. Instead, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of birds in each phenotype category. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the possible phenotypes and their contributions:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered (only occurs when B is recessive, i.e., bb)\n\nPhenotype 2: Brown (occurs when B is present, i.e., Bb or BB)\n\nPhenotype 3: Red (occurs when C is present, i.e., CC or Cc)\n\nBut wait, since C is dominant, any bird with at least one C allele will be red, unless B is also recessive (i.e., bb).\n\nWait, no. Because the phenotype is determined by both genes. If the bird is CC (C dominant), and B is present (Bb or BB), it's brown. If it's CC and bb, it's checkered. If it's Cc (any C), even if B is recessive (bb), it's red. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc (so at least one C), and B is recessive (bb), then the phenotype is red. Because C is dominant over c, so regardless of B, if the bird has C, it's red.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C allele (i.e., CC or Cc), it's red, regardless of B.\n\n- If the bird has at least one B allele (i.e., BB or Bb), it's brown.\n\n- Only if the bird has neither C nor B alleles (i.e., cc bb) does it stay plain.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes and their conditions:\n\n1. Checkered (cc bb): Always plain, regardless of B.\n\n2. Brown (Bb or BB): Occur when B is present, regardless of C.\n\n3. Red (Cc or cc): Wait, no. Because C is dominant, any bird with at least one C (i.e., CC or Cc) is red. So, except for checkered (cc) and plain (cc bb), all others are red.\n\nWait, but let me re-express:\n\nIf the bird has at least one C allele, it's red. Whether or not it has B alleles, it's red. So, checkered is only when it has no C alleles (cc) and no B alleles (bb). Brown is when it has C alleles but no B alleles (CC or Cc). Red is when it has C alleles but may have B alleles (BB, Bb, Cc, etc.).\n\nWait, no. Because if it has C alleles, it's always red, regardless of B. So:\n\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 plain.\n\n- Brown (BB, Bb, ccBb?) Wait, no, checkered is cc, so brown must have B present (Bb or BB). Red must have C present (Cc or cc). Wait, no, red includes all cases where C is present, including when B is present or not.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let's structure this clearly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of C determines whether the bird is red or plain. The presence of B determines whether the bird is brown or checkered.\n\nSo:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C allele):\n\n  - If B is present (at least one B allele): Brown\n\n  - If B is absent (both alleles B are recessive): Plain\n\n- If C is absent (both alleles C are recessive):\n\n  - If B is present (at least one B allele): Checkered\n\n  - If B is absent (both alleles B are recessive): Plain\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 only when both alleles are recessive (c and c) and B is recessive (b and b). So phenotype is checkered.\n\n- Brown (Bb or BB) \u2192 when C is present (CC or Cc) and B is present (Bb or BB). Note that when C is absent (cc), B determines the phenotype: Bb or BB \u2192 brown; cc \u2192 plain.\n\n- Red (Cc or cc) \u2192 when C is present (CC or Cc) and B is either present (Bb or BB) or absent (but since C is present, the B condition isn't directly relevant. Wait, no\u2014because C being present makes it red regardless of B. So:\n\n  - If C is present (CC or Cc), the bird is red, regardless of B. So:\n\n    - If B is present (Bb or BB): Brown\n\n    - If B is absent (bb): Checkered\n\n  - If C is absent (cc), then:\n\n    - If B is present (Bb or BB): Checkered\n\n    - If B is absent (bb): Plain\n\nTherefore, the breakdown is:\n\n1. Checkered (cc bb): Always plain.\n\n2. Brown (Bb or BB): When C is present (CC or Cc) and B is present (Bb or BB).\n\n3. Red (Cc or cc): When C is present (CC or Cc), regardless of B. So:\n\n   - Cc and Bb \u2192 Brown\n\n   - Cc and bb \u2192 Red\n\n   - cc and Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n   - cc and bb \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, but according to the rules, if C is present, it's red. So all cases where C is present are red, regardless of B. So, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- All birds with at least one C allele are red.\n\n- Among those, if they have at least one B allele (Bb or BB), they are brown.\n\n- If they have no B alleles (bb), they are checkered.\n\nAdditionally, any bird without C alleles (cc) will have their phenotype determined by B:\n\n- If they have at least one B allele (Bb or BB), they are brown.\n\n- If they have no B alleles (bb), they are plain.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Checkered (cc): Only when both alleles are recessive and B is recessive \u2192 phenotype: checkered.\n\n- Brown (Bb or BB): When C is present (CC or Cc) and B is present (Bb or BB).\n\n- Red (Cc or cc): When C is present (CC or Cc), regardless of B. This includes:\n\n   - Cc and Bb \u2192 Brown\n\n   - Cc and bb \u2192 Red\n\n   - cc and Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n   - cc and bb \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, but according to the previous breakdown, red includes all cases where C is present, regardless of B. So, all birds with at least one C allele are red. So, among the red birds, half will have B present (brown) and half will have B absent (checkered). Similarly, among the non-red birds (cc), half will have B present (brown) and half will have B absent (checkered).\n\nWait, but that leads to:\n\n- Total red birds = (number of C present) = (CC and Cc)\n\n- Of those, (B present) = (Bb and BB) \u2192 brown\n\n- Of those, (B absent) = (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\n- Non-red birds = (cc)\n\n  - Of those, (B present) = (Bb and BB) \u2192 brown\n\n  - Of those, (B absent) = (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered: (cc and bb) \u2192 total 25%\n\n- Brown: (cc and Bb/BB) \u2192 50%\n\n- Red: (cc and cc) \u2192 25%?\n\nWait, no. Let me compute the exact percentages.\n\nTotal possible genotypes in F2:\n\nFor gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSo, the F2 population has 16 possible combinations of these alleles, but considering independence, the actual F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered\n\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Checkered (duplicate, so actually 25% CC bb)\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me instead use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation.\n\nThe parents are Cc BB and cc bb.\n\nParent 1 (Cc BB) can only produce CB gametes.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.\n\nThus, F1 will have 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% CB, 25% cb. Wait, no, each parent produces one gamete, so F1 is 25% CB and 25% cb.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.\n\nEach parent can produce either CB or cb gametes (assuming 50% chance each). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n\n- CB + cb \u2192 CC Bb (25%)\n\n- cb + CB \u2192 CC Bb (25%)\n\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this results in three distinct genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n\n3. cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, checking the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (phenotype 3)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown (phenotype 2)\n\n3. cc bb \u2192 Plain (phenotype 1)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered: 25%\n\n- Brown: 25%\n\n- Red: 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because according to the options provided, none of them have a 25% checkered. Let me review my reasoning.\n\nAh! I see the confusion now. My mistake was thinking that the F2 genotypes are only the four I listed, but in reality, each bird is represented once in the Punnett square, so the phenotypes are determined by the combination of alleles passed from each parent.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to realize that each bird inherits one allele from each parent, so the F2 will have the following possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the alleles are inherited independently, the F2 genotypes will combine these. However, when determining phenotypes, we'll consider each bird's combination of alleles:\n\n- If the bird is CC (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Red\n\n- If the bird is Cc (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Red\n\n- If the bird is cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Brown\n\n- If the bird is cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, counting the number of birds in each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered: Only when both alleles are recessive (cc and bb). From the above, the only way to get checkered is when the bird is cc and bb, which occurs in 25% of the F2 population.\n\n- Brown: Any bird that has at least one C allele and at least one B allele. From the above, this happens when the bird is CC (red) and BB, Bb, or Cc (all red and brown), or when the bird is Cc and Bb, Bb, or bb (all red and brown). Additionally, when the bird is cc and Bb or BB (red and brown). And when the bird is cc and bb (checkered). So, excluding checkered, the remaining are brown.\n\nWait, but let's count:\n\nTotal F2: 100%\n\nCheckered: ",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance and recessiveness, some phenotypes might overlap.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance and recessiveness, some phenotypes might overlap. But perhaps the user expects us to use the standard Punnett square without worrying too much about dominance hierarchy beyond the given letters.\n\nWait, no, actually, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 would be CcBb, as each allele is present once. Then, when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). But wait, that doesn't account for dominance. Alternatively, maybe the F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb, leading to F2 genotypes as:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nBut then, what phenotypes do these correspond to?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered = recessive (so cc)\n- Plain = dominant (CC)\n- Pigmentation = dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n- Pigmentation = recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nColor phenotype depends on both C/c and B/b. So, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nSo, for example, if a bird is CC (checkered) and BB (brown), it would be checkered brown. If CC (checkered) and bb (checkered), it would be checkered checkered. Similarly, CC (checkered) and Bb (brown) would be checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly, for Cc (pigment brown) and Bb (brown), it would be brown brown. And Cc (pigment brown) and bb (checkered) would be brown checkered. And cc (checkered) and anything (as bb is already covered), but wait, let's structure this properly.\n\nThe possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- CC (dominant, red)\n- Cc (dominant, red)\n- cc (recessive, plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n- BB (dominant, brown)\n- Bb (dominant, brown)\n- bb (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the phenotypes combine as follows:\n\n- Checkered (cc) + Brown (BB or Bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Checkered (cc) + Brown (BB/Bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Checkered (cc) + Checkered (bb) \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- Plain (CC) + Brown (BB/Bb) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Plain (CC) + Checkered (bb) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n- Pigmented (Cc) + Brown (BB/Bb) \u2192 Pigmented Brown\n- Pigmented (Cc) + Checkered (bb) \u2192 Pigmented Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb) would have the following probabilities:\n\nEach trait segregates independently. So, for pigment:\n\n- CC : 25%\n- Cc : 50%\n- cc : 25%\n\nFor color:\n\n- BB : 25%\n- Bb : 50%\n- bb : 25%\n\nCombining these:\n\nTotal phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB or Bb)\n   - Probability: 25% (cc) * 25% (BB or Bb) = 6.25%?\nWait, no. Because for each trait, the segregation is independent, so the combined probability is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability for each trait separately, then multiply them.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the traits are independent. So the combined probabilities are calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to create a table showing all combinations.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nPossible genotypes for color:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nEach combination of pigment and color occurs with a probability equal to the product of the individual probabilities. So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: cc (25%) * BB (25%) = 6.25%? Wait, no, because the order matters. Actually, for the F2 generation, each bird is determined by the combination of pigment and color, so the probability of being Checkered Brown is indeed (25% for cc) multiplied by (25% for BB) = 6.25%.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none have 6.25%, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes, but let's proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations where each trait is considered separately. But the actual number of possible phenotypes isn't simply additive because some combinations may lead to the same phenotype. For example, a bird could be Checkered Brown or Plain Brown depending on the color. Similarly, Pigmented Brown vs. Pigmented Checkered.\n\nSo, the total phenotypic ratio would require calculating how many birds fall into each category.\n\nLet me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, each bird's genotype is a combination of these two traits. The phenotype combines both, so we'll have nine possible combinations, but some may lead to the same phenotype.\n\nPhenotype categories:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB)\n2. Checkered Brown (cc Bb)\n3. Checkered Brown (cc bb)? Wait, no, because bb leads to checkered. So:\n\nCheckered Brown \u2192 cc (regardless of color)\nCheckered Blue? Wait, blue is represented by bb, so no. Wait, in the problem, the alleles are B and b for color. So, any bird with bb will be checkered regardless of pigment.\n\nSimilarly, brown is represented by BB or Bb, while plain is CC.\n\nSo, checking each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB or BB) \u2192 Phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n2. Checkered Blue (but wait, blue is bb, so any bird with bb will be checkered, so this is redundant).\n3. Checkered Checkered (cc bb) \u2192 Phenotype is Checkered Checkered.\n4. Plain Brown (CC BB or Bb BB) \u2192 Phenotype is Plain Brown.\n5. Plain Blue (CC bb) \u2192 Phenotype is Plain Blue (but blue is represented by bb, so this is redundant).\n6. Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB) \u2192 Phenotype is Pigmented Brown.\n7. Pigmented Blue (Cc bb) \u2192 Phenotype is Pigmented Blue (but blue is represented by bb, so this is redundant).\n\nTherefore, the distinct phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown\n- Checkered Checkered\n- Plain Brown\n- Pigmented Brown\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, we'll need to calculate the probabilities for each combination of pigment and color.\n\nUsing a Punnett square approach, considering the independent assortment of two genes:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So, the probability of each pigment and color combination is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (probability of cc) * (probability of BB or Bb) = 25% * (25% + 50%) = 25% * 75% = 18.75%?\nWait, no. That's not quite right because the color and pigment are independent. Wait, pigment and color are independent traits, so the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having a certain phenotype is the product of the probability of that phenotype for pigment and the probability for color.\n\nSo, for example, the probability of being Checkered Brown is:\n\nP(checkered) * P(brown) = 25% * 75% = 18.75%.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Checkered Brown (cc BB) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Checkered Brown (cc Bb) \u2192 Same as above \u2192 18.75%\n- Checkered Brown (cc bb) \u2192 Not applicable, because bb is checkered, not brown.\nWait, no, because the color for bb is checkered, so any bird with bb is Checkered, not Brown. Therefore, the only brown phenotype is when both pigment and color are present as brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: A bird is brown if it has at least one dominant B allele (i.e., BB or Bb), and checkered if it has both recessive alleles (cc). So, the brown phenotype requires at least one B allele, and the checkered phenotype requires both alleles to be c.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both pigment and color are recessive \u2192 Checkered Checkered (cc bb)\n2. Pigmented (at least one C) and color is recessive (cc) \u2192 Checkered Brown (cc BB or Bb)\n3. Pigmented (at least one C) and color is dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 Plain Brown (CC BB or Bb BB)\n4. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Plain Brown (CC BB or Bb BB)\n5. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB)\n6. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB)\n7. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB)\n8. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB)\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach this differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of its two traits:\n\n- Pigmented (C): presence (dominant) or absence (recessive)\n- Color (B): presence (dominant) or absence (recessive)\n\nThe phenotype combines these:\n\n- If both are absent (cc bb) \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- If pigment is present (CC or Cc) and color is absent (bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If pigment is present (CC or Cc) and color is present (BB or Bb) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- If both are present \u2192 Pigmented Brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Checkered\n2. Checkered Brown\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Pigmented Brown\n\nNow, let's compute the frequency for each:\n\n1. Checkered Checkered (cc bb): Probability = P(cc) * P(bb) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown (cc BB or Bb): Probability = P(cc) * [P(BB) + P(Bb)] = 25% * (25% + 50%) = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n3. Plain Brown (CC BB or Bb BB): Probability = P(CC) * [P(BB) + P(Bb)] = 25% * (25% + 50%) = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n4. Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB): Probability = P(Cc) * [P(BB) + P(Bb)] = 50% * 75% = 37.5%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 37.5% = 75%, which accounts for all possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts based on the F2 generation size. Since the F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross (F1 \u00d7 F1), the expected ratios are:\n\n- Checkered Checkered: 1/16\n- Checkered Brown: 2/16 (since 18.75% is approximately 1/5.55, but exact calculation is needed)\n- Plain Brown: 2/16\n- Pigmented Brown: 4/16 (since 37.5% is exactly 3/16, but wait, 37.5% is 3/8, which is 6/16)\n\nWait, let's get exact numbers. The total percentage is 75%, so each phenotype contributes:\n\n- Checkered Checkered: 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n- Checkered Brown: 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Pigmented Brown: 37.5% \u2192 6/16\n\nWait, adding these: 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 13, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's wrong. Let me recalculate the percentages more precisely.\n\nUsing exact values:\n\n- Checkered Checkered: 25% (cc) * 25% (bb) = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n- Checkered Brown: 25% (cc) * 75% (BB or Bb) = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 25% (CC) * 75% (BB or Bb) = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Pigmented Brown: 50% (Cc) * 75% (BB or Bb) = 37.5% \u2192 6/16\n\nTotal: 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 13 parts out of 16, which suggests a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps I missed the fact that each F2 bird has 4 possible genotypes, but the phenotypes reduce due to dominance. Let me reconsider the Punnett square approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes, then count the phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 population consists of 16 possible genotypes, each with a specific phenotype based on dominance:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered Brown\nCC Bb | Checkered Brown\nCC bb | Checkered Checkered\nCC BB | Checkered Brown\nCC Bb | Checkered Brown\nCC bb | Checkered Checkered\nCc BB | Pigmented Brown\nCc Bb | Pigmented Brown\nCc bb | Pigmented Checkered\ncc BB | Checkered Brown\ncc Bb | Checkered Brown\ncc bb | Checkered Checkered\ncc BB | Checkered Brown\ncc Bb | Checkered Brown\ncc bb | Checkered Checkered\n... Wait, this seems tedious. Instead, perhaps a better approach is to note that the phenotypic ratio corresponds to the squares of the Mendelian ratios.\n\nGiven that the F2 generation is derived from a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio should follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but when considering dominance, it becomes 9 (Checkered Brown) : 3 (Plain Brown) : 3 (Pigmented Brown) : 1 (Checkered Checkered). But this assumes that all three traits are expressed equally, which isn't the case here. In our problem, checkering and brownness are separate traits, so the phenotypic ratio is more like 25% Checkered Brown, 25% Checkered Checkered, 25% Plain Brown, and 25% Pigmented Brown. Wait, but that contradicts earlier calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the Punnett square correctly. Let me construct the F2 grid properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. Each parent contributes either CB or cb. So, the F2 will have four possible gametes:\n\n- CB (from CC BB parent)\n- cb (from CC BB parent)\n- cb (from cc BB parent)\n- cb (from cc BB parent)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The F1 is CcBb, so it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, and cb. Wait, but that's not right because each parent contributes one allele. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: Cc Bb (genetic code: C c B b)\nParent 2: cc bb (genetic code: c c b b)\n\nSo, for each gene, the F1 produces:\n\n- For pigment (C/c): C or c (50% each)\n- For color (B/b): B or b (50% each)\n\nThus, F2 will have 16 possible genotype combinations, with each gene segregating independently.\n\nHowever, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two traits. To simplify, let's look at each trait separately and see how they combine.\n\nThe F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio if all four phenotypes were expressed equally, but in reality, some phenotypes are merged (e.g., checkered and brown). This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it by considering that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of its two traits. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB or BB)\n2. Checkered Checkered (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (CC BB or BB)\n4. Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or BB)\n\nWait, no, because a bird with cc will always be checkered, regardless of color. So:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB or BB)\n2. Checkered Checkered (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (CC BB or BB)\n4. Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or BB)\n\nBut wait, this leads to four phenotypes, each with different probabilities. However, in reality, some phenotypes might be the same, especially when multiple traits are expressed.\n\nBut according to the problem, the phenotypes are Checkered Brown, plain brown, etc., which implies that each bird's phenotype is uniquely determined by both traits. So, the four phenotypes are distinct based on the combination of pigment and color.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance and recessiveness, some phenotypes might overlap. But perhaps the user expects us to use the standard Punnett square without worrying too much about dominance hierarchy beyond the given letters.\n\nWait, no, actually, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 would be CcBb, as each allele is present once. Then, when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), and bb (25%). But wait, that doesn't account for dominance. Alternatively, maybe the F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb, leading to F2 genotypes as:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nBut then, what phenotypes do these correspond to?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered = recessive (so cc)\n- Plain = dominant (CC)\n- Pigmentation = dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n- Pigmentation = recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nColor phenotype depends on both C/c and B/b. So, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nSo, for example, if a bird is CC (checkered) and BB (brown), it would be checkered brown. If CC (checkered) and bb (checkered), it would be checkered checkered. Similarly, CC (checkered) and Bb (brown) would be checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly, for Cc (pigment brown) and Bb (brown), it would be brown brown. And Cc (pigment brown) and bb (checkered) would be brown checkered. And cc (checkered) and anything (as bb is already covered), but wait, let's structure this properly.\n\nThe possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- CC (dominant, red)\n- Cc (dominant, red)\n- cc (recessive, plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n- BB (dominant, brown)\n- Bb (dominant, brown)\n- bb (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the phenotypes combine as follows:\n\n- Checkered (cc) + Brown (BB or Bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Checkered (cc) + Brown (BB/Bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Checkered (cc) + Checkered (bb) \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- Plain (CC) + Brown (BB/Bb) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Plain (CC) + Checkered (bb) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n- Pigmented (Cc) + Brown (BB/Bb) \u2192 Pigmented Brown\n- Pigmented (Cc) + Checkered (bb) \u2192 Pigmented Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb) would have the following probabilities:\n\nEach trait segregates independently. So, for pigment:\n\n- CC : 25%\n- Cc : 50%\n- cc : 25%\n\nFor color:\n\n- BB : 25%\n- Bb : 50%\n- bb : 25%\n\nCombining these:\n\nTotal phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB or Bb)\n   - Probability: 25% (cc) * 25% (BB or Bb) = 6.25%?\nWait, no. Because for each trait, the segregation is independent, so the combined probability is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability for each trait separately, then multiply them.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the traits are independent. So the combined probabilities are calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to create a table showing all combinations.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nPossible genotypes for color:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nEach combination of pigment and color occurs with a probability equal to the product of the individual probabilities. So:\n\n- Checkered Brown: cc (25%) * BB (25%) = 6.25%? Wait, no, because the order matters. Actually, for the F2 generation, each bird is determined by the combination of pigment and color, so the probability of being Checkered Brown is indeed (25% for cc) multiplied by (25% for BB) = 6.25%.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none have 6.25%, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes, but let's proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations where each trait is considered separately. But the actual number of possible phenotypes isn't simply additive because some combinations may lead to the same phenotype. For example, a bird could be Checkered Brown or Plain Brown depending on the color. Similarly, Pigmented Brown vs. Pigmented Checkered.\n\nSo, the total phenotypic ratio would require calculating how many birds fall into each category.\n\nLet me approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, each bird's genotype is a combination of these two traits. The phenotype combines both, so we'll have nine possible combinations, but some may lead to the same phenotype.\n\nPhenotype categories:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB)\n2. Checkered Brown (cc Bb)\n3. Checkered Brown (cc bb)? Wait, no, because bb leads to checkered. So:\n\nCheckered Brown \u2192 cc (regardless of color)\nCheckered Blue? Wait, blue is represented by bb, so no. Wait, in the problem, the alleles are B and b for color. So, any bird with bb will be checkered regardless of pigment.\n\nSimilarly, brown is represented by BB or Bb, while plain is CC.\n\nSo, checking each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB or BB) \u2192 Phenotype is Checkered Brown.\n2. Checkered Blue (but wait, blue is bb, so any bird with bb will be checkered, so this is redundant).\n3. Checkered Checkered (cc bb) \u2192 Phenotype is Checkered Checkered.\n4. Plain Brown (CC BB or Bb BB) \u2192 Phenotype is Plain Brown.\n5. Plain Blue (CC bb) \u2192 Phenotype is Plain Blue (but blue is represented by bb, so this is redundant).\n6. Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB) \u2192 Phenotype is Pigmented Brown.\n7. Pigmented Blue (Cc bb) \u2192 Phenotype is Pigmented Blue (but blue is represented by bb, so this is redundant).\n\nTherefore, the distinct phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown\n- Checkered Checkered\n- Plain Brown\n- Pigmented Brown\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, we'll need to calculate the probabilities for each combination of pigment and color.\n\nUsing a Punnett square approach, considering the independent assortment of two genes:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So, the probability of each pigment and color combination is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Checkered Brown: (probability of cc) * (probability of BB or Bb) = 25% * (25% + 50%) = 25% * 75% = 18.75%?\nWait, no. That's not quite right because the color and pigment are independent. Wait, pigment and color are independent traits, so the probability of a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having a certain phenotype is the product of the probability of that phenotype for pigment and the probability for color.\n\nSo, for example, the probability of being Checkered Brown is:\n\nP(checkered) * P(brown) = 25% * 75% = 18.75%.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Checkered Brown (cc BB) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Checkered Brown (cc Bb) \u2192 Same as above \u2192 18.75%\n- Checkered Brown (cc bb) \u2192 Not applicable, because bb is checkered, not brown.\nWait, no, because the color for bb is checkered, so any bird with bb is Checkered, not Brown. Therefore, the only brown phenotype is when both pigment and color are present as brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: A bird is brown if it has at least one dominant B allele (i.e., BB or Bb), and checkered if it has both recessive alleles (cc). So, the brown phenotype requires at least one B allele, and the checkered phenotype requires both alleles to be c.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both pigment and color are recessive \u2192 Checkered Checkered (cc bb)\n2. Pigmented (at least one C) and color is recessive (cc) \u2192 Checkered Brown (cc BB or Bb)\n3. Pigmented (at least one C) and color is dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 Plain Brown (CC BB or Bb BB)\n4. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Plain Brown (CC BB or Bb BB)\n5. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB)\n6. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB)\n7. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB)\n8. Pigmented and color is dominant \u2192 Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB)\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach this differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of its two traits:\n\n- Pigmented (C): presence (dominant) or absence (recessive)\n- Color (B): presence (dominant) or absence (recessive)\n\nThe phenotype combines these:\n\n- If both are absent (cc bb) \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- If pigment is present (CC or Cc) and color is absent (bb) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If pigment is present (CC or Cc) and color is present (BB or Bb) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- If both are present \u2192 Pigmented Brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Checkered\n2. Checkered Brown\n3. Plain Brown\n4. Pigmented Brown\n\nNow, let's compute the frequency for each:\n\n1. Checkered Checkered (cc bb): Probability = P(cc) * P(bb) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown (cc BB or Bb): Probability = P(cc) * [P(BB) + P(Bb)] = 25% * (25% + 50%) = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n3. Plain Brown (CC BB or Bb BB): Probability = P(CC) * [P(BB) + P(Bb)] = 25% * (25% + 50%) = 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n4. Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or Bb BB): Probability = P(Cc) * [P(BB) + P(Bb)] = 50% * 75% = 37.5%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 37.5% = 75%, which accounts for all possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts based on the F2 generation size. Since the F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross (F1 \u00d7 F1), the expected ratios are:\n\n- Checkered Checkered: 1/16\n- Checkered Brown: 2/16 (since 18.75% is approximately 1/5.55, but exact calculation is needed)\n- Plain Brown: 2/16\n- Pigmented Brown: 4/16 (since 37.5% is exactly 3/16, but wait, 37.5% is 3/8, which is 6/16)\n\nWait, let's get exact numbers. The total percentage is 75%, so each phenotype contributes:\n\n- Checkered Checkered: 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n- Checkered Brown: 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Pigmented Brown: 37.5% \u2192 6/16\n\nWait, adding these: 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 13, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's wrong. Let me recalculate the percentages more precisely.\n\nUsing exact values:\n\n- Checkered Checkered: 25% (cc) * 25% (bb) = 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n- Checkered Brown: 25% (cc) * 75% (BB or Bb) = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain Brown: 25% (CC) * 75% (BB or Bb) = 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Pigmented Brown: 50% (Cc) * 75% (BB or Bb) = 37.5% \u2192 6/16\n\nTotal: 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 13 parts out of 16, which suggests a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps I missed the fact that each F2 bird has 4 possible genotypes, but the phenotypes reduce due to dominance. Let me reconsider the Punnett square approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes, then count the phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 population consists of 16 possible genotypes, each with a specific phenotype based on dominance:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered Brown\nCC Bb | Checkered Brown\nCC bb | Checkered Checkered\nCC BB | Checkered Brown\nCC Bb | Checkered Brown\nCC bb | Checkered Checkered\nCc BB | Pigmented Brown\nCc Bb | Pigmented Brown\nCc bb | Pigmented Checkered\ncc BB | Checkered Brown\ncc Bb | Checkered Brown\ncc bb | Checkered Checkered\ncc BB | Checkered Brown\ncc Bb | Checkered Brown\ncc bb | Checkered Checkered\n... Wait, this seems tedious. Instead, perhaps a better approach is to note that the phenotypic ratio corresponds to the squares of the Mendelian ratios.\n\nGiven that the F2 generation is derived from a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio should follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but when considering dominance, it becomes 9 (Checkered Brown) : 3 (Plain Brown) : 3 (Pigmented Brown) : 1 (Checkered Checkered). But this assumes that all three traits are expressed equally, which isn't the case here. In our problem, checkering and brownness are separate traits, so the phenotypic ratio is more like 25% Checkered Brown, 25% Checkered Checkered, 25% Plain Brown, and 25% Pigmented Brown. Wait, but that contradicts earlier calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the Punnett square correctly. Let me construct the F2 grid properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. Each parent contributes either CB or cb. So, the F2 will have four possible gametes:\n\n- CB (from CC BB parent)\n- cb (from CC BB parent)\n- cb (from cc BB parent)\n- cb (from cc BB parent)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The F1 is CcBb, so it can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, and cb. Wait, but that's not right because each parent contributes one allele. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: Cc Bb (genetic code: C c B b)\nParent 2: cc bb (genetic code: c c b b)\n\nSo, for each gene, the F1 produces:\n\n- For pigment (C/c): C or c (50% each)\n- For color (B/b): B or b (50% each)\n\nThus, F2 will have 16 possible genotype combinations, with each gene segregating independently.\n\nHowever, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two traits. To simplify, let's look at each trait separately and see how they combine.\n\nThe F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio if all four phenotypes were expressed equally, but in reality, some phenotypes are merged (e.g., checkered and brown). This complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it by considering that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of its two traits. So, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB or BB)\n2. Checkered Checkered (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (CC BB or BB)\n4. Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or BB)\n\nWait, no, because a bird with cc will always be checkered, regardless of color. So:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB or BB)\n2. Checkered Checkered (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (CC BB or BB)\n4. Pigmented Brown (Cc BB or BB)\n\nBut wait, this leads to four phenotypes, each with different probabilities. However, in reality, some phenotypes might be the same, especially when multiple traits are expressed.\n\nBut according to the problem, the phenotypes are Checkered Brown, plain brown, etc., which implies that each bird's phenotype is uniquely determined by both traits. So, the four phenotypes are distinct based on the combination of pigment and color.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\n1.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

Let me clarify. Each parent contributes either CB or cb. So when F1 (CcBb) crosses, each gamete is either CB or cb.

Let me approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each trait. So for pigment color (B):\n\n- If B is present (either B or B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b or b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nFor pigment pattern (C):\n\n- If C is present (C or C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c or c_), the bird is plain.\n\nTherefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these traits. To get the phenotypic ratio, we'll need to determine how many birds in the F2 generation exhibit each phenotype.\n\nLet me list all the F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Both B and C are dominant \u2192 Brown, Red \u2192 Checkered, Red?\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- For pigment color (B):\n  - B_: Brown\n  - b_: Checkered\n- For pigment pattern (C):\n  - C_: Red\n  - c_: Plain\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Brown and Red \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Brown and Plain \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- Checkered and Red \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Checkered and Plain \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nBecause:\n\n- Brown (B_) overrides the pattern, unless the pattern is also present (e.g., checkered).\n- Plain (c_) overrides the color unless the color is also present (e.g., red).\n\nWait, that might not be entirely accurate. Actually, if a bird has both dominant traits, they express them. So:\n\n- Brown and Red \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Brown and Plain \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- Checkered and Red \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Checkered and Plain \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nIs that correct? Hmm, yes, I think that's how dominance works in genetics. If a bird has both dominant alleles for both traits, it will display both. So, the phenotypes are determined by the highest level of dominance first.\n\nNow, mapping this to our F2 genotypes:\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. **CC BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n2. **CC Bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n3. **CC bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n4. **Cc BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n5. **Cc Bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n6. **Cc bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n7. **cc BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n8. **cc Bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n9. **cc bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nWait, hold on. That doesn't seem right. Because in F2, the possible phenotypes depend on the combination of the two traits. But according to the above analysis, all F2 individuals would have either Checkered, Red or Checkered, Plain. Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotype for some genotypes.\n\nLet me go through each genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**:\n   - B_: Brown (since B is dominant)\n   - C_: Red (since C is dominant)\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n2. **CC Bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n3. **CC bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n4. **Cc BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n5. **Cc Bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n6. **Cc bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n7. **cc BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n8. **cc Bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n9. **cc bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nWait, now looking at this, it seems like only two phenotypes emerge: Checkered, Red and Checkered, Plain. That can\u2019t be right because the options given include various ratios, so something must be wrong here.\n\nAh, I realize my mistake! I incorrectly assumed that both C and B are dominant. But wait, in reality, the dominance hierarchy matters, but the way the problem is presented, both C and B are dominant for their respective traits, which affects the phenotypes.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the order. Let me re-express the rules:\n\nFor pigment color (B):\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive b \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor pigment pattern (C):\n- Dominant C \u2192 Red\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, with the highest priority being the dominant trait.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible combinations:\n\n1. **CC BB**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n2. **CC Bb**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n3. **CC bb**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n4. **Cc BB**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n5. **Cc Bb**\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n6. **Cc bb**\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n7. **cc BB**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n8. **cc Bb**\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n9. **cc bb**\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nHmm, so all these birds end up with either Checkered, Red or Checkered, Plain. That means the phenotypic ratio is 2:1, with Checkered, Red being twice as common as Checkered, Plain. Looking at the answer choices, option D says Checkered red:1, plain red:3, but that doesn't match our conclusion. Alternatively, none of the options seem to fit. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the B and C traits interact such that having both dominant alleles results in the most severe phenotype. But in this case, since both traits are expressed fully, it still ends up as Checkered, Red.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none directly match this scenario. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 6:4:2:4 \u2013 Not matching\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 Not matching\nD. 1:3:1:3 \u2013 No\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 All same\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2013 No\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2013 No\nK. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 All same\nL. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 No\nM. 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No\nN. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No\nO. 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No\nP. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Yes!\n\nWait, P is 6:2:6:2, which would correspond to Checkered Red:Checkered Plain:Checkered Red:Checkered Plain. Wait, that's exactly what I got earlier. So the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, but in terms of frequency, it's three Checkered Reds and three Checkered Plains, making a total of six birds, with two Checkered Reds and four Checkered Plains? Wait, no. Let me recount.\n\nActually, in the F2 generation, there are 9 birds in total (as per the Punnett square), each contributing to the next generation. Each bird's phenotype is determined as follows:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (1 bird)\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (1 bird)\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (1 bird)\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n\nSo adding them up: Checkered, Red occurs in 4 birds (CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB, and another?), wait no. Wait, CC BB is 1 bird, Cc BB is another, cc BB is another. Wait, CC BB is 25%, so 1 bird, Cc BB is 25% \u2192 1 bird, cc BB is 25% \u2192 1 bird, totaling 3 birds of Checkered, Red. Similarly, the rest (CC Bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb, etc.) are 25% each, so 2 birds of Checkered, Plain. Wait, no, that can't add up.\n\nWait, let me count properly:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- CC Bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- CC bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- Cc BB: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Cc Bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- Cc bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- cc BB: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- cc Bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- cc bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered, Red: 3 birds (from CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB)\n- Checkered, Plain: 6 birds (from CC Bb, CC bb, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, no, that adds up to 3+6=9 birds. So the phenotypic ratio is 3 Checkered, Red : 6 Checkered, Plain, which simplifies to 1:2. But none of the options match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 phenotypes.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps the F2 genotypes have different phenotypes. Let me consider each possible genotype again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (phenotype X)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (phenotype Y)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (X)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (X)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n\nSo among these 9 birds, 3 are X (Checkered, Red) and 6 are Y (Checkered, Plain). Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:6, or simplified to 1:2.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption K: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 No, that's 9:3:3:1, which isn't our case.\n\nOption P: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Wait, that's a different ratio where each category has 2 birds. Our calculation shows 3 of one type and 6 of another, so Option P doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of each phenotype. Let me try again.\n\nTotal F2 population after selfing: 9 birds.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Checkered, Red: 3 birds (from CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB)\n- Checkered, Plain: 6 birds (from CC Bb, CC bb, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:6, which simplifies to 1:2. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:2. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 This would mean 6 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Plain, 6 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Plain. That totals 16 birds, which is more than our 9. So A is unlikely.\n\nB. 6:4:4:4 \u2192 No, because 6+4+4+4=18, too much.\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Again, total 16, not matching.\n\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 No.\n\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\n\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question states: \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene c; plain color is determined by the recessive allele.\" Wait, hold on. Wait, the description said: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, that's conflicting because in standard genetics, the recessive allele is 'c' and the dominant is 'C'. So perhaps there was a typo. Let me parse the original problem again.\n\nIn the problem statement: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So that suggests that 'c' is the dominant allele for plain, and 'C' is the recessive for red. Wait, that's the opposite of standard notation. Normally, the capital letters are dominant, lowercase recessive. So perhaps in this case, 'C' is the dominant for red, and 'c' is dominant for plain. That changes everything.\n\nWait, that's crucial. So let me redefine:\n\n- Pigmented Color:\n  - Red: dominant allele C\n  - Plain: recessive allele c\n\n- Pattern:\n  - Brown: dominant allele B\n  - Checkered: recessive allele b\n\nSo, in this case, the dominance hierarchy is inverted. So, for example, if an individual has at least one C allele, they are red, even if they have a b allele. Conversely, if they have any c alleles, they are plain, regardless of B or b.\n\nThis completely changes the analysis. So let's redo the phenotypic determination based on this new understanding.\n\nPhenotype determination rules under this inverted dominance:\n\n- Pigmented Color:\n  - Dominant C \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n\n- Pattern:\n  - Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for both traits. Let me reassess the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nGiven the F2 genotypes from the previous analysis (which were the same as before, except the definitions of dominance are swapped), but the actual phenotypes change because the dominance relationships are reversed. So:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both pigmented and pattern.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes and resulting phenotypes:\n\n1. **CC BB**\n   - Pigmented: C_ \u2192 Red\n   - Pattern: B_ \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Red, Brown\n\n2. **CC Bb**\n   - Pigmented: C_ \u2192 Red\n   - Pattern: B_ \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Red, Brown\n\n3. **CC bb**\n   - Pigmented: C_ \u2192 Red\n   - Pattern: b_ \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Red, Checkered\n\n4. **Cc BB**\n   - Pigmented: C_ \u2192 Red\n   - Pattern: B_ \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Red, Brown\n\n5. **Cc",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the actual outcome depends on whether the genes assort independently. In this case, I think they do. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all dominant)\n- 25% CC Bb (heterozygous dominant)\n- 25% cc BB (all recessive for C, but dominant for B)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Let me clarify. Each parent contributes either CB or cb. So when F1 (CcBb) crosses, each gamete is either CB or cb. So the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nBut the question mentions checking for phenotype ratios, so let's map phenotypes to genotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigmentation (B/b): dominant B = brown, recessive b = checkered\n- Pigment Pattern (C/c): dominant C = red, recessive c = plain\n\nThus, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- If B is present (B_), then brown if C is present (C_), else checkered.\n- If b is present (b_), then checkered regardless of C.\n- Similarly, if C is present (C_), then red if B is present (B_), else plain.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me approach it differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles for each trait. So for pigment color (B):\n\n- If B is present (either B or B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b or b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nFor pigment pattern (C):\n\n- If C is present (C or C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c or c_), the bird is plain.\n\nTherefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of these traits. To get the phenotypic ratio, we'll need to determine how many birds in the F2 generation exhibit each phenotype.\n\nLet me list all the F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Both B and C are dominant \u2192 Brown, Red \u2192 Checkered, Red?\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- For pigment color (B):\n  - B_: Brown\n  - b_: Checkered\n- For pigment pattern (C):\n  - C_: Red\n  - c_: Plain\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Brown and Red \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Brown and Plain \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- Checkered and Red \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Checkered and Plain \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nBecause:\n\n- Brown (B_) overrides the pattern, unless the pattern is also present (e.g., checkered).\n- Plain (c_) overrides the color unless the color is also present (e.g., red).\n\nWait, that might not be entirely accurate. Actually, if a bird has both dominant traits, they express them. So:\n\n- Brown and Red \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Brown and Plain \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- Checkered and Red \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Checkered and Plain \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nIs that correct? Hmm, yes, I think that's how dominance works in genetics. If a bird has both dominant alleles for both traits, it will display both. So, the phenotypes are determined by the highest level of dominance first.\n\nNow, mapping this to our F2 genotypes:\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. **CC BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n2. **CC Bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n3. **CC bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n4. **Cc BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n5. **Cc Bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n6. **Cc bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n7. **cc BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n8. **cc Bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n9. **cc bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nWait, hold on. That doesn't seem right. Because in F2, the possible phenotypes depend on the combination of the two traits. But according to the above analysis, all F2 individuals would have either Checkered, Red or Checkered, Plain. Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the phenotype for some genotypes.\n\nLet me go through each genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**:\n   - B_: Brown (since B is dominant)\n   - C_: Red (since C is dominant)\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n2. **CC Bb**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n3. **CC bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n4. **Cc BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n5. **Cc Bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n6. **Cc bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n7. **cc BB**:\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n8. **cc Bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n9. **cc bb**:\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nWait, now looking at this, it seems like only two phenotypes emerge: Checkered, Red and Checkered, Plain. That can\u2019t be right because the options given include various ratios, so something must be wrong here.\n\nAh, I realize my mistake! I incorrectly assumed that both C and B are dominant. But wait, in reality, the dominance hierarchy matters, but the way the problem is presented, both C and B are dominant for their respective traits, which affects the phenotypes.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the order. Let me re-express the rules:\n\nFor pigment color (B):\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive b \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor pigment pattern (C):\n- Dominant C \u2192 Red\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, with the highest priority being the dominant trait.\n\nLet me create a table of all possible combinations:\n\n1. **CC BB**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n2. **CC Bb**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n3. **CC bb**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n4. **Cc BB**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - C_: Red\n   \u2192 Checkered, Red\n\n5. **Cc Bb**\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n6. **Cc bb**\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n7. **cc BB**\n   - B_: Brown\n   - c_: Plain\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n8. **cc Bb**\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\n9. **cc bb**\n   - Same as above\n   \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nHmm, so all these birds end up with either Checkered, Red or Checkered, Plain. That means the phenotypic ratio is 2:1, with Checkered, Red being twice as common as Checkered, Plain. Looking at the answer choices, option D says Checkered red:1, plain red:3, but that doesn't match our conclusion. Alternatively, none of the options seem to fit. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the B and C traits interact such that having both dominant alleles results in the most severe phenotype. But in this case, since both traits are expressed fully, it still ends up as Checkered, Red.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none directly match this scenario. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 6:4:2:4 \u2013 Not matching\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 Not matching\nD. 1:3:1:3 \u2013 No\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 All same\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2013 No\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2013 No\nK. 4:4:4:4 \u2013 All same\nL. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 No\nM. 12:2:2:0 \u2013 No\nN. 5:3:2:6 \u2013 No\nO. 3:9:1:3 \u2013 No\nP. 6:2:6:2 \u2013 Yes!\n\nWait, P is 6:2:6:2, which would correspond to Checkered Red:Checkered Plain:Checkered Red:Checkered Plain. Wait, that's exactly what I got earlier. So the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, but in terms of frequency, it's three Checkered Reds and three Checkered Plains, making a total of six birds, with two Checkered Reds and four Checkered Plains? Wait, no. Let me recount.\n\nActually, in the F2 generation, there are 9 birds in total (as per the Punnett square), each contributing to the next generation. Each bird's phenotype is determined as follows:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (1 bird)\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% CC bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (1 bird)\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (1 bird)\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (1 bird)\n\nSo adding them up: Checkered, Red occurs in 4 birds (CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB, and another?), wait no. Wait, CC BB is 1 bird, Cc BB is another, cc BB is another. Wait, CC BB is 25%, so 1 bird, Cc BB is 25% \u2192 1 bird, cc BB is 25% \u2192 1 bird, totaling 3 birds of Checkered, Red. Similarly, the rest (CC Bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb, etc.) are 25% each, so 2 birds of Checkered, Plain. Wait, no, that can't add up.\n\nWait, let me count properly:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- CC Bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- CC bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- Cc BB: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- Cc Bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- Cc bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- cc BB: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Red\n- cc Bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n- cc bb: 1 bird \u2192 Checkered, Plain\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered, Red: 3 birds (from CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB)\n- Checkered, Plain: 6 birds (from CC Bb, CC bb, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nWait, no, that adds up to 3+6=9 birds. So the phenotypic ratio is 3 Checkered, Red : 6 Checkered, Plain, which simplifies to 1:2. But none of the options match this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 phenotypes.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps the F2 genotypes have different phenotypes. Let me consider each possible genotype again:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (phenotype X)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (phenotype Y)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (X)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered, Red (X)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered, Plain (Y)\n\nSo among these 9 birds, 3 are X (Checkered, Red) and 6 are Y (Checkered, Plain). Thus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:6, or simplified to 1:2.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption K: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 No, that's 9:3:3:1, which isn't our case.\n\nOption P: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Wait, that's a different ratio where each category has 2 birds. Our calculation shows 3 of one type and 6 of another, so Option P doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of each phenotype. Let me try again.\n\nTotal F2 population after selfing: 9 birds.\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Checkered, Red: 3 birds (from CC BB, Cc BB, cc BB)\n- Checkered, Plain: 6 birds (from CC Bb, CC bb, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc Bb, cc bb)\n\nSo the ratio is 3:6, which simplifies to 1:2. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:2. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 This would mean 6 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Plain, 6 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Plain. That totals 16 birds, which is more than our 9. So A is unlikely.\n\nB. 6:4:4:4 \u2192 No, because 6+4+4+4=18, too much.\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Again, total 16, not matching.\n\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 No.\n\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 No.\n\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question states: \"the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene c; plain color is determined by the recessive allele.\" Wait, hold on. Wait, the description said: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, that's conflicting because in standard genetics, the recessive allele is 'c' and the dominant is 'C'. So perhaps there was a typo. Let me parse the original problem again.\n\nIn the problem statement: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So that suggests that 'c' is the dominant allele for plain, and 'C' is the recessive for red. Wait, that's the opposite of standard notation. Normally, the capital letters are dominant, lowercase recessive. So perhaps in this case, 'C' is the dominant for red, and 'c' is dominant for plain. That changes everything.\n\nWait, that's crucial. So let me redefine:\n\n- Pigmented Color:\n  - Red: dominant allele C\n  - Plain: recessive allele c\n\n- Pattern:\n  - Brown: dominant allele B\n  - Checkered: recessive allele b\n\nSo, in this case, the dominance hierarchy is inverted. So, for example, if an individual has at least one C allele, they are red, even if they have a b allele. Conversely, if they have any c alleles, they are plain, regardless of B or b.\n\nThis completely changes the analysis. So let's redo the phenotypic determination based on this new understanding.\n\nPhenotype determination rules under this inverted dominance:\n\n- Pigmented Color:\n  - Dominant C \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n\n- Pattern:\n  - Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for both traits. Let me reassess the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nGiven the F2 genotypes from the previous analysis (which were the same as before, except the definitions of dominance are swapped), but the actual phenotypes change because the dominance relationships are reversed. So:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both pigmented and pattern.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes and resulting phenotypes:\n\n1. **CC BB**\n   - Pigmented: C_ \u2192 Red\n   - Pattern: B_ \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Red, Brown\n\n2. **CC Bb**\n   - Pigmented: C_ \u2192 Red\n   - Pattern: B_ \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Red, Brown\n\n3. **CC bb**\n   - Pigmented: C_ \u2192 Red\n   - Pattern: b_ \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Red, Checkered\n\n4. **Cc BB**\n   - Pigmented: C_ \u2192 Red\n   - Pattern: B_ \u2192 Brown\n   \u2192 Red, Brown\n\n5. **Cc",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering the actual segregation, since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed.",
    "rollout": " However, considering the actual segregation, since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So the F2 would have four genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B and b.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's if each parent contributes independently. However, in reality, the segregation might differ due to linkage, but the question doesn't mention any linkage, so we'll assume independent assortment. So the F2 would have four genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for each gene separately. Now, looking at the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two genes: C and B. The phenotypes depend on the alleles. Let's list the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC \u2192 red (C dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain (c recessive)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB \u2192 brown (B dominant)\n- bb \u2192 checkered (b recessive)\n\nSo the phenotype for each bird is a combination of both genes. Let's make a table:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 4^2 = 16 (since each gene segregates into 4 categories).\n\nBut wait, according to the previous analysis, each gene has 4 possible phenotypes, leading to 4x4=16 combinations. However, some phenotypes may overlap, especially when the alleles are recessive. But let's proceed methodically.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to calculate the number of each genotype first and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation has the following genotype distribution:\n\n- CC (for Gene C): 25% \u2192 Phenotype: red (since CC \u2192 red)\n- Cc (Gene C): 50% \u2192 Phenotype: red (since C dominant)\n- cc (Gene C): 25% \u2192 Phenotype: plain (since cc \u2192 plain)\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n\n- BB (Gene B): 25% \u2192 Phenotype: brown\n- Bb (Gene B): 50% \u2192 Phenotype: brown\n- bb (Gene B): 25% \u2192 Phenotype: checkered\n\nNow, we need to combine these to get the overall phenotype for each bird. Let's consider all possible combinations:\n\nPossible combinations of Gene C and Gene B:\n\n1. CC (Red) + BB (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. CC + Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC + bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Cc (Red) + BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc + Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n6. Cc + bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc (Plain) + BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc + Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc + bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Only when Gene C is cc and Gene B is bb. Frequency = 25% (Cc) * 25% (bb) = 6.25%\n- Plain Brown: When Gene C is cc and Gene B is Bb. Frequency = 25% (cc) * 50% (Bb) = 12.5%\n- Red Brown: When either Gene C is cc or Cc, and Gene B is Bb. Frequency = (25% + 50%) (C) * 50% (Bb) = 75% * 50% = 37.5%\n- Red Checkered: When Gene C is cc and Gene B is bb. Frequency = 25% (cc) * 25% (bb) = 6.25%\n\nWait, but the options given don't include decimal fractions. They use whole numbers. So perhaps we need to express these as ratios over 16 (total F2 individuals):\n\n- Checkered Brown: 6.25/16 = 1/24 \u2192 approx 0.0417, but in terms of 16, it's 6.25 \u2192 but since we can't have fractions, perhaps the answer uses relative counts without percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options represent the ratios as per 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 6.25 \u2192 6.25\n- Plain Brown: 12.5 \u2192 12.5\n- Red Brown: 37.5 \u2192 37.5\n- Red Checkered: 6.25 \u2192 6.25\n\nBut none of the options seem to match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 which adds up to 18, which is incorrect.\n\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sums to 16, which fits. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sums to 12, which is wrong. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sums to 16, which also fits. Wait, option D is 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nLet me recalculate using absolute numbers:\n\nCheckered Brown: (25% Cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% \u2192 6.25/16 = 0.3906\n\nPlain Brown: (25% cc) * (50% Bb) = 12.5% \u2192 12.5/16 = 0.78125\n\nRed Brown: (25% Cc) * (50% Bb) + (50% Cc) * (50% Bb) = (12.5% + 25%) = 37.5% \u2192 37.5/16 = 2.34375\n\nRed Checkered: (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% \u2192 6.25/16 = 0.3906\n\nWait, but adding these as absolute counts: 6.25 + 12.5 + 37.5 + 6.25 = 62.5, which exceeds 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Instead, I should express the ratios as fractions over 16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the F2 population will have the following distribution based on the independent assortment:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown) [wait, no]\n\nActually, for each gene, the segregation is independent, so the combined phenotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Using a Punnett square for two genes, where each gene segregates independently. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB):\n- Gene C: C (dominant)\n- Gene B: B (dominant)\n\nParent 2 (cc bb):\n- Gene C: c (recessive)\n- Gene B: b (recessive)\n\nF1 (Cc Bb) will produce gametes CB and cb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): C from both parents\n- Cc (50%): C from one parent and c from the other\n- cc (25%): c from both parents\n- bb (25%): b from both parents\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n- bb: brown\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n- bb: brown\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio depends on how many of each genotype exist in the F2 population. Since each gene segregates independently, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nThus:\n\n- CC: red \u2192 25% of total\n- Cc: red \u2192 25% of total\n- cc: plain \u2192 25% of total\n- bb: brown \u2192 25% of total\n\nNow, within each phenotype group, the subphenotypes depend on the alleles for the second gene:\n\n- For red (CC and Cc):\n  - Both C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - Both C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n  - One C and one c \u2192 red brown\n  - One C and one B \u2192 red brown\n  - One C and one b \u2192 red checkered\n  - One c and one B \u2192 red brown\n  - One c and one b \u2192 red checkered\n- For plain (cc):\n  - Both c (recessive) and B (recessive) \u2192 plain brown\n  - Both c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 plain checkered\n  - One c and one B \u2192 plain brown\n  - One c and one b \u2192 plain checkered\n  - One c and one B \u2192 plain brown\n  - One c and one b \u2192 plain checkered\n\nBut to simplify, each F2 individual can be categorized as follows:\n\n- 25%: CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- 25%: CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- 25%: CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- 25%: Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- 25%: Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n- 25%: Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- 25%: cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- 25%: cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- 25%: cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, grouping these:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100% \u2192 Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, CC (red) includes both BB and Bb. Similarly, Cc includes BB, Bb, and bb. And cc includes BB, Bb, and bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014each individual is unique. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nCounting the number of each:\n\n- Red Brown: 4 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Red Checkered: 2 (from CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain Brown: 2 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain Checkered: 1 (from cc bb)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because there are 9 possible F2 individuals (since 3^2 = 9?), but I think I'm mixing things up. Actually, each gene has three possibilities, so F2 has 3 x 3 = 9 possible phenotypes, but some phenotypes repeat across different genotypes.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: occurs when Gene C is dominant (either Cc or CC) AND Gene B is dominant (either BB or Bb). So probability = (probability of C dominant) * (probability of B dominant) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\n- Red Checkered: occurs when Gene C is recessive (cc) AND Gene B is dominant (Bb). Probability = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\n- Plain Brown: occurs when Gene C is recessive (cc) AND Gene B is recessive (bb). Probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\n- Plain Checkered: occurs when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). Probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nAdding these up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 = 8/9 \u2248 88.89%, which leaves 1/9 unaccounted for, likely due to errors in my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nThe probability that Gene C is dominant (C) is 2/3 (since the alleles are CC and Cc, so dominant C is 2/3). Similarly, the probability that Gene B is dominant (B) is 2/3. So the probability of both being dominant is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9. That's for Red Brown.\n\nFor Red Checkered: Gene C must be recessive (cc, which is 1/3 chance), and Gene B must be dominant (Bb, which is 2/3 chance). So (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n\nFor Plain Brown: Gene C is recessive (1/3) and Gene B is recessive (1/3), so (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9.\n\nFor Plain Checkered: same as above, (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9.\n\nNow, summing these: 4/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 = 8/9. Which accounts for most of the population, leaving 1/9 unaccounted. This suggests an error in my reasoning. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that each gene segregates independently, leading to 9 possible phenotypic combinations, but some are overlapping.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual segregation, since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So the F2 would have four genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B and b.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's if each parent contributes independently. However, in reality, the segregation might differ due to linkage, but the question doesn't mention any linkage, so we'll assume independent assortment. So the F2 would have four genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for each gene separately. Now, looking at the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two genes: C and B. The phenotypes depend on the alleles. Let's list the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC \u2192 red (C dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain (c recessive)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB \u2192 brown (B dominant)\n- bb \u2192 checkered (b recessive)\n\nSo the phenotype for each bird is a combination of both genes. Let's make a table:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 4^2 = 16 (since each gene segregates into 4 categories).\n\nBut wait, according to the previous analysis, each gene has 4 possible phenotypes, leading to 4x4=16 combinations. However, some phenotypes may overlap, especially when the alleles are recessive. But let's proceed methodically.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to calculate the number of each genotype first and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation has the following genotype distribution:\n\n- CC (for Gene C): 25% \u2192 Phenotype: red (since CC \u2192 red)\n- Cc (Gene C): 50% \u2192 Phenotype: red (since C dominant)\n- cc (Gene C): 25% \u2192 Phenotype: plain (since cc \u2192 plain)\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n\n- BB (Gene B): 25% \u2192 Phenotype: brown\n- Bb (Gene B): 50% \u2192 Phenotype: brown\n- bb (Gene B): 25% \u2192 Phenotype: checkered\n\nNow, we need to combine these to get the overall phenotype for each bird. Let's consider all possible combinations:\n\nPossible combinations of Gene C and Gene B:\n\n1. CC (Red) + BB (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. CC + Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC + bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Cc (Red) + BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc + Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n6. Cc + bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc (Plain) + BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc + Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc + bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Only when Gene C is cc and Gene B is bb. Frequency = 25% (Cc) * 25% (bb) = 6.25%\n- Plain Brown: When Gene C is cc and Gene B is Bb. Frequency = 25% (cc) * 50% (Bb) = 12.5%\n- Red Brown: When either Gene C is cc or Cc, and Gene B is Bb. Frequency = (25% + 50%) (C) * 50% (Bb) = 75% * 50% = 37.5%\n- Red Checkered: When Gene C is cc and Gene B is bb. Frequency = 25% (cc) * 25% (bb) = 6.25%\n\nWait, but the options given don't include decimal fractions. They use whole numbers. So perhaps we need to express these as ratios over 16 (total F2 individuals):\n\n- Checkered Brown: 6.25/16 = 1/24 \u2192 approx 0.0417, but in terms of 16, it's 6.25 \u2192 but since we can't have fractions, perhaps the answer uses relative counts without percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options represent the ratios as per 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 6.25 \u2192 6.25\n- Plain Brown: 12.5 \u2192 12.5\n- Red Brown: 37.5 \u2192 37.5\n- Red Checkered: 6.25 \u2192 6.25\n\nBut none of the options seem to match exactly. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 which adds up to 18, which is incorrect.\n\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sums to 16, which fits. Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sums to 12, which is wrong. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sums to 16, which also fits. Wait, option D is 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nLet me recalculate using absolute numbers:\n\nCheckered Brown: (25% Cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% \u2192 6.25/16 = 0.3906\n\nPlain Brown: (25% cc) * (50% Bb) = 12.5% \u2192 12.5/16 = 0.78125\n\nRed Brown: (25% Cc) * (50% Bb) + (50% Cc) * (50% Bb) = (12.5% + 25%) = 37.5% \u2192 37.5/16 = 2.34375\n\nRed Checkered: (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25% \u2192 6.25/16 = 0.3906\n\nWait, but adding these as absolute counts: 6.25 + 12.5 + 37.5 + 6.25 = 62.5, which exceeds 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Instead, I should express the ratios as fractions over 16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the F2 population will have the following distribution based on the independent assortment:\n\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 25% Cc (red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown) [wait, no]\n\nActually, for each gene, the segregation is independent, so the combined phenotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Using a Punnett square for two genes, where each gene segregates independently. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB):\n- Gene C: C (dominant)\n- Gene B: B (dominant)\n\nParent 2 (cc bb):\n- Gene C: c (recessive)\n- Gene B: b (recessive)\n\nF1 (Cc Bb) will produce gametes CB and cb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): C from both parents\n- Cc (50%): C from one parent and c from the other\n- cc (25%): c from both parents\n- bb (25%): b from both parents\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n- bb: brown\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n- bb: brown\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio depends on how many of each genotype exist in the F2 population. Since each gene segregates independently, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nThus:\n\n- CC: red \u2192 25% of total\n- Cc: red \u2192 25% of total\n- cc: plain \u2192 25% of total\n- bb: brown \u2192 25% of total\n\nNow, within each phenotype group, the subphenotypes depend on the alleles for the second gene:\n\n- For red (CC and Cc):\n  - Both C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - Both C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n  - One C and one c \u2192 red brown\n  - One C and one B \u2192 red brown\n  - One C and one b \u2192 red checkered\n  - One c and one B \u2192 red brown\n  - One c and one b \u2192 red checkered\n- For plain (cc):\n  - Both c (recessive) and B (recessive) \u2192 plain brown\n  - Both c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 plain checkered\n  - One c and one B \u2192 plain brown\n  - One c and one b \u2192 plain checkered\n  - One c and one B \u2192 plain brown\n  - One c and one b \u2192 plain checkered\n\nBut to simplify, each F2 individual can be categorized as follows:\n\n- 25%: CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- 25%: CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- 25%: CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- 25%: Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- 25%: Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n- 25%: Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- 25%: cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- 25%: cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- 25%: cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, grouping these:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100% \u2192 Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, CC (red) includes both BB and Bb. Similarly, Cc includes BB, Bb, and bb. And cc includes BB, Bb, and bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014each individual is unique. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 red checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain checkered\n\nCounting the number of each:\n\n- Red Brown: 4 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Red Checkered: 2 (from CC bb, Cc bb)\n- Plain Brown: 2 (from cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain Checkered: 1 (from cc bb)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because there are 9 possible F2 individuals (since 3^2 = 9?), but I think I'm mixing things up. Actually, each gene has three possibilities, so F2 has 3 x 3 = 9 possible phenotypes, but some phenotypes repeat across different genotypes.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to calculate the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: occurs when Gene C is dominant (either Cc or CC) AND Gene B is dominant (either BB or Bb). So probability = (probability of C dominant) * (probability of B dominant) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n\n- Red Checkered: occurs when Gene C is recessive (cc) AND Gene B is dominant (Bb). Probability = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n\n- Plain Brown: occurs when Gene C is recessive (cc) AND Gene B is recessive (bb). Probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\n- Plain Checkered: occurs when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). Probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nAdding these up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 = 8/9 \u2248 88.89%, which leaves 1/9 unaccounted for, likely due to errors in my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nThe probability that Gene C is dominant (C) is 2/3 (since the alleles are CC and Cc, so dominant C is 2/3). Similarly, the probability that Gene B is dominant (B) is 2/3. So the probability of both being dominant is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9. That's for Red Brown.\n\nFor Red Checkered: Gene C must be recessive (cc, which is 1/3 chance), and Gene B must be dominant (Bb, which is 2/3 chance). So (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n\nFor Plain Brown: Gene C is recessive (1/3) and Gene B is recessive (1/3), so (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9.\n\nFor Plain Checkered: same as above, (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9.\n\nNow, summing these: 4/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 = 8/9. Which accounts for most of the population, leaving 1/9 unaccounted. This suggests an error in my reasoning. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that each gene segregates independently, leading to 9 possible phenotypic combinations, but some are overlapping. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a Punnett square approach with all possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model the Punnett square for two genes with two alleles each, resulting in 9 possible phenotypic outcomes, each occurring with certain probabilities.\n\nBut given time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the F2 population will have the following phenotypic ratios based on independent assortment:\n\n- Red Brown: 4/9\n- Red Checkered: 2/9\n- Plain Brown: 1/9\n- Plain Checkered: 1/9\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16, but our calculation shows 4:2:1:1, which isn't matching.\n\nOption B: 6,2,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sums to 16, but the ratios aren't matching.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, none of the options directly match my calculation. Maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me reread it.\n\nWait, the question asks for the F2 generation. In the F1 cross described, the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% BB\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red\n- Cc: red\n- cc: plain\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nSo, in the F2 population, the number of each phenotype is:\n\n- Red (CC and Cc): 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 8 (assuming 16 birds)\n- Plain (cc): 25% \u2192 4\n- Brown (BB and Bb): 25% + 50% = 75% \u2192 12\n- Checkered (bb): 25% \u2192 4\n\nWait, but that leads to 8 red, 4 plain, 12 brown, 4 checkered. That totals 28, which is impossible since F2 should have 16 birds. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each gene segregates independently, leading to the following phenotypic ratios:\n\n- Red Brown: 4 parts\n- Red Checkered: 2 parts\n- Plain Brown: 2 parts\n- Plain Checkered: 2 parts\n\nWhich adds up to 10, still not 16.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, in reality, the F2 would follow the law of segregation, but since both parents are homozygous, the segregation would always result in certain gametes. But regardless, moving forward, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the genotypes. Now, looking back at the options given, the answer choices are A through H, each providing different phenotypic ratios. To determine which is correct, I'll analyze each trait separately.\n\nFirst, let's look at the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor color (gene B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor pigment (gene C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB)\n2. Checkered Brown (since B is dominant, even if b is present, it's brown)\nWait, no. The phenotype depends on both alleles. If a bird has both c and B, it will be brown. Similarly, if it has c and b, it will be plain. So the phenotypes are determined by both genes together.\n\nNow, let's list all possible combinations:\n\nEach bird is determined by its alleles for C and B.\n\nPossible combinations for C:\n\n- CC (Red)\n- Cc (Red)\n- cc (Plain)\n\nPossible combinations for B:\n\n- BB (Brown)\n- Bb (Brown)\n- bb (Checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations where the C and B alleles determine the color and pigmentation. Let's map them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, we need to count how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous for each gene, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, but considering that some phenotypes may combine due to multiple traits. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio across all traits, not per trait.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, the options seem to group phenotypes together, like \"checkered red\" meaning those with both c and B. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" would mean c and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question groups phenotypes into categories based on their combination of traits.\n\nLet me see the options again:\n\nA. 6:2 for checkered red and plain red, brown and plain brown.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because all checkered would be same trait, and all plain would be another.\n\nOption G says 12:2:2:0. That seems too extreme, probably wrong.\n\nLooking at option D: 1:3:9:3. Hmm, no, that's not matching our previous thoughts.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of each type of bird among all the possible phenotypes. Alternatively, it might be grouping phenotypes into specific classes, such as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nIn any case, let me approach it methodically. Let's calculate the number of each genotype in F2 and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nParental cross: CC BB (homozygous dominant) \u00d7 cc bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nThe F1 will be CcBb (all gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nWait, but that's under the assumption of independent assortment, which isn't exactly true because both parents are homozygous. However, in this case, since both parents are homozygous, the gametes will all be either CB or cb, leading to the above distribution.\n\nNow, mapping these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red, Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Red, Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1 = 9 cases. So the ratio would be 4:2:2:1 for Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. However, perhaps the question is grouping checkered and plain together for each trait. Let's see:\n\n- Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n\nIf we group by phenotype, then:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2 cases\n- Checkered Plain: 3 cases\n- Red Brown: 4 cases\n- Red Plain: 4 cases\n\nBut this grouping doesn't align with any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the phenotypes as separate categories without combining traits. In that case, the ratio would be 4:2:2:1 for the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, the options don't include this exact ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but our total is 9. This suggests that perhaps the question is considering the four possible phenotypes (checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown) with counts 6, 2, 2, 2 respectively, totaling 12. But according to our analysis, it's 4,2,2,1. Maybe the question is approximating or considering other factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the F2 generation's overall phenotypic ratio, ignoring individual trait separations. Let's recalculate the actual numbers.\n\nEach F2 bird will be a combination of alleles from both parents. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is generated by crossing F1 x F1.\n\nThe possible genotypes for F2 are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut the combination of these is done via the Punnett square provided earlier.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nCounting:\n\n- Red, Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Red, Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9 birds.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 for Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- E: 3:9:1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- J: 2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Total 16, but we have 9.\n- F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All same, doesn't fit.\n- A: 6:2 \u2192 Only two phenotypes, others zero, doesn't fit.\n- B: 8:4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Different ratio.\n- H: 5:3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Checkered Plain: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n- Red Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Red Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, no, case 9 is Plain, Checkered, not Red. So:\n\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Plain: 1\n- Checkered Brown: 2\n- Checkered Plain: 3\n\nTotal: 4+1+2+3=10, which still doesn't add up. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, case 9 is Plain, Checkered, so:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2\n- Checkered Plain: 3\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Plain: 1\n\nTotal: 2+3+4+1=10. Hmm, that's inconsistent with the earlier count.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted before. Let me list all nine F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Checkered Plain: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n- Red Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Red Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nSo total is 2+3+4+1=10. But the sum of squares should be 16, as each parent contributes two alleles, so 4x4=16. So why am I getting only 10?\n\nAh, because some F2 genotypes could result from different combinations. Wait, no, each F2 bird is a unique genotype, so there should be 16 possible outcomes. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird is a combination of alleles from both parents. For example, from CC BB and cc bb, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So when crossed, the F2 can be:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, but that's only four combinations, which contradicts my earlier thought. Actually, each parent can produce four types of gametes, leading to 16 possible F2 genotypes. So the correct breakdown is:\n\nEach parent produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nF1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cB \u2192 CC Bb\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n- cB + CB \u2192 CC Bb\n- cB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, this seems messy. Perhaps a better way is to recognize that the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes, considering each gene independently. But since the question groups the traits together, perhaps the answer is presented differently.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to refer to standard Punnett square results. For two loci with two alleles each, the F2 will have 16 possible genotypes. The phenotypic ratio, considering dominance, would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (cases where both alleles are B and b)\n- Checkered Plain: 2 (cases where both are b and B)\n- Red Brown: 4 (cases where C is dominant and B is recessive)\n- Red Plain: 6 (cases where C is dominant and b is recessive)\n\nWait, that adds up to 2+2+4+6=14, which doesn't account for all 16. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2\n- Checkered Plain: 2\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Plain: 6\n\nWhich totals 14, leaving two unaccounted for. This suggests that perhaps the question is expecting a simplified ratio, possibly grouping similar traits or considering approximate counts.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding these up: 1+3+9+3=16, which fits. But does that make sense?\n\nAlternatively, option G is 12:2:2:0, which also sums to 16, but the counts don't align with what I've calculated.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to use a Punnett square and count the resulting genotypes. Let me attempt that:\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nGametes: CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nCrossing F1 with F1:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB x cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB x cB \u2192 CC Bb\n- CB x cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb x CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n- cB x CB \u2192 CC Bb\n- cB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb x cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, grouping the results:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird\n- Cc BB: 2 birds (from CB x cb and cb x CB)\n- CC Bb: 2 birds (from CB x cB and cB x CB)\n- Cc Bb: 2 birds (from CB x cb and cB x cb)\n- cc bb: 1 bird\n\nBut this seems off. Alternatively, considering the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird\n- Cc BB: 2 birds\n- CC Bb: 2 birds\n- Cc Bb: 2 birds\n- cc bb: 1 bird\n\nBut now, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Red, Brown\n- Cc BB: Red, Brown\n- CC Bb: Red, Brown\n- Cc Bb: Red, Brown\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, this is inconsistent with the initial understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of both dominant alleles (for each gene) as the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the F2 will have the following phenotypic distribution based on the Punnett square:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2\n- Checkered Plain: 2\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Plain: 6\n\nAdding up to 10, which leaves six unaccounted for. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the question is oversimplified, and the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nBut according to the calculations, this doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio as a whole, including both traits, and the options reflect different ratios.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most plausible answer is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But this doesn't fit the calculations. Alternatively, option D seems to fit better, although I'm uncertain. Given the time I've spent, I'll choose option D as the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, in reality, the F2 would follow the law of segregation, but since both parents are homozygous, the segregation would always result in certain gametes. But regardless, moving forward, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the genotypes. Now, looking back at the options given, the answer choices are A through H, each providing different phenotypic ratios. To determine which is correct, I'll analyze each trait separately.\n\nFirst, let's look at the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor color (gene B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor pigment (gene C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc BB)\n2. Checkered Brown (since B is dominant, even if b is present, it's brown)\nWait, no. The phenotype depends on both alleles. If a bird has both c and B, it will be brown. Similarly, if it has c and b, it will be plain. So the phenotypes are determined by both genes together.\n\nNow, let's list all possible combinations:\n\nEach bird is determined by its alleles for C and B.\n\nPossible combinations for C:\n\n- CC (Red)\n- Cc (Red)\n- cc (Plain)\n\nPossible combinations for B:\n\n- BB (Brown)\n- Bb (Brown)\n- bb (Checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations where the C and B alleles determine the color and pigmentation. Let's map them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, we need to count how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous for each gene, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, but considering that some phenotypes may combine due to multiple traits. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio across all traits, not per trait.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, the options seem to group phenotypes together, like \"checkered red\" meaning those with both c and B. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" would mean c and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question groups phenotypes into categories based on their combination of traits.\n\nLet me see the options again:\n\nA. 6:2 for checkered red and plain red, brown and plain brown.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because all checkered would be same trait, and all plain would be another.\n\nOption G says 12:2:2:0. That seems too extreme, probably wrong.\n\nLooking at option D: 1:3:9:3. Hmm, no, that's not matching our previous thoughts.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of each type of bird among all the possible phenotypes.

Let's calculate the number of each genotype in F2 and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nParental cross: CC BB (homozygous dominant) \u00d7 cc bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nThe F1 will be CcBb (all gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nWait, but that's under the assumption of independent assortment, which isn't exactly true because both parents are homozygous. However, in this case, since both parents are homozygous, the gametes will all be either CB or cb, leading to the above distribution.\n\nNow, mapping these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red, Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Red, Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1 = 9 cases. So the ratio would be 4:2:2:1 for Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. However, perhaps the question is grouping checkered and plain together for each trait. Let's see:\n\n- Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n- Red: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n\nIf we group by phenotype, then:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2 cases\n- Checkered Plain: 3 cases\n- Red Brown: 4 cases\n- Red Plain: 4 cases\n\nBut this grouping doesn't align with any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the phenotypes as separate categories without combining traits. In that case, the ratio would be 4:2:2:1 for the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, the options don't include this exact ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums to 16, but our total is 9. This suggests that perhaps the question is considering the four possible phenotypes (checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown) with counts 6, 2, 2, 2 respectively, totaling 12. But according to our analysis, it's 4,2,2,1. Maybe the question is approximating or considering other factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the F2 generation's overall phenotypic ratio, ignoring individual trait separations. Let's recalculate the actual numbers.\n\nEach F2 bird will be a combination of alleles from both parents. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. So F1 is CcBb, and F2 is generated by crossing F1 x F1.\n\nThe possible genotypes for F2 are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut the combination of these is done via the Punnett square provided earlier.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nCounting:\n\n- Red, Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Red, Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9 birds.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1 for Red Brown : Red Checkered : Plain Brown : Plain Checkered.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- E: 3:9:1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- J: 2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Total 16, but we have 9.\n- F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All same, doesn't fit.\n- A: 6:2 \u2192 Only two phenotypes, others zero, doesn't fit.\n- B: 8:4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n- C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Different ratio.\n- H: 5:3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Checkered Plain: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n- Red Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Red Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nWait, no, case 9 is Plain, Checkered, not Red. So:\n\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Plain: 1\n- Checkered Brown: 2\n- Checkered Plain: 3\n\nTotal: 4+1+2+3=10, which still doesn't add up. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, case 9 is Plain, Checkered, so:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2\n- Checkered Plain: 3\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Plain: 1\n\nTotal: 2+3+4+1=10. Hmm, that's inconsistent with the earlier count.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted before. Let me list all nine F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Checkered Plain: Cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n- Red Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4\n- Red Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nSo total is 2+3+4+1=10. But the sum of squares should be 16, as each parent contributes two alleles, so 4x4=16. So why am I getting only 10?\n\nAh, because some F2 genotypes could result from different combinations. Wait, no, each F2 bird is a unique genotype, so there should be 16 possible outcomes. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 bird is a combination of alleles from both parents. For example, from CC BB and cc bb, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So when crossed, the F2 can be:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, but that's only four combinations, which contradicts my earlier thought. Actually, each parent can produce four types of gametes, leading to 16 possible F2 genotypes. So the correct breakdown is:\n\nEach parent produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nF1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cB \u2192 CC Bb\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n- cB + CB \u2192 CC Bb\n- cB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, this seems messy. Perhaps a better way is to recognize that the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes, considering each gene independently. But since the question groups the traits together, perhaps the answer is presented differently.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to refer to standard Punnett square results. For two loci with two alleles each, the F2 will have 16 possible genotypes. The phenotypic ratio, considering dominance, would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (cases where both alleles are B and b)\n- Checkered Plain: 2 (cases where both are b and B)\n- Red Brown: 4 (cases where C is dominant and B is recessive)\n- Red Plain: 6 (cases where C is dominant and b is recessive)\n\nWait, that adds up to 2+2+4+6=14, which doesn't account for all 16. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct counts are:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2\n- Checkered Plain: 2\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Plain: 6\n\nWhich totals 14, leaving two unaccounted for. This suggests that perhaps the question is expecting a simplified ratio, possibly grouping similar traits or considering approximate counts.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding these up: 1+3+9+3=16, which fits. But does that make sense?\n\nAlternatively, option G is 12:2:2:0, which also sums to 16, but the counts don't align with what I've calculated.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to use a Punnett square and count the resulting genotypes. Let me attempt that:\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nGametes: CB, cb, cB, cb\n\nCrossing F1 with F1:\n\n- CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB x cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB x cB \u2192 CC Bb\n- CB x cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb x CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n- cB x CB \u2192 CC Bb\n- cB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb x cB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nNow, grouping the results:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird\n- Cc BB: 2 birds (from CB x cb and cb x CB)\n- CC Bb: 2 birds (from CB x cB and cB x CB)\n- Cc Bb: 2 birds (from CB x cb and cB x cb)\n- cc bb: 1 bird\n\nBut this seems off. Alternatively, considering the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird\n- Cc BB: 2 birds\n- CC Bb: 2 birds\n- Cc Bb: 2 birds\n- cc bb: 1 bird\n\nBut now, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Red, Brown\n- Cc BB: Red, Brown\n- CC Bb: Red, Brown\n- Cc Bb: Red, Brown\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, this is inconsistent with the initial understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of both dominant alleles (for each gene) as the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the F2 will have the following phenotypic distribution based on the Punnett square:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 2\n- Checkered Plain: 2\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Plain: 6\n\nAdding up to 10, which leaves six unaccounted for. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the question is oversimplified, and the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nBut according to the calculations, this doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio as a whole, including both traits, and the options reflect different ratios.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most plausible answer is option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. But this doesn't fit the calculations. Alternatively, option D seems to fit better, although I'm uncertain. Given the time I've spent, I'll choose option D as the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed.",
    "rollout": " However, since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So the F2 genotypes are equally likely: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. But then, the phenotypes depend on the combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nWait, but the original question asks about the F2 generation after crossing a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (the F2) would involve all possible combinations. Let me make sure I get the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the initial setup was correct, but let me focus on the desired answer choices.\n\nThe options given are A through H, each presenting different phenotypic ratios. My task is to determine which option is correct. To do that, I'll analyze the possible genotypes and their phenotypes under the given dominance relationships.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible genotypes for the F2 generation:\n\nFrom the parents (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfing results in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, each of these genotypes will express certain traits based on the dominance hierarchy. Remember:\n\n- Pigmentation (B/b): \n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n- Color (C/c):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, let's map each genotype to their phenotype:\n\n1. CC (C dominant) \u2192 Red\n   - Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Brown\n   - Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n2. Cc (C dominant) \u2192 Red\n   - B (brown) \u2192 Brown\n   - b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered (checkered)\n\n3. cc (C recessive) \u2192 Plain\n   - B (brown) \u2192 Brown\n   - b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown (checkered)\n\n4. bb (C recessive) \u2192 Plain\n   - B (brown) \u2192 Brown\n   - b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered (checkered)\n\nWait, hold on. That doesn't seem right. Because each bird is made up of two alleles, so the combination of B and b affects the color, and C and c affect the pigmentation. So for each individual, their phenotype is determined by both alleles.\n\nLet me correct that mapping:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each trait. The presence of the dominant allele masks the recessive one. So, for each bird:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant B allele, it's brown.\n- Additionally, if it has at least one dominant C allele, it's red.\n- Otherwise, it's plain brown or plain checkered.\n\nBut wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the bird's phenotype depends on whether it has any dominant alleles for each trait. So:\n\nFor pigment color (B/b):\n\n- If either allele is B, the bird is brown.\n- If both are b, the bird is checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for color (C/c):\n\n- If either allele is C, the bird is red.\n- If both are c, the bird is plain.\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. Let's consider each possible genotype:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n2. CC Bb:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n3. CC bb:\n   - Pigment: b \u2192 Checkered\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered (plain)\n\n4. Cc BB:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n5. Cc Bb:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n6. Cc bb:\n   - Pigment: b \u2192 Checkered\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered (plain)\n\n7. cc BB:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: c \u2192 Plain\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Brown Plain (checkered)\n\n8. cc Bb:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: c \u2192 Plain\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Brown Plain (checkered)\n\n9. cc bb:\n   - Pigment: b \u2192 Checkered\n   - Color: c \u2192 Plain\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain (checkered)\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap. For example, a bird with genotype CC bb would have Pigment: checkered and Color: red (since C is present). Similarly, cc BB would have Pigment: brown and Color: plain.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype there are among the four possible F2 genotypes (but each F2 genotype occurs in 25% of the cases, so total 4\u00d725=100%).\n\nWait, no. Actually, the F2 population consists of four types of genotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency. Each genotype maps to a specific phenotype. Let's categorize them:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red Brown (checkered)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one B and at least one C.\n- Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\nPhenotype 2: Red Checkered (plain)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one B and does NOT have any C.\n- Genotypes: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb\n\nPhenotype 3: Brown Checkered (checkered)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one b (checkered) and at least one B (brown).\n- Wait, no. Let me clarify: Brown is due to having at least one B, regardless of color. Checkered is due to having at least one b. So, a bird is brown if B is present, and checkered if b is present. So, the combination is always brown and/or checkered. So, in terms of phenotypes, each bird is classified as either:\n   - Brown (if has at least one B)\n     - Checkered (if has at least one b)\n     - Both (so simply brown checkered)\n   - Plain (if has neither B nor c, i.e., both alleles are b)\n   \nTherefore, the four possible F2 phenotypes are:\n1. Brown Checkered (checkered)\n2. Brown Plain (plain)\n3. Checkered Brown (checkered)\n4. Checkered Plain (plain)\n\nBut looking back, the earlier analysis shows that some genotypes lead to same phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: Brown Checkered (checkered)\n- This occurs when the bird has at least one B and at least one b.\n- Genotypes: Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb\n\nPhenotype 2: Brown Plain (plain)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one B and neither C nor b.\n- Wait, that's impossible. Because if a bird has at least one B, it must have either C or c. If it also has b, it's brown checkered. If it doesn't have C, but has b, it's brown checkered. If it has neither, it's plain. So:\n\nPhenotype 2: BrownPlain (plain)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one B and neither C nor b.\n- But that's impossible because B is one allele, so if the bird has B, it could have C or not. Wait, perhaps I should use the following approach:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by two independent traits:\n- Pigment (B/b): presence of B \u2192 brown; else \u2192 checkered\n- Color (C/c): presence of C \u2192 red; else \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n1. Brown Red (both traits expressed)\n2. Brown Plain (pigment expressed, color not)\n3. Checkered Red (color expressed, pigment not)\n4. Checkered Plain (neither trait expressed)\n\nWait, but in reality, a bird cannot have both Pigment (B) and Color (C) expressed unless both are present. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Brown Red (checkered)\n- At least one B and at least one C.\n- Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\nPhenotype 2: Brown Plain (plain)\n- At least one B, but no C.\n- Wait, no. If a bird has at least one B but no C, then it's brown and plain. Similarly, if it has at least one B and no b (i.e., at least one B and at least one non-b allele, which is C), it's brown checkered. If it has at least one B and no B (which isn't possible), then it's plain.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nEach bird is characterized by two traits:\n1. Pigment (B): Present (brown) or Absent (checkered)\n2. Color (C): Present (red) or Absent (plain)\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown Red (both traits present)\n2. Brown Plain (pigenment present, color absent)\n3. Checkered Red (color present, pigment absent)\n4. Checkered Plain (neither trait present)\n\nNow, let's determine which F2 genotypes fall into which category.\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Brown Red)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2 (because has B and no C)\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (no B, has b)\n8. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (same as above)\n9. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (no B, has b)\n10. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n11. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n12. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n13. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n14. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4 (no B, no C)\n\nWait, but in our case, we have four F2 genotypes, each with 25% frequency. So, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Brown Red):\n- CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 birds\n\nPhenotype 2 (Brown Plain):\n- cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nPhenotype 3 (Checkered Red):\n- CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, CC bb has B = none, b = yes \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Checkered Red). cc BB has B = yes, C = no \u2192 Phenotype 3. cc Bb has B = yes, C = no \u2192 Phenotype 3. So Phenotype 3 occurs in three cases?\n\nWait, no. From earlier analysis, phenotypes depend on both traits. So:\n\nPhenotype 3 is when the bird has at least one b (checkered) and at least one B (brown).\n\nWhich F2 genotypes satisfy this?\n\nLooking at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Has B (brown) and b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B (brown), b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Cc BB \u2192 B (brown), b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 B (brown), b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n5. cc BB \u2192 B (yes), b (yes) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n6. cc Bb \u2192 B (yes), b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. CC bb \u2192 B (no), b (yes) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. CC bb \u2192 Same as 7 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. Cc bb \u2192 B (no), b (yes) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n10. cc BB \u2192 Same as 5 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n11. cc Bb \u2192 Same as 6 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n12. CC bb \u2192 Same as 7 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n13.

That's four birds, but in my earlier listing, Phenotype 3 has six birds. Hmm, confusion arises. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 3 occurs when:\n\n- The bird has at least one b (checkered) AND at least one B (brown).\n\nSo, any genotype where B is present and b is present.\n\nLooking at F2 genotypes:\n\n1.

Let me confirm:\n\nIn the F2 population, each of the four F2 genotypes occurs once (or twice if homozygous). So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Brown Red (phenotype 1) occurs in the first four genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 2: Brown Plain (phenotype 2) occurs in the next four genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 3: Checkered Red (phenotype 3) occurs in the remaining four genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 4: Checkered Plain (phenotype 4) occurs in the last four genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nWait, that sums up to 16 birds (four F2 generations \u00d7 four genotypes each = 16), but since each genotype occurs once, it's 4 each.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So the F2 genotypes are equally likely: 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. But then, the phenotypes depend on the combination of C/c and B/b.\n\nWait, but the original question asks about the F2 generation after crossing a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So the F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (the F2) would involve all possible combinations. Let me make sure I get the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the initial setup was correct, but let me focus on the desired answer choices.\n\nThe options given are A through H, each presenting different phenotypic ratios. My task is to determine which option is correct. To do that, I'll analyze the possible genotypes and their phenotypes under the given dominance relationships.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible genotypes for the F2 generation:\n\nFrom the parents (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfing results in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, each of these genotypes will express certain traits based on the dominance hierarchy. Remember:\n\n- Pigmentation (B/b): \n  - B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n- Color (C/c):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, let's map each genotype to their phenotype:\n\n1. CC (C dominant) \u2192 Red\n   - Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Brown\n   - Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n2. Cc (C dominant) \u2192 Red\n   - B (brown) \u2192 Brown\n   - b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered (checkered)\n\n3. cc (C recessive) \u2192 Plain\n   - B (brown) \u2192 Brown\n   - b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown (checkered)\n\n4. bb (C recessive) \u2192 Plain\n   - B (brown) \u2192 Brown\n   - b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered (checkered)\n\nWait, hold on. That doesn't seem right. Because each bird is made up of two alleles, so the combination of B and b affects the color, and C and c affect the pigmentation. So for each individual, their phenotype is determined by both alleles.\n\nLet me correct that mapping:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each trait. The presence of the dominant allele masks the recessive one. So, for each bird:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant B allele, it's brown.\n- Additionally, if it has at least one dominant C allele, it's red.\n- Otherwise, it's plain brown or plain checkered.\n\nBut wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the bird's phenotype depends on whether it has any dominant alleles for each trait. So:\n\nFor pigment color (B/b):\n\n- If either allele is B, the bird is brown.\n- If both are b, the bird is checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for color (C/c):\n\n- If either allele is C, the bird is red.\n- If both are c, the bird is plain.\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. Let's consider each possible genotype:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n2. CC Bb:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n3. CC bb:\n   - Pigment: b \u2192 Checkered\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered (plain)\n\n4. Cc BB:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n5. Cc Bb:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown (checkered)\n\n6. Cc bb:\n   - Pigment: b \u2192 Checkered\n   - Color: C \u2192 Red\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Red Checkered (plain)\n\n7. cc BB:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: c \u2192 Plain\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Brown Plain (checkered)\n\n8. cc Bb:\n   - Pigment: B \u2192 Brown\n   - Color: c \u2192 Plain\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Brown Plain (checkered)\n\n9. cc bb:\n   - Pigment: b \u2192 Checkered\n   - Color: c \u2192 Plain\n   \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Plain (checkered)\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap. For example, a bird with genotype CC bb would have Pigment: checkered and Color: red (since C is present). Similarly, cc BB would have Pigment: brown and Color: plain.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype there are among the four possible F2 genotypes (but each F2 genotype occurs in 25% of the cases, so total 4\u00d725=100%).\n\nWait, no. Actually, the F2 population consists of four types of genotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency. Each genotype maps to a specific phenotype. Let's categorize them:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red Brown (checkered)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one B and at least one C.\n- Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\nPhenotype 2: Red Checkered (plain)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one B and does NOT have any C.\n- Genotypes: CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb\n\nPhenotype 3: Brown Checkered (checkered)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one b (checkered) and at least one B (brown).\n- Wait, no. Let me clarify: Brown is due to having at least one B, regardless of color. Checkered is due to having at least one b. So, a bird is brown if B is present, and checkered if b is present. So, the combination is always brown and/or checkered. So, in terms of phenotypes, each bird is classified as either:\n   - Brown (if has at least one B)\n     - Checkered (if has at least one b)\n     - Both (so simply brown checkered)\n   - Plain (if has neither B nor c, i.e., both alleles are b)\n   \nTherefore, the four possible F2 phenotypes are:\n1. Brown Checkered (checkered)\n2. Brown Plain (plain)\n3. Checkered Brown (checkered)\n4. Checkered Plain (plain)\n\nBut looking back, the earlier analysis shows that some genotypes lead to same phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: Brown Checkered (checkered)\n- This occurs when the bird has at least one B and at least one b.\n- Genotypes: Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb\n\nPhenotype 2: Brown Plain (plain)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one B and neither C nor b.\n- Wait, that's impossible. Because if a bird has at least one B, it must have either C or c. If it also has b, it's brown checkered. If it doesn't have C, but has b, it's brown checkered. If it has neither, it's plain. So:\n\nPhenotype 2: BrownPlain (plain)\n- Occurs when the bird has at least one B and neither C nor b.\n- But that's impossible because B is one allele, so if the bird has B, it could have C or not. Wait, perhaps I should use the following approach:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by two independent traits:\n- Pigment (B/b): presence of B \u2192 brown; else \u2192 checkered\n- Color (C/c): presence of C \u2192 red; else \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n1. Brown Red (both traits expressed)\n2. Brown Plain (pigment expressed, color not)\n3. Checkered Red (color expressed, pigment not)\n4. Checkered Plain (neither trait expressed)\n\nWait, but in reality, a bird cannot have both Pigment (B) and Color (C) expressed unless both are present. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Brown Red (checkered)\n- At least one B and at least one C.\n- Genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\nPhenotype 2: Brown Plain (plain)\n- At least one B, but no C.\n- Wait, no. If a bird has at least one B but no C, then it's brown and plain. Similarly, if it has at least one B and no b (i.e., at least one B and at least one non-b allele, which is C), it's brown checkered. If it has at least one B and no B (which isn't possible), then it's plain.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nEach bird is characterized by two traits:\n1. Pigment (B): Present (brown) or Absent (checkered)\n2. Color (C): Present (red) or Absent (plain)\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown Red (both traits present)\n2. Brown Plain (pigenment present, color absent)\n3. Checkered Red (color present, pigment absent)\n4. Checkered Plain (neither trait present)\n\nNow, let's determine which F2 genotypes fall into which category.\n\nLooking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1 (Brown Red)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2 (because has B and no C)\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (no B, has b)\n8. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (same as above)\n9. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3 (no B, has b)\n10. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 2\n11. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n12. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n13. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n14. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4 (no B, no C)\n\nWait, but in our case, we have four F2 genotypes, each with 25% frequency. So, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Brown Red):\n- CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 birds\n\nPhenotype 2 (Brown Plain):\n- cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nPhenotype 3 (Checkered Red):\n- CC bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, CC bb has B = none, b = yes \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Checkered Red). cc BB has B = yes, C = no \u2192 Phenotype 3. cc Bb has B = yes, C = no \u2192 Phenotype 3. So Phenotype 3 occurs in three cases?\n\nWait, no. From earlier analysis, phenotypes depend on both traits. So:\n\nPhenotype 3 is when the bird has at least one b (checkered) and at least one B (brown).\n\nWhich F2 genotypes satisfy this?\n\nLooking at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Has B (brown) and b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B (brown), b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Cc BB \u2192 B (brown), b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 B (brown), b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n5. cc BB \u2192 B (yes), b (yes) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n6. cc Bb \u2192 B (yes), b (no) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. CC bb \u2192 B (no), b (yes) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. CC bb \u2192 Same as 7 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. Cc bb \u2192 B (no), b (yes) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n10. cc BB \u2192 Same as 5 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n11. cc Bb \u2192 Same as 6 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n12. CC bb \u2192 Same as 7 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n13. Cc bb \u2192 Same as 9 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n14. cc bb \u2192 B (no), C (no) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo, counting Phenotype 1 (Brown Red):\nOnly the first four F2 genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 2 (Brown Plain):\nOnly the last four F2 genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 3 (Checkered Red):\nBirds with at least one b and at least one B. These are:\n\n- cc BB: Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 3\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 3\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 3\nWait, no. Wait, from above, Phenotype 3 occurs in the following F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3\n- cc BB: Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: Phenotype 3\n- CC bb: Phenotype 3 (duplicate)\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 3\n- Cc bb: Phenotype 3 (duplicate)\nSo unique instances: 3 (from cc BB, cc Bb, CC bb) plus 3 (from Cc bb) \u2192 Total 6 birds.\n\nPhenotype 4 (Checkered Plain):\nOnly the last F2 genotype: cc bb \u2192 1 bird.\n\nWait, but wait: according to the previous breakdown, Phenotype 3 includes cc BB, cc Bb, CC bb, and Cc bb. That's four birds, but in my earlier listing, Phenotype 3 has six birds. Hmm, confusion arises. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 3 occurs when:\n\n- The bird has at least one b (checkered) AND at least one B (brown).\n\nSo, any genotype where B is present and b is present.\n\nLooking at F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 B present, b not \u2192 Phenotype 2\n2. CC Bb \u2192 B present, b not \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Cc BB \u2192 B present, b not \u2192 Phenotype 2\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 B present, b not \u2192 Phenotype 2\n5. cc BB \u2192 B not, b present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n6. cc Bb \u2192 B present, b not \u2192 Phenotype 3\n7. CC bb \u2192 B not, b present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. CC bb \u2192 Same as 7 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. Cc bb \u2192 B not, b present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n10. cc BB \u2192 Same as 5 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n11. cc Bb \u2192 Same as 6 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n12. CC bb \u2192 Same as 7 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n13. Cc bb \u2192 Same as 9 \u2192 Phenotype 3\n14. cc bb \u2192 B not, C not \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo, Phenotype 3 occurs in F2 genotypes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 \u2192 8 birds.\n\nWait, that makes sense because each F2 genotype has a 25% chance, but Phenotype 3 is when B is present and b is present, which happens in half of the F2 individuals. Let me confirm:\n\nIn the F2 population, each of the four F2 genotypes occurs once (or twice if homozygous). So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Brown Red (phenotype 1) occurs in the first four genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 2: Brown Plain (phenotype 2) occurs in the next four genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 3: Checkered Red (phenotype 3) occurs in the remaining four genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype 4: Checkered Plain (phenotype 4) occurs in the last four genotypes: 4 birds.\n\nWait, that sums up to 16 birds (four F2 generations \u00d7 four genotypes each = 16), but since each genotype occurs once, it's 4 each.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfs to get F2. But the user's question seems to have already calculated the F2 phenotypes, so maybe I don't need to go through the entire process. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants us to calculate the expected phenotypes based on the given options.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nThe options are A to H, each giving different phenotypic ratios. So, perhaps I should focus on calculating the expected phenotypes without going into the full Punnett square.\n\nLet me outline the possible genotypes for each gene and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSince the traits are independent, the combination of these genes will determine the phenotype.\n\nNow, let's consider the F2 generation.

Because if it were a homedybrid cross (like (C_B_) crossed with (c_b_)), the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow Mendelian ratios. But in this case, the user wrote it as CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, which suggests a dihybrid cross (both parents heterozygous for both genes).\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: In dihybrid crosses, the parents are usually heterozygous for both genes, like (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb). But here, the parents are homozygous for each gene: (CC BB) and (cc bb). That's a different scenario called a \"complementary\" cross or a \"parental\" cross. In such cases, the F1 will all be CcBb, and the F2 will have four possible genotypes with specific probabilities.\n\nSo, for F2, the possible genotypes would be:\n\n1. CC BB (Red, Brown)\n2. CC bb (Plain, Brown)\n3. cc BB (Checkered, Brown)\n4. cc bb (Checkered, Checkered)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it depends on the parent's genotypes. Since both parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 would have all four possible combinations, each with certain probabilities. Let's calculate the probabilities for each genotype.\n\nEach parent contributes either C or c for gene C, and B or b for gene B. Since the parents are homozygous, each gamete carries exactly one allele for each gene. So, the possible gametes from each parent are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 will have a 25% chance for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB (from CB + CB): probability = (1/2)^2 = 25%\n- CC bb (from CB + cb): probability = (1/2)*(1/2) * 2 = 25%\n- cc BB (from cb + cb): probability = (1/2)^2 = 25%\n- cc bb (from cb + cb): probability = (1/2)^2 = 25%\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. So when F1 selfs, the F2 would indeed have a 25% chance for each of the four genotypes.\n\nNow, translating these genotypes into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Red, Brown\n- CC bb: C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc BB: c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 Checkered, Brown\n- cc bb: c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered, Checkered\n\nNext, we count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Assuming a large number of offspring, the ratio would be:\n\n- Red, Brown: 25%\n- Plain, Brown: 25%\n- Checkered, Brown: 25%\n- Checkered, Checkered: 25%\n\nBut looking at the options provided, none directly reflect this. Instead, the options provide various ratios. Perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question isn't about a dihybrid cross but a separate cross, as the user initially indicated. Wait, the user's initial prompt says: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Hmm, \"adihybridcross\"\u2014that usually refers to a cross involving multiple loci, often leading to incomplete dominance. But here, the parents are homozygous for each gene, so perhaps it's a complementary cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant a dihybrid cross, but phrased it incorrectly. Given that the options provided do not match the simple 25% ratio for each phenotype, I must reevaluate.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the phenotypic ratios in the options suggest that the parents are not both homozygous. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would have the following genotypes and phenotypes based on independent assortment:\n\n- CC BB: All red and brown (since B is dominant and B is expressed over bb)\n- CC bb: Plain and brown\n- cc BB: Checkered and brown\n- cc bb: Checkered and checkered\n\nAssuming Mendelian inheritance, each of the four genotypes would occur equally likely, resulting in a 25% ratio for each phenotype.

Perhaps the question involves a different approach, such as considering dominance hierarchies beyond the standard ones.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the phenotypic ratios are being considered based on the expression of multiple traits. For example, if the presence of at least one dominant allele for one trait leads to a particular phenotype. But in this case, since both traits are expressed regardless of the alleles, the phenotypes remain as described earlier.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option E states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That suggests a higher proportion of plain red and plain brown. This could happen if the parents are not both homozygous but rather one is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio in F2, but scaled differently based on dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would have four possible genotypes with equal likelihood, leading to four phenotypes each occurring 25% of the time. But the options provided don't include 25% ratios. \n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to refer to a dihybrid cross between a heterozygous bird (e.g., CcBB) and a recessive bird (ccbb), but mistakenly labeled it as a homedybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a cross where the parents are not both homozygous, leading to a different F2 ratio.\n\nIf the parents were CcBB and ccbb, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have a different distribution due to partial dominance or other factors. However, given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This suggests a 1:3:9:9 ratio, which resembles a dihybrid cross without partial dominance but with independent assortment.\n\nWait, no\u2014that would typically come from a dihybrid cross where each gene is independently assorting, leading to 9 possible phenotypes, but in this case, there are only four phenotypes because some combinations may lead to the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to different phenotypes. For example:\n\n- If both genes are present (at least one dominant allele), the bird is red and brown.\n- If only gene C is present, it's plain red or plain brown.\n- Similarly for gene B.\n\nBut this complicates things further. However, given the options, option D seems plausible as it reflects a 1:3:9:9 ratio, which could correspond to a dihybrid cross without considering dominance fully.\n\nIn summary, given the ambiguity and the fact that none of the options perfectly match my initial analysis, I'll go with option D, as it represents a common Mendelian F2 ratio, possibly adjusted for dominance hierarchies or incomplete dominance, leading to a 1:3:9:9 split among the four phenotypes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the actual genotypes depend on how the alleles assort.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the actual genotypes depend on how the alleles assort. However, without knowing the exact mode of segregation, perhaps we proceed under Mendelian assumptions. So the F2 would be: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B and b.\n\nNow, moving on to phenotypes. The phenotype depends on both genes. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\nFor the pigment color (gene C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the color (gene B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n- CC (for C): Checkered\n   - Since B is unknown yet, wait no\u2014it's for B as well. Wait, no. Wait, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. Let's see:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct a table mapping each genotype to the resulting phenotype.\n\nBut alternatively, perhaps it's easier to determine the phenotypic ratios directly by analyzing the possible combinations.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and then determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - CC (red pigment)\n  - cc (plain pigment)\n\n- For gene B:\n  - BB (brown color)\n  - bb (checkered color)\n\nBut since each bird has two alleles for each gene, the combination of C and B will determine the phenotype.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (only cc genotype for C and BB genotype for B)\n2. Checkered brown (only cc for C and bb for B)\n3. Plain red (only CC for C and BB for B)\n4. Plain brown (only CC for C and bb for B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because each bird's genotype for each gene is independent, except for the fact that the same bird has both alleles for each gene.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Cc (from C and c)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for example, if a bird is CC, it has two C alleles. If it's Cc, it has one C and one c. Similarly for B.\n\nSo, the phenotype for each gene is determined independently. Wait, no. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele affects the phenotype for each gene, but the combination of dominant alleles for each gene may influence the overall color.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that the phenotype is determined by both genes. Let me try to outline all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nSince there are two genes, each with two possible alleles, the total number of possible genotypes is 3 x 3 = 9. Each bird's genotype is a combination of two alleles for gene C and two for gene B.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n4. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain?\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation after crossing F1 with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the probabilities of each phenotype based on the genetic ratios.\n\nGiven that F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the expected F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut since both genes are acting independently, the combined genotypes will be the product of these probabilities. However, phenotypically, some genotypes will combine to produce the same phenotype.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, let's consider all possible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. CC (for C) and BB (for B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC (for C) and Bb (for B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC (for C) and bb (for B) \u2192 Checkered plain\n4. Cc (for C) and BB (for B) \u2192 Checkered red (since C is dominant)\n5. Cc (for C) and Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc (for C) and bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n7. cc (for C) and BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc (for C) and Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc (for C) and bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, now I realize that some of these combinations lead to the same phenotype. For example, Cc and BB would still be Checkered red, regardless of whether B is dominant or recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered red\n2. Checkered brown\n3. Checkered plain\n4. Plain red\n5. Plain brown\n\nNow, let's count how many combinations fall into each category.\n\n- **Checkered red**: Occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (BB or Bb or bb? Wait, no. Wait, in terms of phenotype, if C is recessive (so cc) and B is dominant (any B or b?), wait no, the phenotype depends on both genes. Wait, perhaps it's better to structure this differently.\n\nActually, the correct way is to look at the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered red occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb).\n- Checkered brown occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB).\n- Checkered plain occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB).\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nPhenotype is determined by both genes. So:\n\n- If an individual has at least one dominant allele for each gene, their phenotype is brown or red depending on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible phenotypes and their counts based on the possible genotypes.\n\nFrom the earlier breakdown:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap in phenotype. For instance, Cc and BB would still be Checkered red, while CC and BB would also be Checkered red. So the key is to group together genotypes that result in the same phenotype.\n\nLet me restructure the genotypes into their phenotypic categories:\n\n- **Checkered red (cr)**: Genotypes where C is recessive (cc) AND B is recessive (bb). Only 1 combination: cc bb.\n- **Checkered brown (cb)**: Genotypes where C is recessive (cc) AND B is dominant (Bb or BB). These are:\n  - cc Bb\n  - cc BB\n  Total of 2 combinations.\n- **Checkered plain (cp)**: Genotypes where C is recessive (cc) AND B is dominant (Bb or BB)? Wait, no, because if C is recessive (cc), and B is dominant (Bb or BB), then the phenotype is Checkered brown. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Wait, no\u2014if C is recessive (cc), then regardless of B, the phenotype will be Checkered. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. If C is recessive (cc), then the phenotype will be Checkered for the pigment color, regardless of B. So Checkered red is when C is recessive and B is recessive.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- Color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. A bird's phenotype is:\n\n- **Red** if pigment is present (C is dominant) and color is present (B is dominant or recessive? Wait, no\u2014the color is determined separately. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, if a bird has C (pigment dominant) and B (color dominant), it's brown-red, but if it has c (pigment recessive) and b (color recessive), it's plain-checkered. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the color is determined by B alone. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me go back. The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), then it's red or plain depending on the color trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, the phenotype for pigment color is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for C. If yes, then pigment is red; else, plain. Similarly, the color trait is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for B. If yes, brown; else, checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because if a bird has C dominant, then pigment is red, regardless of color. Similarly, if B is dominant, color is brown, regardless of pigment. But in reality, a bird could have both traits expressed. Wait, perhaps the presence of any dominant allele for each gene results in the respective phenotype. So, a bird with C and B will be brown-red, a bird with C and b will be red-checkered, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a grid of C and B alleles:\n\n- Rows: C and c\n- Columns: B and b\n- Cells: Possible combinations and phenotypes.\n\nSo:\n\n1. C/C (C for pigment, C for color) \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Brown-red (if both dominant)\nWait, but no\u2014the presence of any dominant allele in either gene leads to that phenotype. So:\n\n- C/C \u2192 Pigment red, color brown \u2192 Brown-red\n- C/c \u2192 Pigment red, color brown \u2192 Brown-red\n- c/C \u2192 Pigment plain, color brown \u2192 Checkered-brown\n- c/c \u2192 Pigment plain, color plain \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, red is dominant for pigment, and brown is dominant for color. So, if a bird has even one dominant allele for pigment, it's red; if it has even one dominant allele for color, it's brown.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the phenotype is determined by whichever gene has the dominant allele. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one dominant C allele, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. For color, if the bird has at least one dominant B allele, it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown (both dominant)\n2. Red-checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain-brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain-checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, let's find how many birds fall into each category based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - CC (25%)\n  - Cc (50%)\n  - cc (25%)\n\n- For color (B):\n  - BB (25%)\n  - Bb (50%)\n  - bb (25%)\n\nHowever, since the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the actual distribution of phenotypes can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of C and B alleles.\n\nLet's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red-brown (CC/BB)**: Both C and B are dominant. This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B. How often does this occur?\n\n   To calculate this, we can subtract the cases where C is recessive or B is recessive.\n\n   - Probability of CC: 25%\n   - Probability of Bb: 50%\n   - Probability of bb: 25%\n\n   Wait, no. Let's think differently. The probability of having at least one C is 75% (since cc is 25%). The probability of having at least one B is 75%. Since the two events are independent, the probability of having both at least one C and at least one B is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.\n\n   But wait, that's the probability of having at least one C and at least one B. But in our case, the phenotype is red-brown if C and/or B are present. Wait, no\u2014in reality, if C is present (regardless of B), then it's red, and if B is present (regardless of C), then it's brown. So, the phenotype is red-brown if either C is present OR B is present.\n\n   Alternatively, the phenotype is red-brown if (C is present AND B is present). Wait, no\u2014no. Wait, if either C or B is present, the phenotype is brown-red. If neither is present, it's plain-checkered.\n\n   So, the probability of being red-brown is the probability of having at least one C plus the probability of having at least one B minus the probability of having both. Wait, that's inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n   Let me compute it properly:\n\n   P(red-brown) = P(C present) + P(B present) - P(C present AND B present)\n\n   P(C present) = 75%, P(B present) = 75%, P(C present AND B present) = ?\n\n   P(C present AND B present) is the probability of having at least one C and at least one B. That's equivalent to 1 - P(not C OR not B).\n\n   Not C is cc (25%), not B is bb (25%).\n\n   So P(not C OR not B) = P(cc) + P(bb) - P(cc AND bb) = 25% + 25% - 25%*25% = 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%.\n\n   Wait, that's incorrect. The formula for union is P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Here, A is not C (cc), B is not B (bb). So P(not C OR not B) = P(cc) + P(bb) - P(cc AND bb) = 25% + 25% - 6.25% = 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%. Therefore, P(C present AND B present) = 1 - 43.75% = 56.25%.\n\n   So, P(red-brown) = 75% + 75% - 56.25% = 93.75%? That can't be right because the maximum possible is 100%. Wait, something's wrong here.\n\n   Let me try another approach. Instead of calculating it via probabilities, perhaps I should count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\n   In the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Checkered red (CR)\n   2. Checkered brown (CB)\n   3. Checkered plain (CP)\n   4. Plain red (PR)\n   5. Plain brown (PB)\n\n   Wait, no, according to earlier analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Checkered red (cr)\n   2. Checkered brown (cb)\n   3. Checkered plain (cp)\n   4. Plain red (pr)\n   5. Plain brown (pb)\n\n   Now, let's calculate how many of each.\n\n   From the Punnett square of F1 \u00d7 F1 (which is 9 possible genotypes), but since F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1, each F2 individual is produced by F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\n   Wait, but the initial question mentions a dihybrid cross, so perhaps we're looking at F1 \u00d7 F1. But in the user's question, it's written as \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" followed by a gametes list. Then, the F1 \u00d7 F1 gametes are given, leading to an F1 \u00d7 F1 cross, producing a dihybrid cross for the F2 generation.\n\n   So, perhaps the user made a mistake in the description, conflating the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross with an adihybrid cross, but in any case, the F2 generation is what's needed.\n\n   Given that, let's model the F2 as the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, but considering the dihybrid cross.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the user intended to describe the F2 generation as arising from F1 \u00d7 F1, but the way they presented the gametes might have confused it with an adihybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to write the F2 as the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, but perhaps the gametes were described incorrectly.\n\n   Anyway, proceeding with the assumption that the F2 is derived from F1 \u00d7 F1, but that might not align with the user's presentation. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 is the result of a dihybrid cross between F1 and F1, but given that F1 is CcBb, the F2 would be the same as F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to the same phenotypic ratios as before.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the user mistakenly wrote the F1 as a dihybrid cross, but in reality, the F1 is a monohybrid cross (but that wouldn't make much sense for two genes). Wait, perhaps I should focus on the F2 generation as derived from F1 \u00d7 F1, but given that F1 is a dihybrid, F2 would be the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant to say F1 \u00d7 F1, but listed the gametes as if from a dihybrid cross, which complicates things.\n\n   Regardless, perhaps I should proceed with the standard dihybrid cross (F1 \u00d7 F1) and calculate the phenotypic ratios accordingly.\n\n   So, the F1",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the actual genotypes depend on how the alleles assort. However, without knowing the exact mode of segregation, perhaps we proceed under Mendelian assumptions. So the F2 would be: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B and b.\n\nNow, moving on to phenotypes. The phenotype depends on both genes. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\nFor the pigment color (gene C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the color (gene B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n\n- CC (for C): Checkered\n   - Since B is unknown yet, wait no\u2014it's for B as well. Wait, no. Wait, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. Let's see:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct a table mapping each genotype to the resulting phenotype.\n\nBut alternatively, perhaps it's easier to determine the phenotypic ratios directly by analyzing the possible combinations.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and then determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - CC (red pigment)\n  - cc (plain pigment)\n\n- For gene B:\n  - BB (brown color)\n  - bb (checkered color)\n\nBut since each bird has two alleles for each gene, the combination of C and B will determine the phenotype.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (only cc genotype for C and BB genotype for B)\n2. Checkered brown (only cc for C and bb for B)\n3. Plain red (only CC for C and BB for B)\n4. Plain brown (only CC for C and bb for B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Because each bird's genotype for each gene is independent, except for the fact that the same bird has both alleles for each gene.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n- Cc (from C and c)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, for example, if a bird is CC, it has two C alleles. If it's Cc, it has one C and one c. Similarly for B.\n\nSo, the phenotype for each gene is determined independently. Wait, no. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele affects the phenotype for each gene, but the combination of dominant alleles for each gene may influence the overall color.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that the phenotype is determined by both genes. Let me try to outline all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nSince there are two genes, each with two possible alleles, the total number of possible genotypes is 3 x 3 = 9. Each bird's genotype is a combination of two alleles for gene C and two for gene B.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n4. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain?\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation after crossing F1 with itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the probabilities of each phenotype based on the genetic ratios.\n\nGiven that F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the expected F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut since both genes are acting independently, the combined genotypes will be the product of these probabilities. However, phenotypically, some genotypes will combine to produce the same phenotype.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, let's consider all possible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. CC (for C) and BB (for B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC (for C) and Bb (for B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC (for C) and bb (for B) \u2192 Checkered plain\n4. Cc (for C) and BB (for B) \u2192 Checkered red (since C is dominant)\n5. Cc (for C) and Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc (for C) and bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n7. cc (for C) and BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc (for C) and Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc (for C) and bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, now I realize that some of these combinations lead to the same phenotype. For example, Cc and BB would still be Checkered red, regardless of whether B is dominant or recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered red\n2. Checkered brown\n3. Checkered plain\n4. Plain red\n5. Plain brown\n\nNow, let's count how many combinations fall into each category.\n\n- **Checkered red**: Occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (BB or Bb or bb? Wait, no. Wait, in terms of phenotype, if C is recessive (so cc) and B is dominant (any B or b?), wait no, the phenotype depends on both genes. Wait, perhaps it's better to structure this differently.\n\nActually, the correct way is to look at the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Checkered red occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is recessive (bb).\n- Checkered brown occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB).\n- Checkered plain occurs when C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB).\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nPhenotype is determined by both genes. So:\n\n- If an individual has at least one dominant allele for each gene, their phenotype is brown or red depending on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all possible phenotypes and their counts based on the possible genotypes.\n\nFrom the earlier breakdown:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap in phenotype. For instance, Cc and BB would still be Checkered red, while CC and BB would also be Checkered red. So the key is to group together genotypes that result in the same phenotype.\n\nLet me restructure the genotypes into their phenotypic categories:\n\n- **Checkered red (cr)**: Genotypes where C is recessive (cc) AND B is recessive (bb). Only 1 combination: cc bb.\n- **Checkered brown (cb)**: Genotypes where C is recessive (cc) AND B is dominant (Bb or BB). These are:\n  - cc Bb\n  - cc BB\n  Total of 2 combinations.\n- **Checkered plain (cp)**: Genotypes where C is recessive (cc) AND B is dominant (Bb or BB)? Wait, no, because if C is recessive (cc), and B is dominant (Bb or BB), then the phenotype is Checkered brown. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Wait, no\u2014if C is recessive (cc), then regardless of B, the phenotype will be Checkered. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. If C is recessive (cc), then the phenotype will be Checkered for the pigment color, regardless of B. So Checkered red is when C is recessive and B is recessive.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- Color (B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. A bird's phenotype is:\n\n- **Red** if pigment is present (C is dominant) and color is present (B is dominant or recessive? Wait, no\u2014the color is determined separately. So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the phenotype is determined by both traits. So, if a bird has C (pigment dominant) and B (color dominant), it's brown-red, but if it has c (pigment recessive) and b (color recessive), it's plain-checkered. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the color is determined by B alone. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me go back. The phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), then it's red or plain depending on the color trait.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two alleles for each gene. So, the phenotype for pigment color is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for C. If yes, then pigment is red; else, plain. Similarly, the color trait is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for B. If yes, brown; else, checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because if a bird has C dominant, then pigment is red, regardless of color. Similarly, if B is dominant, color is brown, regardless of pigment. But in reality, a bird could have both traits expressed. Wait, perhaps the presence of any dominant allele for each gene results in the respective phenotype. So, a bird with C and B will be brown-red, a bird with C and b will be red-checkered, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a grid of C and B alleles:\n\n- Rows: C and c\n- Columns: B and b\n- Cells: Possible combinations and phenotypes.\n\nSo:\n\n1. C/C (C for pigment, C for color) \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Brown-red (if both dominant)\nWait, but no\u2014the presence of any dominant allele in either gene leads to that phenotype. So:\n\n- C/C \u2192 Pigment red, color brown \u2192 Brown-red\n- C/c \u2192 Pigment red, color brown \u2192 Brown-red\n- c/C \u2192 Pigment plain, color brown \u2192 Checkered-brown\n- c/c \u2192 Pigment plain, color plain \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, red is dominant for pigment, and brown is dominant for color. So, if a bird has even one dominant allele for pigment, it's red; if it has even one dominant allele for color, it's brown.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the phenotype is determined by whichever gene has the dominant allele. So, for pigment color, if the bird has at least one dominant C allele, it's red; otherwise, it's plain. For color, if the bird has at least one dominant B allele, it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-brown (both dominant)\n2. Red-checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain-brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain-checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, let's find how many birds fall into each category based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - CC (25%)\n  - Cc (50%)\n  - cc (25%)\n\n- For color (B):\n  - BB (25%)\n  - Bb (50%)\n  - bb (25%)\n\nHowever, since the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the actual distribution of phenotypes can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of C and B alleles.\n\nLet's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red-brown (CC/BB)**: Both C and B are dominant. This happens when the bird has at least one C and at least one B. How often does this occur?\n\n   To calculate this, we can subtract the cases where C is recessive or B is recessive.\n\n   - Probability of CC: 25%\n   - Probability of Bb: 50%\n   - Probability of bb: 25%\n\n   Wait, no. Let's think differently. The probability of having at least one C is 75% (since cc is 25%). The probability of having at least one B is 75%. Since the two events are independent, the probability of having both at least one C and at least one B is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%.\n\n   But wait, that's the probability of having at least one C and at least one B. But in our case, the phenotype is red-brown if C and/or B are present. Wait, no\u2014in reality, if C is present (regardless of B), then it's red, and if B is present (regardless of C), then it's brown. So, the phenotype is red-brown if either C is present OR B is present.\n\n   Alternatively, the phenotype is red-brown if (C is present AND B is present). Wait, no\u2014no. Wait, if either C or B is present, the phenotype is brown-red. If neither is present, it's plain-checkered.\n\n   So, the probability of being red-brown is the probability of having at least one C plus the probability of having at least one B minus the probability of having both. Wait, that's inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n   Let me compute it properly:\n\n   P(red-brown) = P(C present) + P(B present) - P(C present AND B present)\n\n   P(C present) = 75%, P(B present) = 75%, P(C present AND B present) = ?\n\n   P(C present AND B present) is the probability of having at least one C and at least one B. That's equivalent to 1 - P(not C OR not B).\n\n   Not C is cc (25%), not B is bb (25%).\n\n   So P(not C OR not B) = P(cc) + P(bb) - P(cc AND bb) = 25% + 25% - 25%*25% = 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%.\n\n   Wait, that's incorrect. The formula for union is P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Here, A is not C (cc), B is not B (bb). So P(not C OR not B) = P(cc) + P(bb) - P(cc AND bb) = 25% + 25% - 6.25% = 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%. Therefore, P(C present AND B present) = 1 - 43.75% = 56.25%.\n\n   So, P(red-brown) = 75% + 75% - 56.25% = 93.75%? That can't be right because the maximum possible is 100%. Wait, something's wrong here.\n\n   Let me try another approach. Instead of calculating it via probabilities, perhaps I should count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\n   In the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Checkered red (CR)\n   2. Checkered brown (CB)\n   3. Checkered plain (CP)\n   4. Plain red (PR)\n   5. Plain brown (PB)\n\n   Wait, no, according to earlier analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n   1. Checkered red (cr)\n   2. Checkered brown (cb)\n   3. Checkered plain (cp)\n   4. Plain red (pr)\n   5. Plain brown (pb)\n\n   Now, let's calculate how many of each.\n\n   From the Punnett square of F1 \u00d7 F1 (which is 9 possible genotypes), but since F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1, each F2 individual is produced by F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\n   Wait, but the initial question mentions a dihybrid cross, so perhaps we're looking at F1 \u00d7 F1. But in the user's question, it's written as \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird,\" followed by a gametes list. Then, the F1 \u00d7 F1 gametes are given, leading to an F1 \u00d7 F1 cross, producing a dihybrid cross for the F2 generation.\n\n   So, perhaps the user made a mistake in the description, conflating the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross with an adihybrid cross, but in any case, the F2 generation is what's needed.\n\n   Given that, let's model the F2 as the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, but considering the dihybrid cross.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the user intended to describe the F2 generation as arising from F1 \u00d7 F1, but the way they presented the gametes might have confused it with an adihybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to write the F2 as the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, but perhaps the gametes were described incorrectly.\n\n   Anyway, proceeding with the assumption that the F2 is derived from F1 \u00d7 F1, but that might not align with the user's presentation. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 is the result of a dihybrid cross between F1 and F1, but given that F1 is CcBb, the F2 would be the same as F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to the same phenotypic ratios as before.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the user mistakenly wrote the F1 as a dihybrid cross, but in reality, the F1 is a monohybrid cross (but that wouldn't make much sense for two genes). Wait, perhaps I should focus on the F2 generation as derived from F1 \u00d7 F1, but given that F1 is a dihybrid, F2 would be the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant to say F1 \u00d7 F1, but listed the gametes as if from a dihybrid cross, which complicates things.\n\n   Regardless, perhaps I should proceed with the standard dihybrid cross (F1 \u00d7 F1) and calculate the phenotypic ratios accordingly.\n\n   So, the F1",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, the problem states that the parents are homozygous, so the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene independently.",
    "rollout": " However, the problem states that the parents are homozygous, so the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene independently. But since there are two genes, the total phenotypic ratio could be different.\n\nWait, but the user already provided a detailed set of gametes for F1, so perhaps they're considering all possible gamete combinations beyond F1. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the F2 phenotype ratio after considering the possible F2 genotypes. Let me try to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, determine the genotypes of the parents:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Homozygous dominant for both genes.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nThe F1 results from crossing these two parents: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Since both parents are homozygous, the F1 will be CcBb, as each allele is passed on equally. The F1 will produce four types of gametes: CB and cb, each occurring at 50% probability.\n\nNow, F1 (CcBb) will self-fertilize to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC\n- From CB + cb = Cc\n- From cb + CB = Cc\n- From cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and cc. Now, considering dominance and recessiveness:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC and Cc \u2192 dominant (red)\n- cc \u2192 recessive (plain)\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB and Bb \u2192 dominant (brown)\n- bb \u2192 recessive (checkered)\n\nSo each bird has two genes. The phenotype is determined by both genes. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red) \u2192 Checkered if B is present?\nWait, no. Wait, the checkered refers to the recessive allele, which is c. So, the presence of c (recessive allele) makes the bird checkered. The color depends on B and b. So, for the phenotype, it's a combination of both genes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on both gene interactions. For each gene:\n\nGene C: \n- C \u2192 red (dominant)\n- c \u2192 plain (recessive)\n\nGene B:\n- B \u2192 brown (dominant)\n- b \u2192 checkered (recessive)\n\nEach gene interaction follows the rules where the dominant allele masks the recessive one. So, for example, if a bird has both B and c alleles, it'll be brown. If it has both c and c, it'll be plain. Similarly for gene C.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: C_B_ \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. Gene C dominant, gene B recessive: C_bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. Gene C recessive, gene B dominant: ccBB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both genes recessive: ccbb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no. Actually, the recessive phenotype overrides the dominant one. So, for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will display the corresponding phenotype. Let me re-express this properly:\n\nFor each gene:\n- C (C or C_) \u2192 red\n- c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\n- B (B or B_) \u2192 brown\n- b (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C_B_: Both genes have dominant alleles \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C_bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. ccBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. ccbb: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nBut wait, in reality, a bird cannot have both recessive alleles for both genes because the recessive allele is dominant over the dominant one. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene will express the phenotype associated with those alleles.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\na. Checkered red (C c and b b)\nb. Plain red (C c and B b)\nc. Plain brown (c c and B b)\nd. Plain brown (c c and b b) \u2014 same as c?\n\nWait, no. Let me make a table:\n\nEach bird will have two genes. The phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes have dominant alleles (C and B): Checkered red (because c is present, making the bird checkered)\n2. Only gene C has dominant (C_ and B_): Red\n3. Only gene B has dominant (C_ and B_): Brown\n4. Neither gene has dominant (c c and b b): Checkered brown\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to the corresponding phenotype. So, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for gene C, it's red. If it also has at least one dominant allele for gene B, it's brown. If neither has dominant alleles, it's checkered brown.\n\nWait, but if a bird has dominant allele for gene C but not for gene B, it's red. If it has dominant for gene B but not C, it's brown. If it has neither, it's checkered brown.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: Checkered red (c present, making it checkered, and both brown)\n2. Only gene C dominant: Red (no B dominant, so checkered brown becomes plain red)\n3. Only gene B dominant: Brown (no C dominant, so red becomes plain brown)\n4. Neither gene dominant: Checkered brown (both c and b present)\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting. Let me take an example bird. Suppose a bird has allele C and c, and B and b. It would have both dominant alleles, so it's red and brown, making it checkered red. Another bird has C and c, and b and b: It's red and checkered, making it plain red. A bird with c and c, and B and b: It's plain brown. And a bird with c and c, and b and b: It's checkered brown.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_)\n- Plain red (C_bb)\n- Plain brown (ccBB)\n- Checkered brown (ccbb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F1, all are CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (25% each).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- Cc (from cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nSo, the probabilities are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nNow, applying dominance for each gene:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC and Cc \u2192 dominant (red)\n- cc \u2192 recessive (plain)\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB and Bb \u2192 dominant (brown)\n- bb \u2192 recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these:\n\n1. CC (red) \u2192 Checkered if B is present?\nNo, the presence of a dominant allele for any gene determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, it expresses the corresponding phenotype.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes as before.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nTotal F2 population is 100% split into:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nBecause:\n\n- CC: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since dominant for C).\n- Cc: Checkered (c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since dominant for C).\n- cc: Checkered (c is recessive, making it checkered), and brown (since dominant for B).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. For gene C:\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, for a bird to be Checkered red, it must have at least one dominant allele for both genes, i.e., CC or Cc.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown requires at least one dominant allele for gene B, regardless of gene C. So, it's ccBB or ccBb.\n\nPlain red requires at least one dominant allele for gene C, regardless of gene B. So, it's CC or Cc, but without the recessive for B.\n\nPlain brown requires at least one dominant allele for gene B, regardless of gene C. So, it's B_ and bb, but without the recessive for C.\n\nWait, no. Because the recessive phenotype overrides. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, it will express that phenotype.\n\nSo, the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: Presence of dominant C and dominant B \u2192 CC or Cc, and BB or Bb \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: Presence of dominant C (so 25%) and recessive B (so 25%) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Plain brown: Presence of recessive C (25%) and dominant B (75%) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Checkered brown: Presence of recessive C (25%) and recessive B (25%) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 50%, which doesn't account for the other 50%.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total F2 is 100%, so my earlier calculation might be wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me use a Punnett square approach instead of trying to calculate percentages directly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. It can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB (same as CB). So, F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- CC: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since dominant C \u2192 red)\n- Cc: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since dominant C \u2192 red)\n- cc: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and brown (since dominant B \u2192 brown)\n\nSo, now, the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 Checkered red\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nAdditionally, what about the presence of dominant B? For example, ccB_ would be brown, but since in our case, the recessive alleles are for both genes, none of the F2 will have ccB_ because all F2 are either CC, Cc, or cc. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc. So, for the purpose of determining the phenotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (since B is present)\n- Cc: Checkered red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Checkered brown (since B is present)\n\nBecause even though B is present in some cases, the recessive allele causes it to be checkered. So, all three phenotypes are Checkered except for the brown ones, which occur when both genes are recessive.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered (c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Checkered (c is recessive, making it checkered), and brown (since B is dominant)\n\nSo, all three phenotypes are Checkered except for the brown ones, which require both genes to be recessive. But in F2, the only way to have both genes recessive is if the bird is cc, which occurs in 25% of the population. But in terms of phenotype, the presence of recessive alleles causes it to be checkered, so all three phenotypes are Checkered. The brown phenotype appears only when the bird is ccBB or ccBb, but in our case, all F2 are cc, so all are Checkered. Wait, that can't be right because in reality, some F2 birds would be brown if they have dominant B.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. In F2, the only way to have brown is to have at least one dominant allele for B. But in F2, the presence of B is variable depending on the genotype. Let me consider each genotype:\n\n- CC: Always Checkered red (since C is dominant, and c makes it checkered)\n- Cc: Always Checkered red (same reason)\n- cc: Can be Checkered brown or brown, depending on B.\n\nWait, no. For cc:\n\n- If it has dominant B (i.e., B_), it will be brown.\n- If it has recessive B (i.e., bb), it will be checkered brown.\n\nBut in F2, the only way to have bb is through the aa cross, but in this case, all F2 are cc. So, does that mean all F2 are Checkered brown? That can't be right because some would have dominant B.\n\nWait, no, in F2, all individuals are either CC, Cc, or cc. So, for cc:\n\n- If they have dominant B (i.e., B_), they are brown.\n- If they have recessive B (i.e., bb), they are checkered brown.\n\nBut in F2, all individuals are cc. So, how many are brown vs. checkered brown?\n\nWait, that's impossible unless the cross includes a source of B. But in this case, the F2 is derived solely from F1 (CcBb) selfing, so all F2 are cc. Thus, in F2, the only way to have B is through the presence of B in the genotype. But since all F2 are cc, they don't have B. So, how do they get brown?\n\nAh, wait! This is a confusion point. The actual F2 generation isn't all cc. Wait, no, because the F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 includes all possible combinations. Specifically, the F2 will include:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nBut each of these has the possibility of having dominant B. For example, CC has B, Cc has B (if C is dominant, then yes), and cc has B only if they have at least one dominant B allele, which they don't because they are cc. Wait, no. If a bird is cc, they can't have B, because their alleles are c and c. So, how do they get brown? They must have at least one dominant allele for B. But in F2, all are cc, so they can't have B. Wait, this suggests that F2 cannot have brown, which contradicts the earlier assumption. But that can't be right because in reality, F2 should have some brown birds due to being ccBB or ccBb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. The F1 is CcBb, so the possible gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo, the F2 consists of CC, Cc, and cc. Now, considering dominance:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (c recessive, making it checkered; and C dominant, making it red)\n- Cc: Checkered red (c recessive, making it checkered; and C dominant, making it red)\n- cc: Checkered brown (c recessive, making it checkered; and B absent, making it brown)\n\nWait, but how come in F2, the cc individuals can't have B? Because the F2 generation only includes cc from the F1's gametes, which are all c. So, how do they get brown? They can't because they don't have B alleles. So, in F2, all birds are either Checkered red or Checkered brown. But that contradicts the idea that some F2 birds have brown. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me reconsider the F2 cross. The F1 is CcBb, so when it selfs, the F2 includes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nBut each of these has a chance to have B or not. For CC and Cc, B is always present (since they are C and Cc, respectively), so they are brown. For cc, B is not present, so they are checkered brown. Therefore, in F2, half of the population (50%) will be Checkered red, and the other half (50%) will be Checkered brown. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum would be 100%. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, because:\n\n- CC: 25% of F2\n- Cc: 50% of F2\n- cc: 25% of F2\n\nOf these:\n\n- CC and Cc: Checkered red (since they have B)\n- cc: Checkered brown (since they don't have B)\n\nSo, in terms of phenotype distribution:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (CC",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the problem states that the parents are homozygous, so the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene independently. But since there are two genes, the total phenotypic ratio could be different.\n\nWait, but the user already provided a detailed set of gametes for F1, so perhaps they're considering all possible gamete combinations beyond F1. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the F2 phenotype ratio after considering the possible F2 genotypes. Let me try to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, determine the genotypes of the parents:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Homozygous dominant for both genes.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Homozygous recessive for both genes.\n\nThe F1 results from crossing these two parents: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. Since both parents are homozygous, the F1 will be CcBb, as each allele is passed on equally. The F1 will produce four types of gametes: CB and cb, each occurring at 50% probability.\n\nNow, F1 (CcBb) will self-fertilize to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC\n- From CB + cb = Cc\n- From cb + CB = Cc\n- From cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and cc. Now, considering dominance and recessiveness:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC and Cc \u2192 dominant (red)\n- cc \u2192 recessive (plain)\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB and Bb \u2192 dominant (brown)\n- bb \u2192 recessive (checkered)\n\nSo each bird has two genes. The phenotype is determined by both genes. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red) \u2192 Checkered if B is present?\nWait, no. Wait, the checkered refers to the recessive allele, which is c. So, the presence of c (recessive allele) makes the bird checkered. The color depends on B and b. So, for the phenotype, it's a combination of both genes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on both gene interactions. For each gene:\n\nGene C: \n- C \u2192 red (dominant)\n- c \u2192 plain (recessive)\n\nGene B:\n- B \u2192 brown (dominant)\n- b \u2192 checkered (recessive)\n\nEach gene interaction follows the rules where the dominant allele masks the recessive one. So, for example, if a bird has both B and c alleles, it'll be brown. If it has both c and c, it'll be plain. Similarly for gene C.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: C_B_ \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. Gene C dominant, gene B recessive: C_bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. Gene C recessive, gene B dominant: ccBB \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. Both genes recessive: ccbb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no. Actually, the recessive phenotype overrides the dominant one. So, for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will display the corresponding phenotype. Let me re-express this properly:\n\nFor each gene:\n- C (C or C_) \u2192 red\n- c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\n- B (B or B_) \u2192 brown\n- b (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C_B_: Both genes have dominant alleles \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C_bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. ccBB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. ccbb: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nBut wait, in reality, a bird cannot have both recessive alleles for both genes because the recessive allele is dominant over the dominant one. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele in either gene will express the phenotype associated with those alleles.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\na. Checkered red (C c and b b)\nb. Plain red (C c and B b)\nc. Plain brown (c c and B b)\nd. Plain brown (c c and b b) \u2014 same as c?\n\nWait, no. Let me make a table:\n\nEach bird will have two genes. The phenotype is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes have dominant alleles (C and B): Checkered red (because c is present, making the bird checkered)\n2. Only gene C has dominant (C_ and B_): Red\n3. Only gene B has dominant (C_ and B_): Brown\n4. Neither gene has dominant (c c and b b): Checkered brown\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to the corresponding phenotype. So, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for gene C, it's red. If it also has at least one dominant allele for gene B, it's brown. If neither has dominant alleles, it's checkered brown.\n\nWait, but if a bird has dominant allele for gene C but not for gene B, it's red. If it has dominant for gene B but not C, it's brown. If it has neither, it's checkered brown.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant: Checkered red (c present, making it checkered, and both brown)\n2. Only gene C dominant: Red (no B dominant, so checkered brown becomes plain red)\n3. Only gene B dominant: Brown (no C dominant, so red becomes plain brown)\n4. Neither gene dominant: Checkered brown (both c and b present)\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting. Let me take an example bird. Suppose a bird has allele C and c, and B and b. It would have both dominant alleles, so it's red and brown, making it checkered red. Another bird has C and c, and b and b: It's red and checkered, making it plain red. A bird with c and c, and B and b: It's plain brown. And a bird with c and c, and b and b: It's checkered brown.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_)\n- Plain red (C_bb)\n- Plain brown (ccBB)\n- Checkered brown (ccbb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nIn F1, all are CcBb, which produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts (25% each).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- Cc (from cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nSo, the probabilities are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nNow, applying dominance for each gene:\n\nFor gene C:\n- CC and Cc \u2192 dominant (red)\n- cc \u2192 recessive (plain)\n\nFor gene B:\n- BB and Bb \u2192 dominant (brown)\n- bb \u2192 recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the combination of these:\n\n1. CC (red) \u2192 Checkered if B is present?\nNo, the presence of a dominant allele for any gene determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, it expresses the corresponding phenotype.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes as before.\n\nNow, let's compute the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nTotal F2 population is 100% split into:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- 50% Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- 25% cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nBecause:\n\n- CC: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since dominant for C).\n- Cc: Checkered (c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since dominant for C).\n- cc: Checkered (c is recessive, making it checkered), and brown (since dominant for B).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. For gene C:\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 plain\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, for a bird to be Checkered red, it must have at least one dominant allele for both genes, i.e., CC or Cc.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown requires at least one dominant allele for gene B, regardless of gene C. So, it's ccBB or ccBb.\n\nPlain red requires at least one dominant allele for gene C, regardless of gene B. So, it's CC or Cc, but without the recessive for B.\n\nPlain brown requires at least one dominant allele for gene B, regardless of gene C. So, it's B_ and bb, but without the recessive for C.\n\nWait, no. Because the recessive phenotype overrides. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, it will express that phenotype.\n\nSo, the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: Presence of dominant C and dominant B \u2192 CC or Cc, and BB or Bb \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Plain red: Presence of dominant C (so 25%) and recessive B (so 25%) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Plain brown: Presence of recessive C (25%) and dominant B (75%) \u2192 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Checkered brown: Presence of recessive C (25%) and recessive B (25%) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 18.75 + 6.25 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 50%, which doesn't account for the other 50%.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total F2 is 100%, so my earlier calculation might be wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me use a Punnett square approach instead of trying to calculate percentages directly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. It can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB (same as CB). So, F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB + CB = CC\n- CB + cb = Cc\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- CC: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since dominant C \u2192 red)\n- Cc: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since dominant C \u2192 red)\n- cc: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and brown (since dominant B \u2192 brown)\n\nSo, now, the phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 Checkered red\n3. cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nAdditionally, what about the presence of dominant B? For example, ccB_ would be brown, but since in our case, the recessive alleles are for both genes, none of the F2 will have ccB_ because all F2 are either CC, Cc, or cc. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc. So, for the purpose of determining the phenotype:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (since B is present)\n- Cc: Checkered red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Checkered brown (since B is present)\n\nBecause even though B is present in some cases, the recessive allele causes it to be checkered. So, all three phenotypes are Checkered except for the brown ones, which occur when both genes are recessive.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered (since c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered (c is recessive, making it checkered), and red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Checkered (c is recessive, making it checkered), and brown (since B is dominant)\n\nSo, all three phenotypes are Checkered except for the brown ones, which require both genes to be recessive. But in F2, the only way to have both genes recessive is if the bird is cc, which occurs in 25% of the population. But in terms of phenotype, the presence of recessive alleles causes it to be checkered, so all three phenotypes are Checkered. The brown phenotype appears only when the bird is ccBB or ccBb, but in our case, all F2 are cc, so all are Checkered. Wait, that can't be right because in reality, some F2 birds would be brown if they have dominant B.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. In F2, the only way to have brown is to have at least one dominant allele for B. But in F2, the presence of B is variable depending on the genotype. Let me consider each genotype:\n\n- CC: Always Checkered red (since C is dominant, and c makes it checkered)\n- Cc: Always Checkered red (same reason)\n- cc: Can be Checkered brown or brown, depending on B.\n\nWait, no. For cc:\n\n- If it has dominant B (i.e., B_), it will be brown.\n- If it has recessive B (i.e., bb), it will be checkered brown.\n\nBut in F2, the only way to have bb is through the aa cross, but in this case, all F2 are cc. So, does that mean all F2 are Checkered brown? That can't be right because some would have dominant B.\n\nWait, no, in F2, all individuals are either CC, Cc, or cc. So, for cc:\n\n- If they have dominant B (i.e., B_), they are brown.\n- If they have recessive B (i.e., bb), they are checkered brown.\n\nBut in F2, all individuals are cc. So, how many are brown vs. checkered brown?\n\nWait, that's impossible unless the cross includes a source of B. But in this case, the F2 is derived solely from F1 (CcBb) selfing, so all F2 are cc.

Specifically, the F2 will include:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb and cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nBut each of these has the possibility of having dominant B. For example, CC has B, Cc has B (if C is dominant, then yes), and cc has B only if they have at least one dominant B allele, which they don't because they are cc. Wait, no. If a bird is cc, they can't have B, because their alleles are c and c. So, how do they get brown? They must have at least one dominant allele for B. But in F2, all are cc, so they can't have B. Wait, this suggests that F2 cannot have brown, which contradicts the earlier assumption.

Because the F2 generation only includes cc from the F1's gametes, which are all c. So, how do they get brown? They can't because they don't have B alleles. So, in F2, all birds are either Checkered red or Checkered brown. But that contradicts the idea that some F2 birds have brown. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me reconsider the F2 cross.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the probabilities would be different.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the probabilities would be different. However, since both parents are homozygous, the segregation might be simpler. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only make CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, making only cb gametes. Thus, F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the gametes would be CB and cb in equal amounts (since both parents are homozygous and can only pass either CB or cb). Therefore, the F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): occurs 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): occurs 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): occurs 25%\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because if both parents can only produce CB and cb, then the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: (CB)(CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc: (CB)(cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc: (cb)(cb) \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but then the F2 would have a 25% chance for each genotype. Now, what about phenotypes? Let's map the genotypes to the phenotype rules given.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment color (dominant B):\n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n- Pigmentation (dominant C):\n  - Dominant (C) \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC:\n   - Both C alleles.\n   - Pigment color: C (Red)\n   - Pigmentation: C (Red)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n2. Cc:\n   - One C and one c.\n   - Pigment color: C (Red)\n   - Pigmentation: c (Plain)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n3. cc:\n   - Both c alleles.\n   - Pigment color: c (Checkered)\n   - Pigmentation: c (Plain)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\n4. BB:\n   - Wait, no\u2014wait, the genotype is CC, not BB. Because each bird has two alleles. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red\n- Cc: Checkered Red\n- cc: Checkered Checkered\n\nNow, looking at the probabilities:\n\n- 25% CC: Checkered Red\n- 50% Cc: Checkered Red\n- 25% cc: Checkered Checkered\n\nSo, in F2, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75% (25% + 50% = 75%)\n- Checkered Checkered: 25%\n\nBut wait, the options don't include 75% Checkered Red and 25% Checkered Checkered. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nLooking at the options (A to H):\n\nOption D says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, that seems inconsistent with my calculation. Maybe I missed something in the problem statement. Let me double-check.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (hom homozygous dominant) and cc bb (hom homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, as previously thought. Then F1 selfing would lead to F2. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but rather, the first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb, leading to F1 being CcBb. Then, F1 selfing leads to the F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a typo in the problem, and the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 being CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would produce F2, whose phenotypic ratio could be calculated differently. Let me try recalculating.\n\nIn F1, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So, F2 would consist of four types of genotypes:\n\n- CC: (CB)(CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc: (CB)(cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc: (cb)(cb) \u2192 25%\n\nAs before, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (both C and b alleles, B dominant, C dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered Red (C dominant, b recessive)\n- cc: Checkered Checkered (both c)\n\nThus, phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75%\n- Checkered Checkered: 25%\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions A to H have various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc., up to 12:2:2:0. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which sounds like a tri-hybrid cross, but our case is a dihybrid cross with two traits. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous, and the second is cc bb, also homozygous. That seems correct. Then, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb x CcBb.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider the dominance hierarchy correctly. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: The checkered pattern is due to gene C, and plain color due to c. Red is dominant B, brown is recessive b. So, the presence of B overrides c, and presence of C overrides b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by which alleles are present. If both B and C are present, the bird is brown-red, otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014the bird's color is determined by the combination of B and c and C and b. So, for example:\n\nIf the bird has at least one B (B_), it is brown. Additionally, if it has at least one C (C_), it is red. So, the phenotype is brown-red (if B is present) regardless of C, but the exact color depends on whether C is present. Similarly, if B is absent, it's plain, and if C is absent, it's checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined as follows:\n\n- If B is present (B_), then checkered becomes brown. So, if B is present and C is present (B_), it's brown-red. If B is present and C is absent (B_), it's brown-checkered.\n\n- If B is absent (b_), then checkered becomes plain. So, if C is present (C_), it's red plain. If C is absent (C_), it's plain checkered.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of B and C. So, let's list them:\n\n1. B_ and C_: brown-red\n2. B_ and cc (but wait, C is dominant, so even without C, if B is present, it's brown-red. If C is absent, it's brown-checkered.)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3. bb and C_: red plain (because B is absent, but C is present, so C is red)\n4. bb and cc: plain checkered (both B and C are absent)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n\n- Presence of B (B_) \u2192 brown\n  - Presence of C (C_) \u2192 red\n    \u2192 Phenotype: brown-red\n  - Absence of C (cc) \u2192 brown-checkered\n- Absence of B (b_) \u2192 plain\n  - Presence of C (C_) \u2192 red\n    \u2192 Phenotype: red plain\n  - Absence of C (cc) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown-Red (B_ and C_)\n2. Brown-Checkered (B_ and cc)\n3. Red-Plain (b_ and C_)\n4. Plain-Checkered (b_ and cc)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, we need the genotype frequencies in F2:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfed, the F2 would have the following genotype frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, let's map these to the four phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Checkered Red): Phenotype 1 (25%)\n2. Cc (Checkered Red): Phenotype 1 (50%)\n3. cc (Checkered Checkered): Phenotype 3 (25%)\n\nWait, but according to the rules above, cc (Checkered) would fall under brown-Checkered. Hmm, confusion arises here. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotype is determined by any dominant allele. So, for each gene separately:\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n\n- B_ \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 plain\n\nFor Gene C (pigmentation):\n\n- C_ \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nBut the overall phenotype combines both. So, if a bird has at least one B and at least one C, it's brown-red. If it has at least one B and no C, it's brown-checkered. If it has no B but at least one C, it's red plain. If it has neither B nor C, it's plain-checkered.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. B_ and C_: Brown-Red\n2. B_ and cc: Brown-Checkered\n3. bb and C_: Red-Plain\n4. bb and cc: Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, calculating the frequency for each phenotype:\n\n1. Brown-Red: All birds where B is present and C is present.\n   - Frequency: Probability of having at least one B (B_) times probability of having at least one C (C_).\n   - Probability of B_: 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n   - Probability of C_: 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n   - So, Brown-Red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Brown-Checkered: B present, C absent.\n   - Probability of B_: 3/4\n   - Probability of C (cc): 1/4\n   - So, Brown-Checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Red-Plain: C present, B absent.\n   - Probability of C_: 3/4\n   - Probability of B (bb): 1/4\n   - So, Red-Plain: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain-Checkered: Neither B nor C present.\n   - Probability of bb: 1/4\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - So, Plain-Checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but hold on: The sum of these probabilities should add up to 1. Let's check:\n\n9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. Correct.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nBrown-Red : Brown-Checkered : Red-Plain : Plain-Checkered = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option G: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nWait, but checking the options again, option G says checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nHowever, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user included an initial setup with gametes and a Punnett square, but then proceeded to ask about the F2 generation. The options provided do include option G as a possible answer. But let me confirm once more.\n\nAnother way to approach this is by considering the dihybrid cross. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be determined by squaring that.\n\nWhen squaring CcBb, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: (C)(C) \u2192 25%\n- Cc: (C)(c) \u2192 50%\n- cc: (c)(c) \u2192 25%\n\nThen, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (B_ and C_)\n- Cc: Checkered Red (B_ and cc)\n- cc: Checkered Checkered (B_ and cc)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to stick with the previous analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms earlier. Let me ensure clarity:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the phenotypes are as per the rules:\n\n1. B_ and C_: brown-red\n2. B_ and cc: brown-checkered\n3. cc and C_: red-plain\n4. cc and cc: plain-checkered\n\nSo, the frequencies are indeed 9:3:3:1, matching option G.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". This aligns perfectly with our calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the probabilities would be different. However, since both parents are homozygous, the segregation might be simpler. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only make CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, making only cb gametes. Thus, F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the gametes would be CB and cb in equal amounts (since both parents are homozygous and can only pass either CB or cb). Therefore, the F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): occurs 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): occurs 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): occurs 25%\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because if both parents can only produce CB and cb, then the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: (CB)(CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc: (CB)(cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc: (cb)(cb) \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but then the F2 would have a 25% chance for each genotype. Now, what about phenotypes? Let's map the genotypes to the phenotype rules given.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigment color (dominant B):\n  - Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n- Pigmentation (dominant C):\n  - Dominant (C) \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC:\n   - Both C alleles.\n   - Pigment color: C (Red)\n   - Pigmentation: C (Red)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n2. Cc:\n   - One C and one c.\n   - Pigment color: C (Red)\n   - Pigmentation: c (Plain)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red\n\n3. cc:\n   - Both c alleles.\n   - Pigment color: c (Checkered)\n   - Pigmentation: c (Plain)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\n4. BB:\n   - Wait, no\u2014wait, the genotype is CC, not BB. Because each bird has two alleles. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red\n- Cc: Checkered Red\n- cc: Checkered Checkered\n\nNow, looking at the probabilities:\n\n- 25% CC: Checkered Red\n- 50% Cc: Checkered Red\n- 25% cc: Checkered Checkered\n\nSo, in F2, the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75% (25% + 50% = 75%)\n- Checkered Checkered: 25%\n\nBut wait, the options don't include 75% Checkered Red and 25% Checkered Checkered. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nLooking at the options (A to H):\n\nOption D says Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, that seems inconsistent with my calculation. Maybe I missed something in the problem statement. Let me double-check.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (hom homozygous dominant) and cc bb (hom homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, as previously thought. Then F1 selfing would lead to F2. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous, but rather, the first parent is CC BB, and the second is cc bb, leading to F1 being CcBb. Then, F1 selfing leads to the F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a typo in the problem, and the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 being CcBb. Then, F1 selfing would produce F2, whose phenotypic ratio could be calculated differently. Let me try recalculating.\n\nIn F1, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So, F2 would consist of four types of genotypes:\n\n- CC: (CB)(CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc: (CB)(cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc: (cb)(cb) \u2192 25%\n\nAs before, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (both C and b alleles, B dominant, C dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered Red (C dominant, b recessive)\n- cc: Checkered Checkered (both c)\n\nThus, phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered Red: 75%\n- Checkered Checkered: 25%\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions A to H have various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc., up to 12:2:2:0. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which sounds like a tri-hybrid cross, but our case is a dihybrid cross with two traits. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is homozygous, and the second is cc bb, also homozygous. That seems correct. Then, F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb x CcBb.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider the dominance hierarchy correctly. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: The checkered pattern is due to gene C, and plain color due to c. Red is dominant B, brown is recessive b. So, the presence of B overrides c, and presence of C overrides b.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by which alleles are present. If both B and C are present, the bird is brown-red, otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014the bird's color is determined by the combination of B and c and C and b. So, for example:\n\nIf the bird has at least one B (B_), it is brown. Additionally, if it has at least one C (C_), it is red. So, the phenotype is brown-red (if B is present) regardless of C, but the exact color depends on whether C is present. Similarly, if B is absent, it's plain, and if C is absent, it's checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined as follows:\n\n- If B is present (B_), then checkered becomes brown. So, if B is present and C is present (B_), it's brown-red. If B is present and C is absent (B_), it's brown-checkered.\n\n- If B is absent (b_), then checkered becomes plain. So, if C is present (C_), it's red plain. If C is absent (C_), it's plain checkered.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence or absence of B and C. So, let's list them:\n\n1. B_ and C_: brown-red\n2. B_ and cc (but wait, C is dominant, so even without C, if B is present, it's brown-red. If C is absent, it's brown-checkered.)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3. bb and C_: red plain (because B is absent, but C is present, so C is red)\n4. bb and cc: plain checkered (both B and C are absent)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n\n- Presence of B (B_) \u2192 brown\n  - Presence of C (C_) \u2192 red\n    \u2192 Phenotype: brown-red\n  - Absence of C (cc) \u2192 brown-checkered\n- Absence of B (b_) \u2192 plain\n  - Presence of C (C_) \u2192 red\n    \u2192 Phenotype: red plain\n  - Absence of C (cc) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown-Red (B_ and C_)\n2. Brown-Checkered (B_ and cc)\n3. Red-Plain (b_ and C_)\n4. Plain-Checkered (b_ and cc)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, we need the genotype frequencies in F2:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfed, the F2 would have the following genotype frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, let's map these to the four phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Checkered Red): Phenotype 1 (25%)\n2. Cc (Checkered Red): Phenotype 1 (50%)\n3. cc (Checkered Checkered): Phenotype 3 (25%)\n\nWait, but according to the rules above, cc (Checkered) would fall under brown-Checkered. Hmm, confusion arises here. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotype is determined by any dominant allele. So, for each gene separately:\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n\n- B_ \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 plain\n\nFor Gene C (pigmentation):\n\n- C_ \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nBut the overall phenotype combines both. So, if a bird has at least one B and at least one C, it's brown-red. If it has at least one B and no C, it's brown-checkered. If it has no B but at least one C, it's red plain. If it has neither B nor C, it's plain-checkered.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. B_ and C_: Brown-Red\n2. B_ and cc: Brown-Checkered\n3. bb and C_: Red-Plain\n4. bb and cc: Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, calculating the frequency for each phenotype:\n\n1. Brown-Red: All birds where B is present and C is present.\n   - Frequency: Probability of having at least one B (B_) times probability of having at least one C (C_).\n   - Probability of B_: 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n   - Probability of C_: 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4\n   - So, Brown-Red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Brown-Checkered: B present, C absent.\n   - Probability of B_: 3/4\n   - Probability of C (cc): 1/4\n   - So, Brown-Checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Red-Plain: C present, B absent.\n   - Probability of C_: 3/4\n   - Probability of B (bb): 1/4\n   - So, Red-Plain: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain-Checkered: Neither B nor C present.\n   - Probability of bb: 1/4\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - So, Plain-Checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but hold on: The sum of these probabilities should add up to 1. Let's check:\n\n9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. Correct.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to ratios:\n\nBrown-Red : Brown-Checkered : Red-Plain : Plain-Checkered = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option G: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nWait, but checking the options again, option G says checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nHowever, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user included an initial setup with gametes and a Punnett square, but then proceeded to ask about the F2 generation. The options provided do include option G as a possible answer. But let me confirm once more.\n\nAnother way to approach this is by considering the dihybrid cross. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So, their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be determined by squaring that.\n\nWhen squaring CcBb, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: (C)(C) \u2192 25%\n- Cc: (C)(c) \u2192 50%\n- cc: (c)(c) \u2192 25%\n\nThen, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered Red (B_ and C_)\n- Cc: Checkered Red (B_ and cc)\n- cc: Checkered Checkered (B_ and cc)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to stick with the previous analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the terms earlier. Let me ensure clarity:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the phenotypes are as per the rules:\n\n1. B_ and C_: brown-red\n2. B_ and cc: brown-checkered\n3. cc and C_: red-plain\n4. cc and cc: plain-checkered\n\nSo, the frequencies are indeed 9:3:3:1, matching option G.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". This aligns perfectly with our calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes might not express certain traits.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes might not express certain traits. Wait, but the problem asks for phenotypic ratios, not genetic ones. So we'll proceed.\n\nNow, let's map the phenotypes. The birds are checkedered if they have the 'c' allele (recessive) for both C and B. They are plain red if they have the 'c' allele (recessive) for C but the 'b' allele (recessive) for B. Brown would be if they have the 'B' allele (dominant) for B but the 'c' (recessive) for C. Checkered would be if they have both 'c' alleles. \n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. Cc BB: Checkered brown\n3. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n4. Cc Bb: Plain red\n5. cc BB: Checkered red\n6. cc Bb: Checkered brown\n7. cc bb: Plain red\n8. cc bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me clarify: The phenotype depends on whether the individual has either 'c' or 'b' alleles. If they have 'c', regardless of 'B', they are checkered. If they have 'b', regardless of 'C', they are brown. If they have neither 'c' nor 'b', they are plain red. So the genotypes for each trait would be:\n\n- Checkered (both 'c'): cc\n- Brown (only 'B'): Bb (but since 'c' is present, they're brown)\n- Plain red (no 'c' or 'b'): rr (but since there's always at least one allele, it's actually checkered if both are 'c', otherwise, if any 'c' or 'b', they are brown or checkered).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list the phenotypes based on presence of 'c' and 'b':\n\nEach bird has three possible alleles: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b.\n\nBut since we're dealing with two genes, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both 'c': Checkered\n2. At least one 'c' and at least one 'b': Brown\n3. Neither 'c' nor 'b': Plain red\n\nWait, but checking the dominance hierarchy: If a bird is C_B_, then it's brown. If it's C_b_, then it's brown if it has at least one 'b'. Wait, no: The presence of 'c' makes them checkered, and presence of 'b' makes them brown. If they have neither, they're plain red.\n\nWait, let me clarify the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- The 'C' gene determines pigment color:\n  - C_: Dominant, red\n  - cc_: Recessive, plain (since it's the recessive allele for C)\n\n- The 'B' gene determines color:\n  - B_: Dominant, brown\n  - bb_: Recessive, checkered\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered (both 'c') if it has cc.\n- Brown (at least one 'b') if it has B_.\n- Red (at least one 'c' and at least one 'b') if it has CB or Bb.\n- Plain red (neither 'c' nor 'b') if it has cc.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of alleles. So the F2 generation will have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: All individuals where both alleles are 'c' (cc). These will display both traits as checkered and red.\n2. Checkered brown: Individuals with 'c' (from 'c') and 'B' or 'b':\n   - cB (checkered brown)\n   - bb (checkered red)\n3. Plain red: Individuals without 'c' or 'b', i.e., cc.\n4. Brown: Any individual with at least one 'b', regardless of 'c'.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because even if someone has a 'c', if they also have a 'b', they are brown, but if they have a 'c' and not a 'b', they are checkered. Similarly, if they don't have a 'c' but have a 'b', they are brown. Only those who have neither 'c' nor 'b' are plain red.\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc (both alleles 'c')\n2. Checkered brown: cB (has 'c' and 'B'), and bb (has 'b' but not 'c')\n3. Plain red: cc (same as above)\nWait, no\u2014wait, 'cB' includes both 'c' and 'B', while 'bb' is another phenotype. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (all individuals with both alleles 'c')\n- Checkered brown: cB (individuals with 'c' and 'B')\n- Brown: individuals with 'c' and 'b' (cB or bb), plus those with 'b' and 'B' (bB), etc.\u2014wait, no, actually, any individual with at least one 'b' will be brown. Similarly, any individual with at least one 'c' will be checkered. So the distinction between brown and checkered comes from having 'b' or 'c' respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation is produced by F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Each F1 produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, each F1 can only produce CB and cb gametes because both parents are homozygous. So each gamete is either CB or cb, each occurring 50% of the time.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of 'c' and 'b' alleles. So, among the F2:\n\n- Checkered red: only those who have both 'c' alleles, i.e., cc. There's a 25% chance for this.\n- Checkered brown: those who have 'c' but not 'b', i.e., cB. This occurs when a parent contributes CB and the other cb. So, how many such gametes? Well, each F1 can contribute CB or cb. So for F2, the proportion of cB is 25%, same as cc. So total checkered brown is 25% (cc) + 25% (cB) = 50%?\nWait, no\u2014because each F1 contributes CB or cb, so when multiplied, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), bb (25%)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- bb: Brown\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of 'c' leads to checkering, and presence of 'b' leads to brown. So the phenotype is determined by the combination:\n\n- If both 'c' \u2192 Checkered red\n- If 'c' and 'b' \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If 'b' and/or 'c' \u2192 Brown\n- If neither 'c' nor 'b' \u2192 Plain red\n\nBut according to the dominance hierarchy, the order matters. Since 'c' takes precedence over 'b', individuals with 'c' will be checkered, and those with 'b' will be brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has 'c' or 'b' alleles.\n\nThus, in the F2:\n\n- Checkered red: Only those with both 'c' alleles \u2192 cc (25%)\n- Checkered brown: Those with 'c' and 'B' \u2192 cB (25%)\n- Brown: Those with 'c' and 'b' or 'b' and 'B' \u2192 cB and bb (total 50%)\n- Plain red: Those with 'b' and 'c'? No\u2014wait, plain red is when neither 'c' nor 'b' is present, i.e., cc. But wait, in our case, the F2 includes cc, which would be plain red. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nBut looking back at the options given, option D says \"Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems off because my calculation suggests 25% each for checkered red, brown, and plain red, and 50% brown. None of the options seem to match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the F2 generation will have different probabilities due to independent assortment. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 Brown\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match this distribution except option D, which has Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Maybe I need to consider the actual phenotypic expression based on the presence of 'c' and 'b' alleles without relying solely on dominance.\n\nIn reality, the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one 'c' (checkered) or at least one 'b' (brown). So:\n\n- Checkered red: only when both 'c' alleles are present \u2192 cc (25%)\n- Checkered brown: when 'c' is present and 'b' is absent \u2192 cB (25%)\n- Brown: when 'c' is present and 'b' is present \u2192 cB or bb (50%)\n- Plain red: when neither 'c' nor 'b' alleles are present \u2192 cc (25%)\n\nBut according to the options, none match this exact distribution. Option D has Checkered red 1, which seems too low compared to others. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question's requirements.\n\nWait, the user provided an initial set of gametes, including CB, cb, cB, and cb. So when creating the Punnett square, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThese correspond to:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- bb: Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 1 (if assuming 100 individuals)\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 1\n- Brown: 50% \u2192 2\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 1\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options provided. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192 Total 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192 Total 16\n\nHmm, the total must sum to 16. If the F2 generation has 16 birds, the options suggest varying distributions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The question mentions a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C_ B_)\n- 25% Cc (C_ bb)\n- 25% cc (cc BB)\n- 25% bb (cc Bb)\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- bb: Brown\n\nSo phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nIf we take 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Brown: 8\n- Plain red: 4\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1\u2192 Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 16, but the numbers don't align with my previous reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine:\n\n- In F2, the genotypes are:\n\n  - CC: Checkered red (because both 'c' alleles)\n  - Cc: Checkered brown (because 'c' present, 'b' absent)\n  - cc: Plain red (because 'c' absent)\n  - bb: Brown (because 'b' present)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (assuming 16 birds)\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nWhich would translate to:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Brown: 8\n- Plain red: 4\n\nBut the options don't have this distribution. The closest option is Option C, which has Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 16 but doesn't match the expected 4,4,8,4. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider the phenotype based solely on the presence of 'c' or 'b' alleles, regardless of their dominance. So in that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: only when both 'c' alleles are present (cc): 25%\n- Checkered brown: when 'c' is present and 'b' is absent (cB): 25%\n- Brown: when 'c' is present and 'b' is present (cB or bb): 50%\n- Plain red: when neither 'c' nor 'b' are present (cc): 25%\n\nSo with 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Brown: 8\n- Plain red: 4\n\nAgain, none of the options match this. The closest option is Option C, which has Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to use a different approach. Let me consider that in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of 'c' and 'b' independently. So:\n\n- The probability of being checkered red (both 'c') is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- The probability of being checkered brown (c and B) is (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8\n- The probability of being brown (c and b or b and B) is (1/4) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8 + 1/4 = 3/8\n- The probability of being plain red (no 'c' or 'b') is (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nBut scaled up to 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Brown: 6\n- Plain red: 4\n\nStill not matching any options. Option D has Checkered red 1, which seems too low.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It says to show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Let's see what the options are.\n\nOption D states: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nThis totals 16, but the distribution isn't matching the standard Mendelian ratios. So perhaps the user wants a different approach, like considering the independent assortment and possible epistatic interactions. However, the problem doesn't mention any epistasis, so it's likely a simple dihybrid cross.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the user made a mistake in the initial F2 generation setup. Let me try recalculating.\n\nGiven the F1 is CcBb, selfing:\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (C_ B_)\n- 25% Cc (C_ bb)\n- 25% cc (cc BB)\n- 25% bb (cc Bb)\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 Brown\n\nSo phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nWith 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Brown: 8\n- Plain red: 4\n\nBut again, none of the options match this. Option C has Checkered red 9, which is higher than expected. Option D has Checkered red 1, which seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might not express certain traits. Wait, but the problem asks for phenotypic ratios, not genetic ones. So we'll proceed.\n\nNow, let's map the phenotypes. The birds are checkedered if they have the 'c' allele (recessive) for both C and B. They are plain red if they have the 'c' allele (recessive) for C but the 'b' allele (recessive) for B. Brown would be if they have the 'B' allele (dominant) for B but the 'c' (recessive) for C. Checkered would be if they have both 'c' alleles. \n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. Cc BB: Checkered brown\n3. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n4. Cc Bb: Plain red\n5. cc BB: Checkered red\n6. cc Bb: Checkered brown\n7. cc bb: Plain red\n8. cc bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me clarify: The phenotype depends on whether the individual has either 'c' or 'b' alleles. If they have 'c', regardless of 'B', they are checkered. If they have 'b', regardless of 'C', they are brown. If they have neither 'c' nor 'b', they are plain red. So the genotypes for each trait would be:\n\n- Checkered (both 'c'): cc\n- Brown (only 'B'): Bb (but since 'c' is present, they're brown)\n- Plain red (no 'c' or 'b'): rr (but since there's always at least one allele, it's actually checkered if both are 'c', otherwise, if any 'c' or 'b', they are brown or checkered).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to list the phenotypes based on presence of 'c' and 'b':\n\nEach bird has three possible alleles: C/B, C/b, c/B, c/b.\n\nBut since we're dealing with two genes, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both 'c': Checkered\n2. At least one 'c' and at least one 'b': Brown\n3. Neither 'c' nor 'b': Plain red\n\nWait, but checking the dominance hierarchy: If a bird is C_B_, then it's brown. If it's C_b_, then it's brown if it has at least one 'b'. Wait, no: The presence of 'c' makes them checkered, and presence of 'b' makes them brown. If they have neither, they're plain red.\n\nWait, let me clarify the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- The 'C' gene determines pigment color:\n  - C_: Dominant, red\n  - cc_: Recessive, plain (since it's the recessive allele for C)\n\n- The 'B' gene determines color:\n  - B_: Dominant, brown\n  - bb_: Recessive, checkered\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered (both 'c') if it has cc.\n- Brown (at least one 'b') if it has B_.\n- Red (at least one 'c' and at least one 'b') if it has CB or Bb.\n- Plain red (neither 'c' nor 'b') if it has cc.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of alleles. So the F2 generation will have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: All individuals where both alleles are 'c' (cc). These will display both traits as checkered and red.\n2. Checkered brown: Individuals with 'c' (from 'c') and 'B' or 'b':\n   - cB (checkered brown)\n   - bb (checkered red)\n3. Plain red: Individuals without 'c' or 'b', i.e., cc.\n4. Brown: Any individual with at least one 'b', regardless of 'c'.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because even if someone has a 'c', if they also have a 'b', they are brown, but if they have a 'c' and not a 'b', they are checkered. Similarly, if they don't have a 'c' but have a 'b', they are brown. Only those who have neither 'c' nor 'b' are plain red.\n\nSo, the F2 generation will have four phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc (both alleles 'c')\n2. Checkered brown: cB (has 'c' and 'B'), and bb (has 'b' but not 'c')\n3. Plain red: cc (same as above)\nWait, no\u2014wait, 'cB' includes both 'c' and 'B', while 'bb' is another phenotype. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (all individuals with both alleles 'c')\n- Checkered brown: cB (individuals with 'c' and 'B')\n- Brown: individuals with 'c' and 'b' (cB or bb), plus those with 'b' and 'B' (bB), etc.\u2014wait, no, actually, any individual with at least one 'b' will be brown. Similarly, any individual with at least one 'c' will be checkered. So the distinction between brown and checkered comes from having 'b' or 'c' respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation is produced by F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Each F1 produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, each F1 can only produce CB and cb gametes because both parents are homozygous. So each gamete is either CB or cb, each occurring 50% of the time.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of 'c' and 'b' alleles. So, among the F2:\n\n- Checkered red: only those who have both 'c' alleles, i.e., cc. There's a 25% chance for this.\n- Checkered brown: those who have 'c' but not 'b', i.e., cB. This occurs when a parent contributes CB and the other cb. So, how many such gametes? Well, each F1 can contribute CB or cb. So for F2, the proportion of cB is 25%, same as cc. So total checkered brown is 25% (cc) + 25% (cB) = 50%?\nWait, no\u2014because each F1 contributes CB or cb, so when multiplied, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), bb (25%)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- bb: Brown\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of 'c' leads to checkering, and presence of 'b' leads to brown. So the phenotype is determined by the combination:\n\n- If both 'c' \u2192 Checkered red\n- If 'c' and 'b' \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If 'b' and/or 'c' \u2192 Brown\n- If neither 'c' nor 'b' \u2192 Plain red\n\nBut according to the dominance hierarchy, the order matters. Since 'c' takes precedence over 'b', individuals with 'c' will be checkered, and those with 'b' will be brown. So the phenotype is determined by whether the bird has 'c' or 'b' alleles.\n\nThus, in the F2:\n\n- Checkered red: Only those with both 'c' alleles \u2192 cc (25%)\n- Checkered brown: Those with 'c' and 'B' \u2192 cB (25%)\n- Brown: Those with 'c' and 'b' or 'b' and 'B' \u2192 cB and bb (total 50%)\n- Plain red: Those with 'b' and 'c'? No\u2014wait, plain red is when neither 'c' nor 'b' is present, i.e., cc. But wait, in our case, the F2 includes cc, which would be plain red. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nBut looking back at the options given, option D says \"Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems off because my calculation suggests 25% each for checkered red, brown, and plain red, and 50% brown. None of the options seem to match exactly. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the F2 generation will have different probabilities due to independent assortment. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 Brown\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match this distribution except option D, which has Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Maybe I need to consider the actual phenotypic expression based on the presence of 'c' and 'b' alleles without relying solely on dominance.\n\nIn reality, the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one 'c' (checkered) or at least one 'b' (brown). So:\n\n- Checkered red: only when both 'c' alleles are present \u2192 cc (25%)\n- Checkered brown: when 'c' is present and 'b' is absent \u2192 cB (25%)\n- Brown: when 'c' is present and 'b' is present \u2192 cB or bb (50%)\n- Plain red: when neither 'c' nor 'b' alleles are present \u2192 cc (25%)\n\nBut according to the options, none match this exact distribution. Option D has Checkered red 1, which seems too low compared to others. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question's requirements.\n\nWait, the user provided an initial set of gametes, including CB, cb, cB, and cb. So when creating the Punnett square, the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThese correspond to:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- bb: Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% \u2192 1 (if assuming 100 individuals)\n- Checkered brown: 25% \u2192 1\n- Brown: 50% \u2192 2\n- Plain red: 25% \u2192 1\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options provided. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192 Total 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192 Total 16\n\nHmm, the total must sum to 16. If the F2 generation has 16 birds, the options suggest varying distributions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The question mentions a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (C_ B_)\n- 25% Cc (C_ bb)\n- 25% cc (cc BB)\n- 25% bb (cc Bb)\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Checkered brown\n- cc: Plain red\n- bb: Brown\n\nSo phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nIf we take 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Brown: 8\n- Plain red: 4\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1\u2192 Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 16, but the numbers don't align with my previous reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me re-examine:\n\n- In F2, the genotypes are:\n\n  - CC: Checkered red (because both 'c' alleles)\n  - Cc: Checkered brown (because 'c' present, 'b' absent)\n  - cc: Plain red (because 'c' absent)\n  - bb: Brown (because 'b' present)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (assuming 16 birds)\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nWhich would translate to:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Brown: 8\n- Plain red: 4\n\nBut the options don't have this distribution. The closest option is Option C, which has Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 16 but doesn't match the expected 4,4,8,4. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and consider the phenotype based solely on the presence of 'c' or 'b' alleles, regardless of their dominance. So in that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: only when both 'c' alleles are present (cc): 25%\n- Checkered brown: when 'c' is present and 'b' is absent (cB): 25%\n- Brown: when 'c' is present and 'b' is present (cB or bb): 50%\n- Plain red: when neither 'c' nor 'b' are present (cc): 25%\n\nSo with 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Brown: 8\n- Plain red: 4\n\nAgain, none of the options match this. The closest option is Option C, which has Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to use a different approach. Let me consider that in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of 'c' and 'b' independently. So:\n\n- The probability of being checkered red (both 'c') is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n- The probability of being checkered brown (c and B) is (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8\n- The probability of being brown (c and b or b and B) is (1/4) * (1/2) + (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8 + 1/4 = 3/8\n- The probability of being plain red (no 'c' or 'b') is (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nBut scaled up to 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Brown: 6\n- Plain red: 4\n\nStill not matching any options. Option D has Checkered red 1, which seems too low.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It says to show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Let's see what the options are.\n\nOption D states: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nThis totals 16, but the distribution isn't matching the standard Mendelian ratios. So perhaps the user wants a different approach, like considering the independent assortment and possible epistatic interactions. However, the problem doesn't mention any epistasis, so it's likely a simple dihybrid cross.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the user made a mistake in the initial F2 generation setup. Let me try recalculating.\n\nGiven the F1 is CcBb, selfing:\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (C_ B_)\n- 25% Cc (C_ bb)\n- 25% cc (cc BB)\n- 25% bb (cc Bb)\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 Brown\n\nSo phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Brown: 50%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nWith 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Brown: 8\n- Plain red: 4\n\nBut again, none of the options match this. Option C has Checkered red 9, which is higher than expected. Option D has Checkered red 1, which seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would include all combinations.",
    "rollout": " However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would include all combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the confusion arises because the F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the F2 phenotype ratios. The main idea is to determine the phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes. The dominant alleles (C and B) will result in certain colors and pigmentation. So, the phenotypes depend on whether the parents' alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- C_: dominant (red)\n- cc: recessive (plain)\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- B_: dominant (brown)\n- bb: recessive (checkered)\n\nThe F2 generation will involve the combination of these two genes. Since both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 will all be CcBb, and the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we'll consider the possible combinations of C and B traits. Each trait is determined independently, so we can use a Punnett square to calculate the probabilities.\n\nLet's construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\n- Rows represent the alleles from the first parent (let's say it's CcBb)\n- Columns represent the alleles from the second parent (also CcBb)\n- Each cell represents the combination of alleles from a parent contributing one.\n\nSo, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n        | C  | c \n--------|----|----\n      C  | CC | Cc \n--------|----|----\n      B  | CB | BB \n--------|----|----\n      b  | CB | bb \n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, the F2 square combines the alleles from both parents. Each parent contributes either C or c for gene C, and B or b for gene B. Since both parents are CcBb, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (if both parents contribute C)\n- Cc (if one parent contributes C and the other contributes c)\n- cc (if both parents contribute c)\n\nSimilarly for the B gene:\n\n- BB (both B)\n- Bb (one B and one b)\n- bb (none B)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the Punnett square will combine these possibilities. To get the phenotypes, we'll need to apply dominance rules:\n\n- For Pigmentation (C): C_ is dominant (red), cc is recessive (plain)\n- For Color (B): B_ is dominant (brown), bb is recessive (checkered)\n\nNow, let's determine the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered (Bb)**:\n   - Pigment: Checkered (since B is recessive)\n   - Color: Brown (since B is dominant)\n   - Genotype: Bb\n\n2. **Plain (cc)**:\n   - Pigment: Plain (since c is recessive)\n   - Color: Brown (since B is dominant, but the bird is plain)\n   - Genotype: cc\n\n3. **Red (Cc)**:\n   - Pigment: Red (since C is dominant)\n   - Color: Brown (since B is dominant, but the bird is red)\n   - Genotype: Cc\n\n4. **Brown (BB)**:\n   - Pigment: Brown (since B is dominant)\n   - Color: Brown (since B is dominant)\n   - Genotype: BB\n\nHowever, the description might be slightly different. Let me double-check the hierarchy of dominance. Typically, if there's another gene affecting pigment, it might override. But in this case, the presence of B (dominant) overrides the effect of C. So, regardless of whether C is present or not, if B is present, the bird will be brown. If B is absent, then C determines pigment, so C being present makes it red, and c makes it plain. \n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- **Checkered**: Only seen when both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b). So genotype: bb. Phenotype: Checkered (plain).\n- **Plain**: When B is recessive (b) but C is dominant (C). So genotype: Cb. Phenotype: Plain.\n- **Red**: When B is dominant (B) regardless of C. So genotype: C_, Phenotype: Red.\n- **Brown**: When B is dominant (B) and C is either dominant or recessive. So genotype: B_, Phenotype: Brown.\n\nWait, but according to the given options, some mention \"checkered\" and \"plain\" as separate categories. So perhaps the checkered refers to the absence of B (i.e., bb), while plain refers to the absence of C (i.e., Cb).\n\nIn any case, the key is to count how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category based on their genotypes.\n\nNow, constructing the Punnett square for F2:\n\nEach parent is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- For Gene C: CC, Cc, cc\n- For Gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThe Punnett square will have cells representing each possible combination:\n\n- Top row: CC, Cc, cc\n- Left column: BB, Bb, bb\n- Each cell combines a C/B allele from the top row with a C/B allele from the left column.\n\nSo, the Punnett square cells will contain the combined alleles:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain (because bb)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red (as B is dominant, so brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Brown (B dominant)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain (because cc)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Let me re-express the Punnett square correctly. Each parent is CcBb, so their gametes will be CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, their gametes will produce CB and cb for each gene. So the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- From Cc x Cc: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- From Bb x Bb: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThese combine to create the F2 genotype ratios:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you cross two heterozygotes, the F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc for each gene. Combining them, the F2 will have the following genotype ratios:\n\nFor Gene C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor Gene B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThus, the overall F2 genotypes are a combination of these, leading to:\n\n- 1/16 CC BB (Checkered, plain)\n- 1/16 CC Bb (Checkered, brown)\n- 1/16 CC bb (Plain, brown)\n- 1/16 Cc BB (Red, brown)\n- 1/16 Cc Bb (Red, brown)\n- 1/16 Cc bb (Plain, brown)\n- 1/16 cc BB (Plain, brown)\n- 1/16 cc Bb (Checkered, brown)\n- 1/16 cc bb (Checkered, plain)\n\nWait, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the F2 squares properly. The correct approach is to recognize that each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the segregation is CC : Cc : cc = 25%, 50%, 25%. Thus, for both genes, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each with equal probability of 1/16.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered (Bb)**: This occurs when both B is recessive (bb) and C is recessive (cc). Phenotype: Checkered (plain).\n2. **Plain (Cb)**: This occurs when B is dominant (B_) and C is recessive (cc). Phenotype: Plain.\n3. **Red (Cc)**: This occurs when B is dominant (B_) and C is dominant (CC). Phenotype: Red.\n4. **Brown (BB)**: This occurs when B is dominant (BB) or Bb. Phenotype: Brown.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Occurs in 1/16 of the population. So 1 out of 16.\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Occurs in 1/16. So 1 out of 16.\n- **Red (CR)**: Occurs in 1/16. So 1 out of 16.\n- **Brown (BB)**: Occurs in 1/4 of the population (since BB and Bb are 2/4 = 1/2). So 2 out of 16.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the above breakdown, each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n- **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n- **Red (CR)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16 \u2192 2\n\nAdding up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5. Hmm, that's inconsistent because the total should be 16. Wait, perhaps my earlier counting was wrong.\n\nWait, let's list each phenotype's count:\n\n1. **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n2. **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n3. **Red (CR)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n4. **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5, which isn't adding up to 16. That suggests an error in the way I've counted. Let me try again.\n\nActually, each phenotype group is:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16\n- **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16\n- **Red (CR)**: 1/16\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16\n\nBut wait, this adds up to 5/16, which leaves 11/16 unaccounted for. That must mean I missed some groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misclassified the phenotypes. Let me reassess:\n\nPhenotype classification:\n\n1. **Checkered**: Only when both alleles are recessive for B and C. So genotype: bb (for B) and cc (for C). Phenotype: Checkered (plain).\n2. **Plain**: When B is recessive (bb) and C is dominant (CC or Cc). Phenotype: Plain.\n3. **Red**: When B is dominant (B_ but C is recessive (cc)). Phenotype: Red.\n4. **Brown**: When B is dominant (B_) regardless of C. Phenotype: Brown.\n\nSo, the counts per phenotype are:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16\n- **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16\n- **Red (CR)**: 1/16\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16\n\nThis totals 5/16, which still doesn't add up. I must have made a mistake here. Perhaps I should consider that the phenotypes also include the coat color beyond pigment, but according to the question, it's about pigmentation. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy. If B is dominant, then brown is expressed over both plain and red. Similarly, if C is dominant, red is expressed over plain.\n\nSo, the correct phenotypes based on genotypes would be:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Only when B is recessive (bb) and C is recessive (cc). Phenotype: Checkered (plain).\n- **Plain (Cc)**: When B is recessive (bb) and C is dominant (CC or Cc). Phenotype: Plain.\n- **Red (CR)**: When B is dominant (B_) regardless of C. Phenotype: Red.\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: When B is dominant (B_) regardless of C. Phenotype: Brown.\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16\n- **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16\n- **Red (CR)**: 1/16\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16\n\nThis sums to 5/16, leaving 11/16 unaccounted. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Let's reconsider the F2 square.\n\nPerhaps I should approach it differently. Each gene segregates independently, so for Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. For Gene B: same. The F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each with equal frequency. Now, for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered (Bb)**: Occurs when B is recessive (bb) and C is recessive (cc). So, 1/16 of the population.\n2. **Plain (Cc)**: Occurs when B is recessive (bb) and C is dominant (CC or Cc). So, 1/16.\n3. **Red (CR)**: Occurs when B is dominant (B_) regardless of C. So, 2/16 (since both CC and Cc are red).\n4. **Brown (BB + Bb)**: Occurs when B is dominant (B_) regardless of C. Also 2/16.\n\nAdding these: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's wrong. Let me list all 16 possibilities:\n\nGenotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain (brown)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red (brown)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown (red)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain (brown)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4 cases\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3 cases\n- **Red (CR)**: Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 cases\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: Cases 6, 7, 8 \u2192 3 cases\n\nWait, this gives:\n\n- Checkered: 4\n- Plain: 3\n- Red: 2\n- Brown: 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 12, missing 4. So clearly, this approach isn't working. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered (Bb): Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n2. Plain (Cc): Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3\n3. Red (CR): Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2\n4. Brown (BB + Bb): Cases 6, 7, 8 \u2192 3\n\nAdding up: 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 12. Still missing 4. Where am I going wrong?\n\nAh, I see the issue now. In the previous analysis, I mistakenly included all 16 cases, but the correct assignments should be based on individual cases, not grouping them incorrectly. Let me list each case individually:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Red\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, classifying:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3\n- **Red (CR)**: Case 4 \u2192 1\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: Cases 5, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3\n- **Red (CR)**: Case 4 \u2192 1\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: Cases 5, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n\nThis adds up to 4 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 12. But there are 16 cases, so where are the remaining 4?\n\nAh! I realize now\u2014I miscounted. Let's do it correctly:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3\n- **Red (CR)**",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would include all combinations. Alternatively, perhaps the confusion arises because the F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on the F2 phenotype ratios. The main idea is to determine the phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes. The dominant alleles (C and B) will result in certain colors and pigmentation. So, the phenotypes depend on whether the parents' alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n- C_: dominant (red)\n- cc: recessive (plain)\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n- B_: dominant (brown)\n- bb: recessive (checkered)\n\nThe F2 generation will involve the combination of these two genes. Since both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 will all be CcBb, and the F2 will follow Mendelian ratios.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we'll consider the possible combinations of C and B traits. Each trait is determined independently, so we can use a Punnett square to calculate the probabilities.\n\nLet's construct the Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\n- Rows represent the alleles from the first parent (let's say it's CcBb)\n- Columns represent the alleles from the second parent (also CcBb)\n- Each cell represents the combination of alleles from a parent contributing one.\n\nSo, the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n        | C  | c \n--------|----|----\n      C  | CC | Cc \n--------|----|----\n      B  | CB | BB \n--------|----|----\n      b  | CB | bb \n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, the F2 square combines the alleles from both parents. Each parent contributes either C or c for gene C, and B or b for gene B. Since both parents are CcBb, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (if both parents contribute C)\n- Cc (if one parent contributes C and the other contributes c)\n- cc (if both parents contribute c)\n\nSimilarly for the B gene:\n\n- BB (both B)\n- Bb (one B and one b)\n- bb (none B)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the Punnett square will combine these possibilities. To get the phenotypes, we'll need to apply dominance rules:\n\n- For Pigmentation (C): C_ is dominant (red), cc is recessive (plain)\n- For Color (B): B_ is dominant (brown), bb is recessive (checkered)\n\nNow, let's determine the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered (Bb)**:\n   - Pigment: Checkered (since B is recessive)\n   - Color: Brown (since B is dominant)\n   - Genotype: Bb\n\n2. **Plain (cc)**:\n   - Pigment: Plain (since c is recessive)\n   - Color: Brown (since B is dominant, but the bird is plain)\n   - Genotype: cc\n\n3. **Red (Cc)**:\n   - Pigment: Red (since C is dominant)\n   - Color: Brown (since B is dominant, but the bird is red)\n   - Genotype: Cc\n\n4. **Brown (BB)**:\n   - Pigment: Brown (since B is dominant)\n   - Color: Brown (since B is dominant)\n   - Genotype: BB\n\nHowever, the description might be slightly different. Let me double-check the hierarchy of dominance. Typically, if there's another gene affecting pigment, it might override. But in this case, the presence of B (dominant) overrides the effect of C. So, regardless of whether C is present or not, if B is present, the bird will be brown. If B is absent, then C determines pigment, so C being present makes it red, and c makes it plain. \n\nTherefore, the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- **Checkered**: Only seen when both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b). So genotype: bb. Phenotype: Checkered (plain).\n- **Plain**: When B is recessive (b) but C is dominant (C). So genotype: Cb. Phenotype: Plain.\n- **Red**: When B is dominant (B) regardless of C. So genotype: C_, Phenotype: Red.\n- **Brown**: When B is dominant (B) and C is either dominant or recessive. So genotype: B_, Phenotype: Brown.\n\nWait, but according to the given options, some mention \"checkered\" and \"plain\" as separate categories. So perhaps the checkered refers to the absence of B (i.e., bb), while plain refers to the absence of C (i.e., Cb).\n\nIn any case, the key is to count how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category based on their genotypes.\n\nNow, constructing the Punnett square for F2:\n\nEach parent is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- For Gene C: CC, Cc, cc\n- For Gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nThe Punnett square will have cells representing each possible combination:\n\n- Top row: CC, Cc, cc\n- Left column: BB, Bb, bb\n- Each cell combines a C/B allele from the top row with a C/B allele from the left column.\n\nSo, the Punnett square cells will contain the combined alleles:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain (because bb)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red (as B is dominant, so brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Brown (B dominant)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain (because cc)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Let me re-express the Punnett square correctly. Each parent is CcBb, so their gametes will be CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, their gametes will produce CB and cb for each gene. So the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- From Cc x Cc: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- From Bb x Bb: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThese combine to create the F2 genotype ratios:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you cross two heterozygotes, the F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc for each gene. Combining them, the F2 will have the following genotype ratios:\n\nFor Gene C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor Gene B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThus, the overall F2 genotypes are a combination of these, leading to:\n\n- 1/16 CC BB (Checkered, plain)\n- 1/16 CC Bb (Checkered, brown)\n- 1/16 CC bb (Plain, brown)\n- 1/16 Cc BB (Red, brown)\n- 1/16 Cc Bb (Red, brown)\n- 1/16 Cc bb (Plain, brown)\n- 1/16 cc BB (Plain, brown)\n- 1/16 cc Bb (Checkered, brown)\n- 1/16 cc bb (Checkered, plain)\n\nWait, that seems off. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the F2 squares properly. The correct approach is to recognize that each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the segregation is CC : Cc : cc = 25%, 50%, 25%. Thus, for both genes, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each with equal probability of 1/16.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered (Bb)**: This occurs when both B is recessive (bb) and C is recessive (cc). Phenotype: Checkered (plain).\n2. **Plain (Cb)**: This occurs when B is dominant (B_) and C is recessive (cc). Phenotype: Plain.\n3. **Red (Cc)**: This occurs when B is dominant (B_) and C is dominant (CC). Phenotype: Red.\n4. **Brown (BB)**: This occurs when B is dominant (BB) or Bb. Phenotype: Brown.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Occurs in 1/16 of the population. So 1 out of 16.\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Occurs in 1/16. So 1 out of 16.\n- **Red (CR)**: Occurs in 1/16. So 1 out of 16.\n- **Brown (BB)**: Occurs in 1/4 of the population (since BB and Bb are 2/4 = 1/2). So 2 out of 16.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the above breakdown, each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n- **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n- **Red (CR)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16 \u2192 2\n\nAdding up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5. Hmm, that's inconsistent because the total should be 16. Wait, perhaps my earlier counting was wrong.\n\nWait, let's list each phenotype's count:\n\n1. **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n2. **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n3. **Red (CR)**: 1/16 \u2192 1\n4. **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16 \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5, which isn't adding up to 16. That suggests an error in the way I've counted. Let me try again.\n\nActually, each phenotype group is:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16\n- **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16\n- **Red (CR)**: 1/16\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16\n\nBut wait, this adds up to 5/16, which leaves 11/16 unaccounted for. That must mean I missed some groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misclassified the phenotypes. Let me reassess:\n\nPhenotype classification:\n\n1. **Checkered**: Only when both alleles are recessive for B and C. So genotype: bb (for B) and cc (for C). Phenotype: Checkered (plain).\n2. **Plain**: When B is recessive (bb) and C is dominant (CC or Cc). Phenotype: Plain.\n3. **Red**: When B is dominant (B_ but C is recessive (cc)). Phenotype: Red.\n4. **Brown**: When B is dominant (B_) regardless of C. Phenotype: Brown.\n\nSo, the counts per phenotype are:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16\n- **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16\n- **Red (CR)**: 1/16\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16\n\nThis totals 5/16, which still doesn't add up. I must have made a mistake here. Perhaps I should consider that the phenotypes also include the coat color beyond pigment, but according to the question, it's about pigmentation.

Phenotype: Brown.\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: 1/16\n- **Plain (Cc)**: 1/16\n- **Red (CR)**: 1/16\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: 2/16\n\nThis sums to 5/16, leaving 11/16 unaccounted. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Let's reconsider the F2 square.\n\nPerhaps I should approach it differently. Each gene segregates independently, so for Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. For Gene B: same. The F2 will have 16 possible combinations, each with equal frequency. Now, for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered (Bb)**: Occurs when B is recessive (bb) and C is recessive (cc). So, 1/16 of the population.\n2. **Plain (Cc)**: Occurs when B is recessive (bb) and C is dominant (CC or Cc). So, 1/16.\n3. **Red (CR)**: Occurs when B is dominant (B_) regardless of C. So, 2/16 (since both CC and Cc are red).\n4. **Brown (BB + Bb)**: Occurs when B is dominant (B_) regardless of C. Also 2/16.\n\nAdding these: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's wrong. Let me list all 16 possibilities:\n\nGenotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain (brown)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red (brown)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown (red)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain (brown)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (brown)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered (plain)\n\nNow, categorizing each:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4 cases\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3 cases\n- **Red (CR)**: Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2 cases\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: Cases 6, 7, 8 \u2192 3 cases\n\nWait, this gives:\n\n- Checkered: 4\n- Plain: 3\n- Red: 2\n- Brown: 3\n\nTotal: 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 12, missing 4. So clearly, this approach isn't working. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered (Bb): Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n2. Plain (Cc): Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3\n3. Red (CR): Cases 2, 5 \u2192 2\n4. Brown (BB + Bb): Cases 6, 7, 8 \u2192 3\n\nAdding up: 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 12. Still missing 4. Where am I going wrong?\n\nAh, I see the issue now. In the previous analysis, I mistakenly included all 16 cases, but the correct assignments should be based on individual cases, not grouping them incorrectly. Let me list each case individually:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Red\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, classifying:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3\n- **Red (CR)**: Case 4 \u2192 1\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: Cases 5, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3\n- **Red (CR)**: Case 4 \u2192 1\n- **Brown (BB + Bb)**: Cases 5, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n\nThis adds up to 4 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 12. But there are 16 cases, so where are the remaining 4?\n\nAh! I realize now\u2014I miscounted. Let's do it correctly:\n\n- **Checkered (Bb)**: Cases 3, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 4\n- **Plain (Cc)**: Cases 1, 4, 9 \u2192 3\n- **Red (CR)**",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering each gene separately: Gene C has two alleles, each contributing to the phenotype.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering each gene separately: Gene C has two alleles, each contributing to the phenotype. Similarly for gene B. However, since both genes are being considered together, the segregation follows the law of independent assortment.\n\nBut perhaps the user already did the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1, resulting in CcBB (checkered red?), CcBb (plain brown?), etc., but the actual letters don't matter as much as the phenotypes. Let's focus on the phenotypes. For gene C: dominant C \u2192 red; recessive c \u2192 plain. For gene B: dominant B \u2192 brown; recessive b \u2192 checkered. So each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown (C dominant, B present)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (since C is dominant, even if B is present)\nWait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc BB, the C is dominant, so it's still red, and B is dominant, so brown. So phenotype is Checkered brown.\nSimilarly,\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (since c is recessive, plain color; B is dominant, brown)\nWait, no. If the bird is cc BB, then the C is recessive (plain), regardless of B. But the B is dominant, so it's brown. So phenotype is Plain brown?\nWait, no. Wait, the bird's genotype is cc BB. So for gene C, the bird is plain (c is recessive). For gene B, the bird is brown (B is dominant). So overall phenotype is Checkered brown?\n\nNo, wait. The phenotype depends on both traits. So for each bird, we look at the dominant trait. If either trait is dominant, the bird shows that color. So for example, a bird with genotype Cc BB would express the dominant C (red) and dominant B (brown), so phenotype is Checkered red.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: The presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So for C, if there's at least one C, it's red. For B, if there's at least one B, it's brown. So a bird could be either red, brown, or both.\n\nSo for each bird, if C is present (any C), it's red. If B is present (any B), it's brown. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSo let's go through each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C present, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown (because B is present)\nWait, no. Because B is present (Bb has B), so the bird is brown. Even though it's bb for B, the presence of B makes it brown, so phenotype is Checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C present, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B present \u2192 Brown, but plain because C is recessive.\nWait, no: The bird's phenotype is determined by whether it expresses the dominant traits. So if the bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, it shows that color.\n\nSo for cc BB: \n- Gene C: c is recessive (plain)\n- Gene B: B is dominant (brown)\nSo overall phenotype: Checkered brown.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the bird's genotype is cc BB. So for gene C, the bird is plain (c recessive). For gene B, it's brown (B dominant). So the bird shows Checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly, for cc Bb:\n- Gene C: c recessive (plain)\n- Gene B: B dominant (brown)\nPhenotype: Checkered brown.\n\nFor cc bb:\n- Both genes are recessive\n- Phenotype: Plain red (since c is recessive for both)\n\nWait, but wait: The bird's phenotype depends on the combination of both genes. If either gene is dominant, the bird shows that color. So a bird with genotype cc bb would have both recessive alleles, showing plain red.\n\nNow, let's count how many birds fall into each category.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (1/4 of F2)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (1/4)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red (1/4)\n\nWait, no. That's not accurate. Let's consider independent assortment. For each gene, there's a 50% chance for each allele. So for gene C, half the F2 will be C and half bb. Same for gene B. So the Punnett square for F2 would have four combinations: CC, Cc, cc for each gene. Thus, the F2 population consists of four possible genotypic classes, each represented by a quarter of the total. But their phenotypes depend on whether they have dominant alleles.\n\nSo let's categorize them:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- CC bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 3)\n- Cc BB: Checkered red (phenotype 4)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 5)\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 6)\n- cc BB: Checkered brown (phenotype 7)\n- cc Bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 8)\n- cc bb: Plain red (phenotype 9)\n\nEach of these occurs with a probability of 1/9? Wait, no. Let me think again. Since each gene segregates independently, the F2 will have a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene, but combined. So for each gene, the probability is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nThus, the combined probabilities are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene. For example, the probability of having CC for gene C and BB for gene B is 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSo let's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (phenotype 1): Occurs when either gene C is dominant (C) or gene B is dominant (B). Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n   - P(CC) = 25%, P(BB) = 25%, and P(C \u222a B) = P(C) + P(B) - P(C \u2229 B) = 75% + 75% - 50% = 100% - 50% = 50%. Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't right because dominance doesn't add up like that. Instead, we should compute the number of birds with at least one dominant allele.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird can be categorized based on their genotypes, perhaps it's easier to note that the only time a bird does NOT have any dominant alleles is when it's cc bb. All other cases have at least one dominant allele.\n\nSo in F2:\n- Total birds: 16 (assuming diploid, so 2^4=16)\n- Birds without any dominant alleles (only cc bb): 1 bird\n- Therefore, birds with at least one dominant allele: 15 birds\n\nNow, among these 15:\n- How many are Checkered red? Those where either C is present or B is present (but not necessarily both). So:\n  - C is present: Cc and CC\n    - Cc: 50% of F2 \u2192 8 birds\n    - CC: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n  - B is present: Cc and BB\n    - Cc: 8 birds\n    - BB: 4 birds\n  But wait, some birds are counted twice. Specifically, those with both C and B (CcBb) are included in both categories. So to avoid double-counting, we use inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal Checkered red = (Number with C) + (Number with B) - (Number with both C and B)\n- Number with C: 8 (CC and Cc)\n- Number with B: 8 (CC and Cc)\n- Number with both C and B: 4 (CcBb)\nSo Total Checkered red = 8 + 8 - 4 = 12\n\nCheckered brown: Remaining birds = 15 - 12 = 3\n\nPlain red: Only the bird with cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution in F2 is:\n- Checkered red: 12\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 1\n\nAdding these up: 12 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the total number of F2 birds.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Close but differs by one.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems off.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also wrong.\n\nF. Checkered red 4, Checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nG. Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No, we have 12 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 0 plain brown.\n\nH. Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. Checkered red 7, Checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nK. Checkered red 11, Checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nL. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nM. Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nN. Checkered red 13, Checkered brown 1, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nO. Checkered red 4, Checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nP. Checkered red 10, Checkered brown 4, plain red 2, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nQ. Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nR. Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Yes! Our calculation was Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 0. But none of the options exactly match except option G says 12,2,2,0, which is close but not exact. Wait, my earlier conclusion said Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 0, but the options don't have this. Looking back, the options are A to L. Option H is Checkered red 5, brown 3, plain red 2, brown 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic counts. Let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 birds: 16\n\nOnly one bird is cc bb (plain red).\n\nAll others (15) have at least one dominant allele.\n\nAmong these 15:\n- Number with C (dominant): Cc and CC \u2192 8 birds\n- Number with B (dominant): Cc and BB \u2192 8 birds\n- Number with both C and B: CcBb \u2192 4 birds\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n- Total with C or B = 8 + 8 - 4 = 12\n- So, Checkered red: 12\n- Checkered brown: 15 - 12 = 3\n- Plain red: 1 (cc bb)\n- Plain brown: 0 (no birds are plain brown)\n\nSo the distribution is 12 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 plain red, 0 plain brown. None of the answer choices directly reflect this. However, looking at the options, option G is Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Which is different from what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 calculation is slightly different. Let me reevaluate the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,3,5,6,7,8 \u2192 6 birds\n- Plain red: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain brown: None, since all have dominant B\n\nSo according to this, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 2 : 6 : 1 : 0, which simplifies to 2:6:1:0.\n\nBut looking at the options, option H is Checkered red 5, brown 3, plain red 2, brown 6 \u2192 which sums to 16, but the numbers don't align with our calculation.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the F2 genotype ratios are different due to independent assortment. Perhaps the F2 genotype ratio is 1:2:1 for each gene, leading to 9 possible genotypic combinations, each equally likely. But in reality, for each gene, there's a 50% chance of each allele. So the combined F2 would have 16 possible genotypes, with certain frequencies.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their frequencies:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,4 \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,3,5,6,7,8 \u2192 6 cases \u2192 6/16 = 3/8\n- Plain red: Case 9 \u2192 1/16\n- Plain brown: None, as all have at least one dominant allele\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. So according to this breakdown, the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 2:3:1:0.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H is Checkered red 5, brown 3, plain red 2, brown 6 \u2192 which sums to 16 and reflects the 5:3:2:6 ratio, which doesn't match our new calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Hmm, but according to the calculations above, it's 2:3:1:0. So none of the options match perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misapplied the F2 genotype frequencies. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 genotype frequencies are:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nGene B: same as above.\n\nCombined F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nBut since each bird is diploid, the frequency of each phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele. So:\n\n- Checkered red (at least one dominant allele):\n  - CC BB: 6.25%\n  - CC B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering each gene separately: Gene C has two alleles, each contributing to the phenotype. Similarly for gene B. However, since both genes are being considered together, the segregation follows the law of independent assortment.\n\nBut perhaps the user already did the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1, resulting in CcBB (checkered red?), CcBb (plain brown?), etc., but the actual letters don't matter as much as the phenotypes. Let's focus on the phenotypes. For gene C: dominant C \u2192 red; recessive c \u2192 plain. For gene B: dominant B \u2192 brown; recessive b \u2192 checkered. So each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then determine their phenotypes.\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown (C dominant, B present)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (since C is dominant, even if B is present)\nWait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc BB, the C is dominant, so it's still red, and B is dominant, so brown. So phenotype is Checkered brown.\nSimilarly,\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (since c is recessive, plain color; B is dominant, brown)\nWait, no. If the bird is cc BB, then the C is recessive (plain), regardless of B. But the B is dominant, so it's brown. So phenotype is Plain brown?\nWait, no. Wait, the bird's genotype is cc BB. So for gene C, the bird is plain (c is recessive). For gene B, the bird is brown (B is dominant). So overall phenotype is Checkered brown?\n\nNo, wait. The phenotype depends on both traits. So for each bird, we look at the dominant trait. If either trait is dominant, the bird shows that color. So for example, a bird with genotype Cc BB would express the dominant C (red) and dominant B (brown), so phenotype is Checkered red.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: The presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So for C, if there's at least one C, it's red. For B, if there's at least one B, it's brown. So a bird could be either red, brown, or both.\n\nSo for each bird, if C is present (any C), it's red. If B is present (any B), it's brown. Otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSo let's go through each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C present, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown (because B is present)\nWait, no. Because B is present (Bb has B), so the bird is brown. Even though it's bb for B, the presence of B makes it brown, so phenotype is Checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C present, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B present \u2192 Brown, but plain because C is recessive.\nWait, no: The bird's phenotype is determined by whether it expresses the dominant traits. So if the bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, it shows that color.\n\nSo for cc BB: \n- Gene C: c is recessive (plain)\n- Gene B: B is dominant (brown)\nSo overall phenotype: Checkered brown.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the bird's genotype is cc BB. So for gene C, the bird is plain (c recessive). For gene B, it's brown (B dominant). So the bird shows Checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly, for cc Bb:\n- Gene C: c recessive (plain)\n- Gene B: B dominant (brown)\nPhenotype: Checkered brown.\n\nFor cc bb:\n- Both genes are recessive\n- Phenotype: Plain red (since c is recessive for both)\n\nWait, but wait: The bird's phenotype depends on the combination of both genes. If either gene is dominant, the bird shows that color. So a bird with genotype cc bb would have both recessive alleles, showing plain red.\n\nNow, let's count how many birds fall into each category.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (1/4 of F2)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (1/4)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown (1/4)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red (1/4)\n\nWait, no. That's not accurate. Let's consider independent assortment. For each gene, there's a 50% chance for each allele. So for gene C, half the F2 will be C and half bb. Same for gene B. So the Punnett square for F2 would have four combinations: CC, Cc, cc for each gene. Thus, the F2 population consists of four possible genotypic classes, each represented by a quarter of the total. But their phenotypes depend on whether they have dominant alleles.\n\nSo let's categorize them:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- CC bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 3)\n- Cc BB: Checkered red (phenotype 4)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 5)\n- Cc bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 6)\n- cc BB: Checkered brown (phenotype 7)\n- cc Bb: Checkered brown (phenotype 8)\n- cc bb: Plain red (phenotype 9)\n\nEach of these occurs with a probability of 1/9? Wait, no. Let me think again. Since each gene segregates independently, the F2 will have a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene, but combined. So for each gene, the probability is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nThus, the combined probabilities are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene. For example, the probability of having CC for gene C and BB for gene B is 25% * 25% = 6.25%.\n\nSo let's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (phenotype 1): Occurs when either gene C is dominant (C) or gene B is dominant (B). Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n   - P(CC) = 25%, P(BB) = 25%, and P(C \u222a B) = P(C) + P(B) - P(C \u2229 B) = 75% + 75% - 50% = 100% - 50% = 50%. Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't right because dominance doesn't add up like that. Instead, we should compute the number of birds with at least one dominant allele.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird can be categorized based on their genotypes, perhaps it's easier to note that the only time a bird does NOT have any dominant alleles is when it's cc bb. All other cases have at least one dominant allele.\n\nSo in F2:\n- Total birds: 16 (assuming diploid, so 2^4=16)\n- Birds without any dominant alleles (only cc bb): 1 bird\n- Therefore, birds with at least one dominant allele: 15 birds\n\nNow, among these 15:\n- How many are Checkered red? Those where either C is present or B is present (but not necessarily both). So:\n  - C is present: Cc and CC\n    - Cc: 50% of F2 \u2192 8 birds\n    - CC: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n  - B is present: Cc and BB\n    - Cc: 8 birds\n    - BB: 4 birds\n  But wait, some birds are counted twice. Specifically, those with both C and B (CcBb) are included in both categories. So to avoid double-counting, we use inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal Checkered red = (Number with C) + (Number with B) - (Number with both C and B)\n- Number with C: 8 (CC and Cc)\n- Number with B: 8 (CC and Cc)\n- Number with both C and B: 4 (CcBb)\nSo Total Checkered red = 8 + 8 - 4 = 12\n\nCheckered brown: Remaining birds = 15 - 12 = 3\n\nPlain red: Only the bird with cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution in F2 is:\n- Checkered red: 12\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 1\n\nAdding these up: 12 + 3 + 1 = 16, which matches the total number of F2 birds.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Also doesn't match.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Close but differs by one.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems off.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also wrong.\n\nF. Checkered red 4, Checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nG. Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No, we have 12 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 0 plain brown.\n\nH. Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. Checkered red 7, Checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nK. Checkered red 11, Checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nL. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nM. Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nN. Checkered red 13, Checkered brown 1, plain red 2, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nO. Checkered red 4, Checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nP. Checkered red 10, Checkered brown 4, plain red 2, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nQ. Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nR. Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Yes! Our calculation was Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 0. But none of the options exactly match except option G says 12,2,2,0, which is close but not exact. Wait, my earlier conclusion said Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 0, but the options don't have this. Looking back, the options are A to L. Option H is Checkered red 5, brown 3, plain red 2, brown 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic counts. Let me recount:\n\nTotal F2 birds: 16\n\nOnly one bird is cc bb (plain red).\n\nAll others (15) have at least one dominant allele.\n\nAmong these 15:\n- Number with C (dominant): Cc and CC \u2192 8 birds\n- Number with B (dominant): Cc and BB \u2192 8 birds\n- Number with both C and B: CcBb \u2192 4 birds\n\nUsing inclusion-exclusion:\n- Total with C or B = 8 + 8 - 4 = 12\n- So, Checkered red: 12\n- Checkered brown: 15 - 12 = 3\n- Plain red: 1 (cc bb)\n- Plain brown: 0 (no birds are plain brown)\n\nSo the distribution is 12 Checkered red, 3 Checkered brown, 1 plain red, 0 plain brown. None of the answer choices directly reflect this. However, looking at the options, option G is Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Which is different from what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 calculation is slightly different. Let me reevaluate the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 2 birds\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,3,5,6,7,8 \u2192 6 birds\n- Plain red: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain brown: None, since all have dominant B\n\nSo according to this, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 2 : 6 : 1 : 0, which simplifies to 2:6:1:0.\n\nBut looking at the options, option H is Checkered red 5, brown 3, plain red 2, brown 6 \u2192 which sums to 16, but the numbers don't align with our calculation.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the F2 genotype ratios are different due to independent assortment. Perhaps the F2 genotype ratio is 1:2:1 for each gene, leading to 9 possible genotypic combinations, each equally likely. But in reality, for each gene, there's a 50% chance of each allele. So the combined F2 would have 16 possible genotypes, with certain frequencies.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their frequencies:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,4 \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,3,5,6,7,8 \u2192 6 cases \u2192 6/16 = 3/8\n- Plain red: Case 9 \u2192 1/16\n- Plain brown: None, as all have at least one dominant allele\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. So according to this breakdown, the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 2:3:1:0.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H is Checkered red 5, brown 3, plain red 2, brown 6 \u2192 which sums to 16 and reflects the 5:3:2:6 ratio, which doesn't match our new calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Hmm, but according to the calculations above, it's 2:3:1:0. So none of the options match perfectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misapplied the F2 genotype frequencies. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 genotype frequencies are:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nGene B: same as above.\n\nCombined F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nBut since each bird is diploid, the frequency of each phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele. So:\n\n- Checkered red (at least one dominant allele):\n  - CC BB: 6.25%\n  - CC B",

    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering the independent assortment, each pair of genes segregates independently.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering the independent assortment, each pair of genes segregates independently. However, since both parents are homozygous for each gene, there won't be any recombination during meiosis. So each gene segregates independently. Let me structure the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 gametes: CB, CB, CB, CB?\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say each parent contributes one allele per gene. For gene C: Parent 1 has CC \u2192 always contributes C. Parent 2 has cc \u2192 always contributes c. Similarly for gene B: Parent 1 has BB \u2192 always contributes B. Parent 2 has bb \u2192 always contributes b. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) can only produce gametes CB and cb. Thus, F1 selfing leads to F2 where each gene segregates independently. So:\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1: C\n- Parent 2: c\nSo F2 will have C and c in equal frequency.\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1: B\n- Parent 2: b\nSimilarly, F2 will have B and b in equal frequency.\n\nSince the genes assort independently, the possible F2 genotypes are combinations of these alleles. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (all dominant)\n- CC Bb (dominant C, recessive B)\n- CC bb (dominant C, recessive b)\n- cc BB (recessive c, dominant B)\n- cc Bb (recessive c, recessive b)\n- cc bb (recessive c, dominant b)\n\nNow, looking at the phenotypes. Pigmentation is determined by gene B: dominant B = brown, recessive b = checkered. Pigment presence is also influenced by gene C: dominant C = red, recessive c = plain. However, since coat color and pigment production might be linked, but the problem states that pigment color is determined by gene B and coat color by gene C. So coat color is determined by gene C, and pigment production by gene B. Therefore, the phenotype depends on both genes. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" That suggests that the checkered pattern is due to gene C, regardless of pigment. So the phenotype is determined by both genes: if the bird is checkered (gene C recessive), then regardless of pigment, it's checkered. If it's not checkered (gene C dominant), then the pigment color is determined by gene B: brown if B dominant, plain if b dominant.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and brown: when gene C is recessive (cc) and gene B is dominant (Bb or BB)\n- Checkered and plain: when gene C is recessive (cc) and gene B is recessive (bb)\n- Plain and brown: when gene C is dominant (CC or Cc) and gene B is dominant (Bb or BB)\n- Plain and plain: when gene C is dominant (CC or Cc) and gene B is recessive (bb)\n\nBut wait, the question asks for phenotypic ratio in the F2. So let's calculate how many individuals fall into each category in the F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n1. CC BB (C dominant, B dominant): Brown and red.\n2. CC Bb (C dominant, b recessive): Brown and plain.\n3.

Checkered and Plain: Only cc BB is brown, others are checkered. Wait, no\u2014cc BB has B dominant, so it's brown. cc Bb has b recessive, so it's plain. cc bb has b dominant, so it's checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's mixed up. Let's think again:\n\nWait, no. The phenotype is determined by both genes. For a bird to be checkered and brown, it must be cc (for C recessive) and B dominant (so brown). For checkered and plain, it must be cc (C recessive) and B recessive (so plain). For plain and brown, it must be CC or Cc (C dominant) and B dominant. For plain and checkered, it must be CC or Cc (C dominant) and B recessive.\n\nSo the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 12\n- Checkered and Plain: cc BB (but B dominant \u2192 brown) \u2013 no, wait, no. Wait, cc BB is brown, so it's checkered and brown. So:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 3 cases (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB \u2192 because cc Bb is checkered and brown, and cc bb is checkered and checkered.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, the presence of B dominant makes the bird brown, while B recessive makes it plain. So:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 12\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB is brown, but wait, no. cc BB is brown, so it fits checkered and brown. What about cc Bb? It's checkered and brown. And cc bb is checkered and checkered. So:\n\nWait, the confusion arises because some of the checkered phenotypes may have different traits depending on B. But according to the problem statement, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. So, the checkered phenotype (regardless of B) would include all checkered birds, whether they are brown or plain.\n\nBut in terms of the phenotypic categories given in the options, each option lists checkered/brown, checkered/plain, etc. So, perhaps the way to approach is to count how many have each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each phenotype by counting the genotypes leading to that phenotype.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered and Brown | cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb | ?\nCheckered and Plain | cc BB | ?\nPlain and Brown | CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb | ?\nPlain and Checkered | CC, Cc | ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to use the formula for each phenotype.\n\nTotal F2: 16.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: requires cc (C recessive) AND B dominant (B present). So the genotype is cc BB (B present) OR cc Bb (B present). Wait, no\u2014because B present is either B or Bb. So the phenotype is brown for any bird with B present. So the genotype for Checkered and Brown is cc BB, cc Bb, or cc bb? No, wait. Because:\n\n- For Checkered and Brown: must be cc (C recessive) AND B dominant (at least one B allele).\n- So the genotype could be cc BB, cc Bb, or cc bb? Wait, no: because cc bb would have B recessive, so it's Checkered and Checkered.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nIf a bird is Checkered (cc) and has at least one B allele (B present), then it's Brown. If it's Checkered and has no B alleles (bb), it's Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, if a bird is Plain (CC or Cc) and has at least one B allele, it's Brown. If it's Plain and has no B alleles (bb), it's Plain.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc (C recessive) AND (B present). So possible genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb? Wait, no. Because cc bb would still be Checkered, regardless of B. Wait, no: B presence determines Brown or Checkered. So:\n\n- For Checkered and Brown: cc (C recessive) AND B present (either B or Bb)\n- For Checkered and Plain: cc (C recessive) AND B absent (bb)\n- For Plain and Brown: CC (C dominant) OR Cc (C dominant) AND B present (either B or Bb)\n- For Plain and Checkered: CC (C dominant) AND B absent (bb) OR Cc (C dominant) AND B absent (bb)\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me instead list all possible combinations:\n\nTotal F2 genotypes: 16.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 genotypes\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB (since cc Bb is Checkered and Brown, and cc bb is Checkered and Checkered)\n- Plain and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 6 genotypes\n- Plain and Checkered: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n\nWait, no\u2014CC bb is CC (C dominant) and bb (B recessive), so it's Plain and Checkered.\n\nCC BB: CC (C dominant) and BB (B dominant), so it's Plain and Brown.\n\nSame for CC Bb, CC bb, etc.\n\nSo now, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 3 genotypes \u2192 3/16\n- Checkered and Plain: 1 genotype \u2192 1/16\n- Plain and Brown: 6 genotypes \u2192 6/16\n- Plain and Checkered: 2 genotypes \u2192 2/16\n\nWait, but checking the sum: 3+1+6+2=12. Hmm, discrepancy. Maybe my grouping is off.\n\nAlternative approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles.\n\n- For Checkered and Brown: both parents are cc. They can produce cc gametes. Their B alleles determine Brown (any B present) or Checkered (only b). So in F2:\n\n  - From cc (C recessive) and BB (B dominant): BB is brown.\n  - From cc and Bb: Bb is brown.\n  - From cc and bb: bb is checkered.\n  \nThus, the genotypes leading to Checkered and Brown are: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 total 3.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB \u2192 because anything else (Bb, bb) would be brown.\n\nWait, no. If a bird is Checkered (cc) and has at least one B allele, it's Brown. If it's Checkered and has no B alleles, it's Checkered. So:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB \u2192 1\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. Then:\n\n- Plain and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 6\n\n- Plain and Checkered: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n\nAdding up: 3 + 1 + 6 + 2 = 12. So the remaining 4 would be something else? Wait, no\u2014because 16 - 12 = 4. Where do those come from?\n\nAh, I see! The 4 remaining would be the birds that are both Checkered and Checkered (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb) but without any B alleles? Wait, no. Wait, no, all the 12 accounted for are:\n\n- 3 Checkered and Brown\n- 1 Checkered and Plain\n- 6 Plain and Brown\n- 2 Plain and Checkered\n\nWhich sums to 3+1+6+2=12, leaving 4 birds unaccounted for. Those would be the cases where both C and B are recessive (cc bb). But in our initial breakdown, cc bb was classified as Checkered and Checkered, not Plain. Wait, perhaps I missed that.\n\nLooking back: In the F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: 3\n2. Checkered and Plain: 1\n3. Plain and Brown: 6\n4. Plain and Checkered: 2\n5. Checkered and Checkered: 1 (cc bb)\n\nBut wait, the previous calculation said 12 accounted for, including Checkered and Brown, Checkered and Plain, etc., plus Checkered and Checkered. So the missing 4 would be the 1 bird (cc bb) who is Checkered and Checkered.\n\nBut in the answer choices, none mention Checkered and Checkered. Instead, the options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, so the actual counts are:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 3\n- Checkered and Plain: 1\n- Plain and Brown: 6\n- Checkered and Checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options include this last category. The closest is option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nOption G includes Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, etc., which doesn't match our 3 Checkered and Brown.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's recount:\n\nIn F2:\n\n- The number of Checkered and Brown is 3 (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n- Checkered and Plain: 1 (only cc BB)\n- Plain and Brown: 6 (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- Checkered and Checkered: 1 (cc bb)\n\nBut 3+1+6+1=11, leaving 5 unaccounted for. Wait, that doesn't add up. Total should be 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me think differently. Each of the 16 birds can be represented as a 2x2 grid for each gene.\n\nGene C: C (C) or c (c)\n\nGene B: B (B) or b (b)\n\nSo, possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. cc BB\n5. cc Bb\n6. cc bb\n7. Cc BB\n8. Cc Bb\n9. Cc bb\n10. cc Cc (Wait, no\u2014C is dominant, so cc is recessive. Wait, correction: all are either CC, Cc, or cc.)\n\nWait, no, each bird is either CC, Cc, or cc for C.\n\nSimilarly for B: BB, Bb, or bb.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 4 possible for C (CC, Cc, cc)\n- 3 possible for B (BB, Bb, bb)\nTotal combinations: 4*3=12. But wait, we're considering F2, so 16 birds. Hmm, perhaps the question assumes that the parents are heterozygous and selfing once, resulting in 16 birds, but perhaps the options are simplified.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the parents are each producing two gametes, resulting in four possible combinations, but since it's selfing, each gamete combines with itself, giving 16 possible outcomes. But I think I've already considered that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options assume that all possible",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering the independent assortment, each pair of genes segregates independently. However, since both parents are homozygous for each gene, there won't be any recombination during meiosis. So each gene segregates independently. Let me structure the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 gametes: CB, CB, CB, CB?\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say each parent contributes one allele per gene. For gene C: Parent 1 has CC \u2192 always contributes C. Parent 2 has cc \u2192 always contributes c. Similarly for gene B: Parent 1 has BB \u2192 always contributes B. Parent 2 has bb \u2192 always contributes b. Therefore, F1 (CcBb) can only produce gametes CB and cb. Thus, F1 selfing leads to F2 where each gene segregates independently. So:\n\nFor gene C:\n- Parent 1: C\n- Parent 2: c\nSo F2 will have C and c in equal frequency.\n\nFor gene B:\n- Parent 1: B\n- Parent 2: b\nSimilarly, F2 will have B and b in equal frequency.\n\nSince the genes assort independently, the possible F2 genotypes are combinations of these alleles. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (all dominant)\n- CC Bb (dominant C, recessive B)\n- CC bb (dominant C, recessive b)\n- cc BB (recessive c, dominant B)\n- cc Bb (recessive c, recessive b)\n- cc bb (recessive c, dominant b)\n\nNow, looking at the phenotypes. Pigmentation is determined by gene B: dominant B = brown, recessive b = checkered. Pigment presence is also influenced by gene C: dominant C = red, recessive c = plain. However, since coat color and pigment production might be linked, but the problem states that pigment color is determined by gene B and coat color by gene C. So coat color is determined by gene C, and pigment production by gene B. Therefore, the phenotype depends on both genes. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" That suggests that the checkered pattern is due to gene C, regardless of pigment. So the phenotype is determined by both genes: if the bird is checkered (gene C recessive), then regardless of pigment, it's checkered. If it's not checkered (gene C dominant), then the pigment color is determined by gene B: brown if B dominant, plain if b dominant.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered and brown: when gene C is recessive (cc) and gene B is dominant (Bb or BB)\n- Checkered and plain: when gene C is recessive (cc) and gene B is recessive (bb)\n- Plain and brown: when gene C is dominant (CC or Cc) and gene B is dominant (Bb or BB)\n- Plain and plain: when gene C is dominant (CC or Cc) and gene B is recessive (bb)\n\nBut wait, the question asks for phenotypic ratio in the F2. So let's calculate how many individuals fall into each category in the F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n1. CC BB (C dominant, B dominant): Brown and red.\n2. CC Bb (C dominant, b recessive): Brown and plain.\n3. CC bb (C dominant, b dominant): Brown and checkered.\n4. cc BB (c recessive, B dominant): Plain and brown.\n5. cc Bb (c recessive, b recessive): Plain and plain.\n6. cc bb (c recessive, b dominant): Plain and checkered.\n\nNow, assigning phenotypes:\n\n- Any bird with C recessive (cc) will be checkered, regardless of B. So:\n\n- cc BB: Checkered, Brown\n- cc Bb: Checkered, Plain\n- cc bb: Checkered, Checkered\n\nAnd birds with C dominant (CC or Cc):\n\n- CC BB/Bb: Red, Brown\n- CC bb: Red, Checkered\n- Cc BB/Bb: Plain, Brown\n- Cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nAssuming F2 population consists of 16 individuals (since each gene has 2 alleles, and independent assortment, 4 x 4=16).\n\nEach combination of alleles occurs in proportion to the product of the probabilities of each allele being passed on. Since each gene segregates independently, the probability for each genotype is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 for each specific combination.\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 * 16 = 4\n- CC Bb: 1/4 * 16 = 4\n- CC bb: 1/4 * 16 = 4\n- cc BB: 1/4 * 16 = 4\n- cc Bb: 1/4 * 16 = 4\n- cc bb: 1/4 * 16 = 4\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\nCheckered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 4 + 4 + 4 = 12\nCheckered and Plain: cc BB (wait, no\u2014if cc BB has B dominant, it's brown, so actually:\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- cc BB: Checkered, Brown\n- cc Bb: Checkered, Plain\n- cc bb: Checkered, Checkered\n\nSo all three checkered phenotypes.\n\nCheckered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 12\n\nPlain and Brown: CC BB/Bb, CC bb \u2192 4 + 4 = 8\n\nPlain and Checkered: CC BB/Bb, cc BB (no, wait, cc BB is already covered under checkered and brown). Wait, let's recalculate:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 12\n2. Checkered and Plain: Only cc BB is brown, others are checkered. Wait, no\u2014cc BB has B dominant, so it's brown. cc Bb has b recessive, so it's plain. cc bb has b dominant, so it's checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's mixed up. Let's think again:\n\nWait, no. The phenotype is determined by both genes. For a bird to be checkered and brown, it must be cc (for C recessive) and B dominant (so brown). For checkered and plain, it must be cc (C recessive) and B recessive (so plain). For plain and brown, it must be CC or Cc (C dominant) and B dominant. For plain and checkered, it must be CC or Cc (C dominant) and B recessive.\n\nSo the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 12\n- Checkered and Plain: cc BB (but B dominant \u2192 brown) \u2013 no, wait, no. Wait, cc BB is brown, so it's checkered and brown. So:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 3 cases (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB \u2192 because cc Bb is checkered and brown, and cc bb is checkered and checkered.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, the presence of B dominant makes the bird brown, while B recessive makes it plain. So:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 12\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB is brown, but wait, no. cc BB is brown, so it fits checkered and brown. What about cc Bb? It's checkered and brown. And cc bb is checkered and checkered. So:\n\nWait, the confusion arises because some of the checkered phenotypes may have different traits depending on B. But according to the problem statement, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. So, the checkered phenotype (regardless of B) would include all checkered birds, whether they are brown or plain.\n\nBut in terms of the phenotypic categories given in the options, each option lists checkered/brown, checkered/plain, etc. So, perhaps the way to approach is to count how many have each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each phenotype by counting the genotypes leading to that phenotype.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered and Brown | cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb | ?\nCheckered and Plain | cc BB | ?\nPlain and Brown | CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb | ?\nPlain and Checkered | CC, Cc | ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to use the formula for each phenotype.\n\nTotal F2: 16.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: requires cc (C recessive) AND B dominant (B present). So the genotype is cc BB (B present) OR cc Bb (B present). Wait, no\u2014because B present is either B or Bb. So the phenotype is brown for any bird with B present. So the genotype for Checkered and Brown is cc BB, cc Bb, or cc bb? No, wait. Because:\n\n- For Checkered and Brown: must be cc (C recessive) AND B dominant (at least one B allele).\n- So the genotype could be cc BB, cc Bb, or cc bb? Wait, no: because cc bb would have B recessive, so it's Checkered and Checkered.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nIf a bird is Checkered (cc) and has at least one B allele (B present), then it's Brown.

If it's Plain and has no B alleles (bb), it's Plain.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc (C recessive) AND (B present). So possible genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb? Wait, no. Because cc bb would still be Checkered, regardless of B. Wait, no: B presence determines Brown or Checkered. So:\n\n- For Checkered and Brown: cc (C recessive) AND B present (either B or Bb)\n- For Checkered and Plain: cc (C recessive) AND B absent (bb)\n- For Plain and Brown: CC (C dominant) OR Cc (C dominant) AND B present (either B or Bb)\n- For Plain and Checkered: CC (C dominant) AND B absent (bb) OR Cc (C dominant) AND B absent (bb)\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me instead list all possible combinations:\n\nTotal F2 genotypes: 16.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 genotypes\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB (since cc Bb is Checkered and Brown, and cc bb is Checkered and Checkered)\n- Plain and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 6 genotypes\n- Plain and Checkered: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 genotypes\n\nWait, no\u2014CC bb is CC (C dominant) and bb (B recessive), so it's Plain and Checkered.\n\nCC BB: CC (C dominant) and BB (B dominant), so it's Plain and Brown.\n\nSame for CC Bb, CC bb, etc.\n\nSo now, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 3 genotypes \u2192 3/16\n- Checkered and Plain: 1 genotype \u2192 1/16\n- Plain and Brown: 6 genotypes \u2192 6/16\n- Plain and Checkered: 2 genotypes \u2192 2/16\n\nWait, but checking the sum: 3+1+6+2=12. Hmm, discrepancy. Maybe my grouping is off.\n\nAlternative approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their alleles.\n\n- For Checkered and Brown: both parents are cc. They can produce cc gametes. Their B alleles determine Brown (any B present) or Checkered (only b). So in F2:\n\n  - From cc (C recessive) and BB (B dominant): BB is brown.\n  - From cc and Bb: Bb is brown.\n  - From cc and bb: bb is checkered.\n  \nThus, the genotypes leading to Checkered and Brown are: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 total 3.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB \u2192 because anything else (Bb, bb) would be brown.\n\nWait, no. If a bird is Checkered (cc) and has at least one B allele, it's Brown. If it's Checkered and has no B alleles, it's Checkered. So:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3\n- Checkered and Plain: only cc BB \u2192 1\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. Then:\n\n- Plain and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 6\n\n- Plain and Checkered: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n\nAdding up: 3 + 1 + 6 + 2 = 12. So the remaining 4 would be something else? Wait, no\u2014because 16 - 12 = 4. Where do those come from?\n\nAh, I see! The 4 remaining would be the birds that are both Checkered and Checkered (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb) but without any B alleles? Wait, no. Wait, no, all the 12 accounted for are:\n\n- 3 Checkered and Brown\n- 1 Checkered and Plain\n- 6 Plain and Brown\n- 2 Plain and Checkered\n\nWhich sums to 3+1+6+2=12, leaving 4 birds unaccounted for. Those would be the cases where both C and B are recessive (cc bb). But in our initial breakdown, cc bb was classified as Checkered and Checkered, not Plain. Wait, perhaps I missed that.\n\nLooking back: In the F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown: 3\n2. Checkered and Plain: 1\n3. Plain and Brown: 6\n4. Plain and Checkered: 2\n5. Checkered and Checkered: 1 (cc bb)\n\nBut wait, the previous calculation said 12 accounted for, including Checkered and Brown, Checkered and Plain, etc., plus Checkered and Checkered. So the missing 4 would be the 1 bird (cc bb) who is Checkered and Checkered.\n\nBut in the answer choices, none mention Checkered and Checkered. Instead, the options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, so the actual counts are:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 3\n- Checkered and Plain: 1\n- Plain and Brown: 6\n- Checkered and Checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options include this last category. The closest is option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\n\nOption G includes Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, etc., which doesn't match our 3 Checkered and Brown.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let's recount:\n\nIn F2:\n\n- The number of Checkered and Brown is 3 (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb)\n- Checkered and Plain: 1 (only cc BB)\n- Plain and Brown: 6 (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- Checkered and Checkered: 1 (cc bb)\n\nBut 3+1+6+1=11, leaving 5 unaccounted for. Wait, that doesn't add up. Total should be 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me think differently. Each of the 16 birds can be represented as a 2x2 grid for each gene.\n\nGene C: C (C) or c (c)\n\nGene B: B (B) or b (b)\n\nSo, possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. cc BB\n5. cc Bb\n6. cc bb\n7. Cc BB\n8. Cc Bb\n9. Cc bb\n10. cc Cc (Wait, no\u2014C is dominant, so cc is recessive. Wait, correction: all are either CC, Cc, or cc.)\n\nWait, no, each bird is either CC, Cc, or cc for C.\n\nSimilarly for B: BB, Bb, or bb.\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 4 possible for C (CC, Cc, cc)\n- 3 possible for B (BB, Bb, bb)\nTotal combinations: 4*3=12. But wait, we're considering F2, so 16 birds. Hmm, perhaps the question assumes that the parents are heterozygous and selfing once, resulting in 16 birds, but perhaps the options are simplified.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the parents are each producing two gametes, resulting in four possible combinations, but since it's selfing, each gamete combines with itself, giving 16 possible outcomes. But I think I've already considered that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options assume that all possible",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the possible F2 genotypes are:",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% (CB + CB) = CC BB\n- 25% (CB + cb) = Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb + CB) = Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb + cb) = cc bb\n\nBut looking back at the options given, some mention different F2 ratios. However, the question asks specifically about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To determine the phenotype, we look at both genes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the combination of C/c and B/b alleles. The dominant alleles are expressed, so if either C or B is present, the bird is colored or has the appropriate pigmentation.\n\nSo, let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether both C and B are present (i.e., C B), or any one of them is present (either C or B).\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid scenario. Each bird's genotype can be represented as a combination of C/B and c/b.\n\nTo determine the phenotype, we look for the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. If either gene shows dominance, the bird is colored or has the corresponding pigmentation.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered red.\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; b (recessive) \u2192 plain \u2192 Checkered plain.\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; b (recessive) \u2192 plain \u2192 Checkered plain.\n7. cc BB \u2192 c (recessive) \u2192 plain; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c (recessive) \u2192 plain; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n9. cc bb \u2192 c (recessive) \u2192 plain; b (recessive) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Phenotype 1 (CC BB), 4 (Cc BB), 5 (Cc Bb) \u2192 3 individuals.\n- **Checkered brown**: Phenotype 2 (CC Bb), 3 (CC bb), 6 (Cc Bb) \u2192 3 individuals.\n- **Plain red**: Phenotype 3 (CC bb), 7 (cc BB), 8 (cc Bb) \u2192 3 individuals.\n- **Plain brown**: Phenotype 7 (cc BB), 9 (cc Bb) \u2192 2 individuals.\nWait, no, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (CC BB)\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (CC Bb)\nPhenotype 3: Checkered plain (CC bb)\nPhenotype 4: Checkered brown (Cc BB)\nPhenotype 5: Checkered brown (Cc Bb)\nPhenotype 6: Checkered plain (Cc bb)\nPhenotype 7: Plain brown (cc BB)\nPhenotype 8: Plain brown (cc Bb)\nPhenotype 9: Plain checkered (cc bb)\n\nWait, I might have miscounted earlier. Let's list each:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1\n- **Checkered brown**: 3 (2,4,5)\n- **Checkered plain**: 2 (3,6)\n- **Plain brown**: 2 (7,8)\n- **Plain checkered**: 1 (9)\n\nWait, but according to my previous count, there are three checkered brown, two checkered plain, two plain brown, and one plain checkered. That sums up to 9 birds, which makes sense for F2.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Checkered plain: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none directly match this. Let me check the options:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Another option is G: 12,2,2,0. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in either gene. So, any bird that has at least one C or one B will have a colored pigmentation, while those without either will be plain checkered.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Colored**: Any bird with at least one C or B \u2192 which includes all except plain checkered (cc bb).\n- **Plain checkered**: Only cc bb.\n\nBut according to the question, the phenotypes listed are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, perhaps the checkered plain (cc bb) is considered as plain, regardless of the alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered plain (cc bb) is considered as plain, and the other checkered (cc BB, cc Bb) are still checkered. Similarly, the plain red (cc bb) is plain, and the others like checkered red (CC BB) etc. are also checked against the presence of at least one dominant allele.\n\nBut regardless, the key is to group the phenotypes correctly.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, the counts were:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Checkered plain: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Wait, let me re-examine:\n\nWait, the question says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". But that adds up to 16, which doesn't make sense because the F2 generation should have 9 birds.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB ( homozygous dominant for both genes )\nParent 2: cc bb ( homozygous recessive )\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be all CcBb (since each parent can only give CB or cb gametes). Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Bb (from CB + cb): 50%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are a combination of these probabilities, leading to 16 possible phenotypes. However, many will be the same due to dominance.\n\nBut focusing on the phenotypes:\n\n- **Red-colored (C is dominant)**: Any bird with at least one C will be red, unless it's plain checkered (cc bb). So, the red phenotype includes:\n\n  - All checkered red (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb)\n  - All checkered brown (CC BB is already red; CC Bb is red; BB is red; but wait, no, BB is brown, right? Wait, no, the checkered are the ones where both genes are recessive. So:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- So, if both C and B are present, the bird is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is present but B is not, the bird is Checkered Red.\n- If neither C nor B is present, the bird is Plain Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: Presence of C (C_) \u2192 red, but no B (bb) \u2192 plain.\n- Checkered Brown: Presence of B (B_) \u2192 brown, but no C (cc) \u2192 plain.\n- Plain Red: Both C and B absent \u2192 red, but no plain (wait, no, plain is when both are recessive. So, if a bird is red (has C) and brown (has B), then it's brown-red. If it's red (C) and not brown (bb), it's plain red. Similarly, if it's brown (B) and not red (cc), it's plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure it better.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in either gene.\n\nSo:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then regardless of B, the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), then regardless of C, the bird is brown.\n- So, if both C and B are present, the bird is brown-red (Checkered Brown).\n- If C is present but B is not, the bird is red (Checkered Red).\n- If B is present but C is not, the bird is brown (Checkered Brown).\n- If neither C nor B is present, the bird is plain (Checkered Plain).\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Checkered Red**: C present (CC or Cc) and B absent (bb)\n2. **Checkered Brown**: B present (BB or Bb) and C absent (cc)\n3. **Plain Red**: Neither C nor B present (cc and bb)\n4. **Plain Brown**: B present (BB or Bb) and C absent (cc)\n\nWait, but hold on. If a bird has both C and B, it's brown-red (Checkered Brown). If it has C but not B, it's red (Checkered Red). If it has B but not C, it's brown (Checkered Brown). If it has neither, it's plain (Checkered Plain).\n\nSo, now let's calculate the number of birds in each category based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered Red (since C is present and B is not)\n- Cc (50%): Checkered Brown (since B is present and C is not)\n- cc (25%): Checkered Plain (both C and B are missing)\n\nAdditionally, within each genotype, the phenotypes depend on the alleles. So, for example:\n\n- CC (red) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc (plain) \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nSo, the total number of birds in each phenotype is:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 25% of F2 \u2192 Assuming F2 population is 9 (as in a dihybrid cross), 25% of 9 is 2.25, but since we can't have fractions, perhaps it's rounded to 2 or 3 depending on exact calculation.\n\nWait, let's approach this differently. In F2, the proportion of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25% (1/4)\n- Cc: 50% (1/2)\n- cc: 25% (1/4)\n\nWithin each genotype, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo:\n\n- **CC (red)**: Always Checkered Red\n- **Cc (brown)**: Always Checkered Brown\n- **cc (plain)**: Always Checkered Plain\n\nSince the question groups Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, and Plain Brown into separate categories, even though technically some could overlap, perhaps the intended grouping is based solely on the presence of dominant alleles. Thus:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: CC (1/4)\n- **Checkered Brown**: Cc (1/2)\n- **Plain Red**: cc (1/4)\n- **Plain Brown**: None, because any bird with C or B is brown-red.\n\nWait, no, because if a bird has C, it's red, and if it has B, it's brown. So, all birds with C or B are brown-red, which fits under Checkered Brown. Those without either are plain, under Checkered Plain.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic ratios based on the actual genotypes would be:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 1/4 of F2 \u2192 9 * 1/4 = 2.25 \u2248 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: 1/2 \u2192 4.5 \u2248 4.5, but since we can't have half birds, it might be 4 or 5. Looking at the options, option D has 1,3,9,3, which seems off.\nWait, another approach: perhaps the F2 population is 16 birds (since each gene has 2 alleles, and for two genes, 4^2=16). Let's recalculate with 16 birds.\n\nIf F2 is 16 birds:\n\n- CC (25%): 4 birds \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc (50%): 8 birds \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc (25%): 4 birds \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4\n- Checkered Brown: 8\n- Checkered Plain: 4\n\nBut the question groups Checkered Red and Plain Red together, which may not align with reality, as Checkered Plain is plain, while Checkered Red is red. Similarly, Checkered Brown is brown, whereas Checkered Plain is plain. So, perhaps the grouping is done based on the presence of dominant alleles, making:\n\n- **Checkered Red/Brown**: Any bird with C or B \u2192 brown-red\n- **Plain Red/Plain Brown**: Birds without either \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- **Brown-Red**: 12 (all with C or B)\n- **Plain**: 4 (none have C or B)\n\nBut that doesn't fit the options provided.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThis suggests 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That doesn't seem right because all birds with C or B would be brown-red, not red.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question groups Checkered Red and Checkered Brown separately, but doesn't include Plain Red or Plain Brown. However, the options don't reflect this.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nTotal: 16 birds. So, 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That doesn't make sense because all birds with C or B are brown-red, so checkered red and plain red shouldn't exist. The same applies to brown and plain brown.\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16. This implies that half the birds are red, half are brown. But according to our earlier analysis, 12 are brown-red, and 4 are plain. So this doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Again, all birds with C or B are brown-red, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16. Again, all brown-red.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This implies that 1 bird is checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. That doesn't make sense because all birds with C or B would be brown-red.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 This suggests 100% of the birds are brown-red, which isn't true because some would be plain.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm confused. According to my calculations, the F2 should have:\n\n- 25% Checkered Red (CC)\n- 50% Checkered Brown (Cc)\n- 25% Checkered Plain (cc)\n\nWhich translates to 4 Checkered Red, 8 Checkered Brown, and 4 Checkered Plain birds if F2 is 16. But none of the options reflect this. Perhaps I made a mistake in the interpretation of the phenotypes.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assign numerical values based on dominance.\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be assigned a score based on the presence of dominant alleles. For simplicity, let's say:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 points (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Brown: 1 point (B present, C absent)\n- Plain Red: 0 points (Neither present)\n- Plain Brown: -1 point (Both absent)\n\nThen, the total scores would be:\n\n- CC (2): 2\n- Cc (1): 1\n- cc (0): 0\n\nWait, but this approach might not capture the full picture. Alternatively, let's use a scoring system where each dominant allele gives a certain point. For example, each C gives +1, each B gives +1, and no points for recessive. Then, the total score would indicate the phenotype:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C (+1), it's red.\n- If it has",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% (CB + CB) = CC BB\n- 25% (CB + cb) = Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb + CB) = Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb + cb) = cc bb\n\nBut looking back at the options given, some mention different F2 ratios. However, the question asks specifically about the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To determine the phenotype, we look at both genes.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the combination of C/c and B/b alleles. The dominant alleles are expressed, so if either C or B is present, the bird is colored or has the appropriate pigmentation.\n\nSo, let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether both C and B are present (i.e., C B), or any one of them is present (either C or B).\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid scenario. Each bird's genotype can be represented as a combination of C/B and c/b.\n\nTo determine the phenotype, we look for the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. If either gene shows dominance, the bird is colored or has the corresponding pigmentation.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered red.\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; b (recessive) \u2192 plain \u2192 Checkered plain.\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (dominant) \u2192 red; b (recessive) \u2192 plain \u2192 Checkered plain.\n7. cc BB \u2192 c (recessive) \u2192 plain; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c (recessive) \u2192 plain; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n9. cc bb \u2192 c (recessive) \u2192 plain; b (recessive) \u2192 checkered \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- **Checkered red**: Phenotype 1 (CC BB), 4 (Cc BB), 5 (Cc Bb) \u2192 3 individuals.\n- **Checkered brown**: Phenotype 2 (CC Bb), 3 (CC bb), 6 (Cc Bb) \u2192 3 individuals.\n- **Plain red**: Phenotype 3 (CC bb), 7 (cc BB), 8 (cc Bb) \u2192 3 individuals.\n- **Plain brown**: Phenotype 7 (cc BB), 9 (cc Bb) \u2192 2 individuals.\nWait, no, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (CC BB)\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (CC Bb)\nPhenotype 3: Checkered plain (CC bb)\nPhenotype 4: Checkered brown (Cc BB)\nPhenotype 5: Checkered brown (Cc Bb)\nPhenotype 6: Checkered plain (Cc bb)\nPhenotype 7: Plain brown (cc BB)\nPhenotype 8: Plain brown (cc Bb)\nPhenotype 9: Plain checkered (cc bb)\n\nWait, I might have miscounted earlier. Let's list each:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- **Checkered red**: 1\n- **Checkered brown**: 3 (2,4,5)\n- **Checkered plain**: 2 (3,6)\n- **Plain brown**: 2 (7,8)\n- **Plain checkered**: 1 (9)\n\nWait, but according to my previous count, there are three checkered brown, two checkered plain, two plain brown, and one plain checkered. That sums up to 9 birds, which makes sense for F2.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Checkered plain: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none directly match this. Let me check the options:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Another option is G: 12,2,2,0. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in either gene. So, any bird that has at least one C or one B will have a colored pigmentation, while those without either will be plain checkered.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- **Colored**: Any bird with at least one C or B \u2192 which includes all except plain checkered (cc bb).\n- **Plain checkered**: Only cc bb.\n\nBut according to the question, the phenotypes listed are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, perhaps the checkered plain (cc bb) is considered as plain, regardless of the alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered plain (cc bb) is considered as plain, and the other checkered (cc BB, cc Bb) are still checkered. Similarly, the plain red (cc bb) is plain, and the others like checkered red (CC BB) etc. are also checked against the presence of at least one dominant allele.\n\nBut regardless, the key is to group the phenotypes correctly.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, the counts were:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Checkered plain: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Wait, let me re-examine:\n\nWait, the question says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". But that adds up to 16, which doesn't make sense because the F2 generation should have 9 birds.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me double-check the parents' genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB ( homozygous dominant for both genes )\nParent 2: cc bb ( homozygous recessive )\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be all CcBb (since each parent can only give CB or cb gametes). Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Bb (from CB + cb): 50%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are a combination of these probabilities, leading to 16 possible phenotypes. However, many will be the same due to dominance.\n\nBut focusing on the phenotypes:\n\n- **Red-colored (C is dominant)**: Any bird with at least one C will be red, unless it's plain checkered (cc bb). So, the red phenotype includes:\n\n  - All checkered red (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb)\n  - All checkered brown (CC BB is already red; CC Bb is red; BB is red; but wait, no, BB is brown, right? Wait, no, the checkered are the ones where both genes are recessive. So:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- So, if both C and B are present, the bird is Checkered Brown.\n- If C is present but B is not, the bird is Checkered Red.\n- If neither C nor B is present, the bird is Plain Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: Presence of C (C_) \u2192 red, but no B (bb) \u2192 plain.\n- Checkered Brown: Presence of B (B_) \u2192 brown, but no C (cc) \u2192 plain.\n- Plain Red: Both C and B absent \u2192 red, but no plain (wait, no, plain is when both are recessive. So, if a bird is red (has C) and brown (has B), then it's brown-red. If it's red (C) and not brown (bb), it's plain red. Similarly, if it's brown (B) and not red (cc), it's plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure it better.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele in either gene.\n\nSo:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then regardless of B, the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), then regardless of C, the bird is brown.\n- So, if both C and B are present, the bird is brown-red (Checkered Brown).\n- If C is present but B is not, the bird is red (Checkered Red).\n- If B is present but C is not, the bird is brown (Checkered Brown).\n- If neither C nor B is present, the bird is plain (Checkered Plain).\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Checkered Red**: C present (CC or Cc) and B absent (bb)\n2. **Checkered Brown**: B present (BB or Bb) and C absent (cc)\n3. **Plain Red**: Neither C nor B present (cc and bb)\n4. **Plain Brown**: B present (BB or Bb) and C absent (cc)\n\nWait, but hold on. If a bird has both C and B, it's brown-red (Checkered Brown). If it has C but not B, it's red (Checkered Red). If it has B but not C, it's brown (Checkered Brown). If it has neither, it's plain (Checkered Plain).\n\nSo, now let's calculate the number of birds in each category based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered Red (since C is present and B is not)\n- Cc (50%): Checkered Brown (since B is present and C is not)\n- cc (25%): Checkered Plain (both C and B are missing)\n\nAdditionally, within each genotype, the phenotypes depend on the alleles. So, for example:\n\n- CC (red) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc (plain) \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nSo, the total number of birds in each phenotype is:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 25% of F2 \u2192 Assuming F2 population is 9 (as in a dihybrid cross), 25% of 9 is 2.25, but since we can't have fractions, perhaps it's rounded to 2 or 3 depending on exact calculation.\n\nWait, let's approach this differently. In F2, the proportion of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25% (1/4)\n- Cc: 50% (1/2)\n- cc: 25% (1/4)\n\nWithin each genotype, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo:\n\n- **CC (red)**: Always Checkered Red\n- **Cc (brown)**: Always Checkered Brown\n- **cc (plain)**: Always Checkered Plain\n\nSince the question groups Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, and Plain Brown into separate categories, even though technically some could overlap, perhaps the intended grouping is based solely on the presence of dominant alleles. Thus:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: CC (1/4)\n- **Checkered Brown**: Cc (1/2)\n- **Plain Red**: cc (1/4)\n- **Plain Brown**: None, because any bird with C or B is brown-red.\n\nWait, no, because if a bird has C, it's red, and if it has B, it's brown. So, all birds with C or B are brown-red, which fits under Checkered Brown. Those without either are plain, under Checkered Plain.\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic ratios based on the actual genotypes would be:\n\n- **Checkered Red**: 1/4 of F2 \u2192 9 * 1/4 = 2.25 \u2248 2\n- **Checkered Brown**: 1/2 \u2192 4.5 \u2248 4.5, but since we can't have half birds, it might be 4 or 5. Looking at the options, option D has 1,3,9,3, which seems off.\nWait, another approach: perhaps the F2 population is 16 birds (since each gene has 2 alleles, and for two genes, 4^2=16). Let's recalculate with 16 birds.\n\nIf F2 is 16 birds:\n\n- CC (25%): 4 birds \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc (50%): 8 birds \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc (25%): 4 birds \u2192 Checkered Plain\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 4\n- Checkered Brown: 8\n- Checkered Plain: 4\n\nBut the question groups Checkered Red and Plain Red together, which may not align with reality, as Checkered Plain is plain, while Checkered Red is red. Similarly, Checkered Brown is brown, whereas Checkered Plain is plain. So, perhaps the grouping is done based on the presence of dominant alleles, making:\n\n- **Checkered Red/Brown**: Any bird with C or B \u2192 brown-red\n- **Plain Red/Plain Brown**: Birds without either \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- **Brown-Red**: 12 (all with C or B)\n- **Plain**: 4 (none have C or B)\n\nBut that doesn't fit the options provided.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nThis suggests 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. That doesn't seem right because all birds with C or B would be brown-red, not red.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question groups Checkered Red and Checkered Brown separately, but doesn't include Plain Red or Plain Brown. However, the options don't reflect this.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nTotal: 16 birds. So, 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That doesn't make sense because all birds with C or B are brown-red, so checkered red and plain red shouldn't exist. The same applies to brown and plain brown.\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16. This implies that half the birds are red, half are brown. But according to our earlier analysis, 12 are brown-red, and 4 are plain. So this doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Again, all birds with C or B are brown-red, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16. Again, all brown-red.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This implies that 1 bird is checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, and 3 plain brown. That doesn't make sense because all birds with C or B would be brown-red.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 This suggests 100% of the birds are brown-red, which isn't true because some would be plain.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm confused. According to my calculations, the F2 should have:\n\n- 25% Checkered Red (CC)\n- 50% Checkered Brown (Cc)\n- 25% Checkered Plain (cc)\n\nWhich translates to 4 Checkered Red, 8 Checkered Brown, and 4 Checkered Plain birds if F2 is 16. But none of the options reflect this. Perhaps I made a mistake in the interpretation of the phenotypes.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assign numerical values based on dominance.\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be assigned a score based on the presence of dominant alleles. For simplicity, let's say:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 points (C present, B absent)\n- Checkered Brown: 1 point (B present, C absent)\n- Plain Red: 0 points (Neither present)\n- Plain Brown: -1 point (Both absent)\n\nThen, the total scores would be:\n\n- CC (2): 2\n- Cc (1): 1\n- cc (0): 0\n\nWait, but this approach might not capture the full picture. Alternatively, let's use a scoring system where each dominant allele gives a certain point. For example, each C gives +1, each B gives +1, and no points for recessive. Then, the total score would indicate the phenotype:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C (+1), it's red.\n- If it has",

    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes one allele.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes one allele. So for each gene, there are two possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each gene separately and then combine the results. Let's do that. First, let's look at gene C:\n\nParent 1: CC (so always C)\nParent 2: cc (always c)\n\nSo F1: Cc, F2: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n\nParent 1: BB (always B)\nParent 2: bb (always b)\n\nSo F1: Bb, F2: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination of these probabilities would multiply. So the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes' outcomes.\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two pairs of genes: C (pigment) and B (color).\n\nThe phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nFor pigment color (gene C):\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain.\n\nFor color (gene B):\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotype is a combination of both traits. Let's list all possible combinations and assign them to categories:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red brown (checkered)\n2. C_ and b_: red checkered (plain)\n3. c_ and B_: plain brown\n4. c_ and b_: plain checkered\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, and the plain color by the recessive allele b. Wait, that might mean:\n\nWait, the wording says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nHmm, that suggests that:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red (pigment).\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain (no pigment).\n\nWait, but the problem also mentions color determination: red (dominant B) vs. brown (recessive b). Similarly, checkered (dominant c) vs. plain (recessive b).\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nGene C controls pigment:\n\n- C_ = red (pigment)\n- c_ = plain (no pigment)\n\nGene B controls color:\n\n- B_ = brown (color)\n- b_ = checkered (pattern)\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of both:\n\nIf the bird has pigment (C_), and is brown (B_), then it's red brown.\n\nIf the bird has pigment (C_), but is checkered (b_), then it's red checkered.\n\nIf it doesn't have pigment (c_), regardless of color, it's plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because if it doesn't have pigment (c_), it's plain, regardless of whether it's brown or checkered.\n\nWait, let's structure it properly:\n\nPhenotype Determination:\n\n- Pigment (C): \n  - C_: red\n  - c_: plain\n\n- Color (B):\n  - B_: brown\n  - b_: checkered\n\nSo the phenotype combines both:\n\nPossible Combinations:\n\n1. Pigment present (C_) AND Color present (B_)\n   - Red Brown (checkered)\n2. Pigment present (C_) AND Color absent (b_)\n   - Red Checkered (plain)\n3. Pigment absent (c_) AND Color present (B_)\n   - Plain Brown (checkered)\n4. Pigment absent (c_) AND Color absent (b_)\n   - Plain (both)\n\nSo, four possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, we'll use the Punnett square approach, considering each gene independently.\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities for each gene:\n\nGene C:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (always C)\n- Parent 2: cc (always c)\n- F1: Cc (probability 100% C and c)\n- F2: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nGene B:\n\n- Parent 1: BB (always B)\n- Parent 2: bb (always b)\n- F1: Bb (probability 100% B and b)\n- F2: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nAssuming independent assortment, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nLet's create a table for the four possible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. C_ (pigment present) AND B_ (color present) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_ (pigment present) AND b_ (color absent) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c_ (pigment absent) AND B_ (color present) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c_ (pigment absent) AND b_ (color absent) \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for pigment (C):\n\n- Probability C_ = 1 (since C is always present in F2)\n- Probability c_ = 0.25\n\nColor (B):\n\n- Probability B_ = 1 (since B is always present in F2)\n- Probability b_ = 0.25\n\nNow, since the genes are independent:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_ AND B_):\n   - Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = 1 * 1 = 1\n   - But wait, that can't be right because each bird must have two alleles. Actually, the correct way is to consider all combinations where either C is present OR B is present, depending on the dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that each trait is determined by the presence of the allele, not the combination. So, for a bird to be red brown, it needs at least one red (C) allele and at least one brown (B) allele. Conversely, for red checkered, it needs a red allele (C) but no brown (B), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model each bird's phenotype based on the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), it's red.\n- Regardless of color (B), it has pigment (C_).\n- So, if C_ is present, the bird is red, unless B_ is also present (which makes it brown?), but wait, no\u2014because pigment (C_) already implies red, but color (B_) adds brown or checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has C_, it's red, regardless of B_. So:\n\n- If C_ is present, the bird is red.\n  - If B_ is present (brown), then it's red brown.\n  - If b_ is present (checkered), it's red checkered.\n\n- If c_ is present, the bird is plain, regardless of B_.\n\nSo, the phenotype depends solely on C_: if C_ is present, red (with possible brown or checkered); otherwise, plain.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. C_ (pigment present) AND B_ (color present) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_ (pigment present) AND b_ (color absent) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c_ (pigment absent) AND B_ (color present) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c_ (pigment absent) AND b_ (color absent) \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_ AND B_):\n   - Since C_ is certain (100%) and B_ is certain (100%), the probability is 1 * 1 = 1 (but this seems off because each bird must have two alleles, so perhaps the actual calculation considers all possible combinations.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of all possible combinations of C and B alleles in the F2 population.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has two alleles for each gene. Since the genes are independent, the number of possible genotypes is 3^2 = 9 (for two genes). However, phenotypes depend on the presence or absence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, for each gene, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- C_ : C_ (pigment present)\n- c_ : c_ (pigment absent)\n\nAnd similarly for B:\n\n- B_ : B_ (color present)\n- b_ : b_ (color absent)\n\nThe phenotype is determined by the combination of these:\n\n1. C_ AND B_ \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_ AND b_ \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c_ AND B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c_ AND b_ \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation, then convert to phenotypes.\n\nUsing Mendelian inheritance:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - Frequency of CC: 25%\n  - Frequency of Cc: 50%\n  - Frequency of cc: 25%\n\n- For gene B:\n  - Frequency of BB: 25%\n  - Frequency of Bb: 50%\n  - Frequency of bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, we can make a grid of all possible combinations:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n2. CC Bb: Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n3. CC bb: Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n4. Cc BB: Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n5. Cc Bb: Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n6. Cc bb: Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n7. cc BB: Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n8. cc Bb: Plain Checkered (phenotype 4)\n9. cc bb: Plain (phenotype 4)\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%?\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s percentages, so:\n\nLooking back, the grid corresponds directly to the percentage of each genotype. So:\n\nRed Brown (cases 1, 4): 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%?\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each cell represents a specific percentage of the population. So:\n\nRed Brown occurs in cases 1 (6.25%), 4 (12.5%), and another case? Wait, no\u2014in our grid, each cell is a specific genotype. So:\n\nRed Brown: CC BB (6.25%), Cc BB (12.5%) \u2192 Total 18.75%\nRed Checkered: CC Bb (12.5%), Cc Bb (25%) \u2192 Total 37.5%\nPlain Brown: CC bb (6.25%), Cc bb (12.5%), cc BB (6.25%) \u2192 Total 25%\nPlain: cc Bb (12.5%), cc bb (6.25%) \u2192 Total 18.75%\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let's recalculate:\n\nTotal for each phenotype:\n\n1. Red Brown: 6.25% (CC BB) + 12.5% (Cc BB) = 18.75%\n2. Red Checkered: 12.5% (CC Bb) + 25% (Cc Bb) = 37.5%\n3. Plain Brown: 6.25% (CC bb) + 12.5% (Cc bb) + 6.25% (cc BB) = 25%\n4. Plain: 12.5% (cc Bb) + 6.25% (cc bb) = 18.75%\n\nAdding these up: 18.75 + 37.5 + 25 + 18.75 = 99%, which is close enough due to rounding. So the approximate phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red Brown: ~18.75%\n- Red Checkered: ~37.5%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain: ~18.75%\n\nBut looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let's see the options:\n\nOptions A to H don't include any fractions like 18.75%. They probably expect rounded numbers or exact counts.\n\nWait, the options are likely showing the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation without converting to percentages. Let's try that approach.\n\nTotal possible genotypes in F2: 16 (since 4x4 grid). Wait, no\u2014the Punnett square is 4x4, so 16 possible genotypes.\n\nCalculating the number of each genotype:\n\nFrom earlier grid:\n\n- CC BB: 1 (25% of 16=4)\n- CC Bb: 2 (50% of 16=8)\n- CC bb: 1 (25% of 16=4)\n- Cc BB: 2 (50% of 16=8)\n- Cc Bb: 4 (25% of 16=6.25, but wait, 50% of 16 is 8, but earlier calculation said 4?)\nWait, confusion arises because earlier I considered percentages, but in reality, each cell is a specific genotype count.\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in terms of actual counts. Since each bird has two alleles, the total number of possible alleles is 16 (4 birds x 4 alleles each). But for counting, each bird's genotype is considered individually.\n\nWait, perhaps a different approach: each parent contributes two alleles, so F1 has four alleles (two from each parent). When F1 selfs, the F2 has eight alleles (four from each parent). But the F2 population consists of 16 birds (since each parent contributes four alleles, making 8, but each bird has two alleles, so 8/2=4 birds, but no\u2014actually, each bird is formed by two alleles, so 4 birds x 2 alleles = 8 alleles. Wait, confusion here.\n\nActually, each parent contributes two alleles, so F1 (CcBb) contributes four alleles (two Cs and two Bs). When F1 selfs, F2 receives six alleles from each parent? Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes four alleles (two from each parent), so F2 has eight alleles, forming four birds. So 16 possible combinations (4 birds x 4 alleles each). But the actual count per phenotype would be based on the number of each genotype.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the counts:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. So for gene C:\n\n- Possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- Possible genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nCombined, each bird's genotype is a pair of these.\n\nThe number of each genotype in F2 is:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of 16 birds = 4\n- CC Bb: 50% of 16 = 8\n- CC bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Cc BB: 50% of 16 = 8\n- Cc Bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Cc bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n- cc BB: 25% of 16 = 4\n- cc Bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n- cc bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (phenotype 4)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain (phenotype 4)\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1 (4) and 4 (8) \u2192 12 birds\n- Red Checkered: Cases 2 (8) and 5 (4) \u2192 12 birds\n- Plain Brown: Cases 3 (4), 6 (4), 7 (4) \u2192 12 birds\n- Plain: Cases 8 (4) and 9 (4) \u2192 8 birds\n\nSo the ratio is 12:12:12:8, which simplifies to 3:3:3:2.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption G: phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nNo, that's not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nNo, not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNo.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNo.\n\nWait, my calculated ratio was 12:12:12:8, which can be simplified to 3:3:3:2. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3+9+1+3=16, which matches the total. But the actual ratio",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes one allele. So for each gene, there are two possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each gene separately and then combine the results. Let's do that. First, let's look at gene C:\n\nParent 1: CC (so always C)\nParent 2: cc (always c)\n\nSo F1: Cc, F2: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n\nParent 1: BB (always B)\nParent 2: bb (always b)\n\nSo F1: Bb, F2: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination of these probabilities would multiply. So the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes' outcomes.\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two pairs of genes: C (pigment) and B (color).\n\nThe phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nFor pigment color (gene C):\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain.\n\nFor color (gene B):\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotype is a combination of both traits. Let's list all possible combinations and assign them to categories:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red brown (checkered)\n2. C_ and b_: red checkered (plain)\n3. c_ and B_: plain brown\n4. c_ and b_: plain checkered\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c, and the plain color by the recessive allele b. Wait, that might mean:\n\nWait, the wording says:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c.\n\nHmm, that suggests that:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red (pigment).\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain (no pigment).\n\nWait, but the problem also mentions color determination: red (dominant B) vs. brown (recessive b). Similarly, checkered (dominant c) vs. plain (recessive b).\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nGene C controls pigment:\n\n- C_ = red (pigment)\n- c_ = plain (no pigment)\n\nGene B controls color:\n\n- B_ = brown (color)\n- b_ = checkered (pattern)\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of both:\n\nIf the bird has pigment (C_), and is brown (B_), then it's red brown.\n\nIf the bird has pigment (C_), but is checkered (b_), then it's red checkered.\n\nIf it doesn't have pigment (c_), regardless of color, it's plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because if it doesn't have pigment (c_), it's plain, regardless of whether it's brown or checkered.\n\nWait, let's structure it properly:\n\nPhenotype Determination:\n\n- Pigment (C): \n  - C_: red\n  - c_: plain\n\n- Color (B):\n  - B_: brown\n  - b_: checkered\n\nSo the phenotype combines both:\n\nPossible Combinations:\n\n1. Pigment present (C_) AND Color present (B_)\n   - Red Brown (checkered)\n2. Pigment present (C_) AND Color absent (b_)\n   - Red Checkered (plain)\n3. Pigment absent (c_) AND Color present (B_)\n   - Plain Brown (checkered)\n4. Pigment absent (c_) AND Color absent (b_)\n   - Plain (both)\n\nSo, four possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, we'll use the Punnett square approach, considering each gene independently.\n\nFirst, let's find the probabilities for each gene:\n\nGene C:\n\n- Parent 1: CC (always C)\n- Parent 2: cc (always c)\n- F1: Cc (probability 100% C and c)\n- F2: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nGene B:\n\n- Parent 1: BB (always B)\n- Parent 2: bb (always b)\n- F1: Bb (probability 100% B and b)\n- F2: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nAssuming independent assortment, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nLet's create a table for the four possible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. C_ (pigment present) AND B_ (color present) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_ (pigment present) AND b_ (color absent) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c_ (pigment absent) AND B_ (color present) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c_ (pigment absent) AND b_ (color absent) \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for pigment (C):\n\n- Probability C_ = 1 (since C is always present in F2)\n- Probability c_ = 0.25\n\nColor (B):\n\n- Probability B_ = 1 (since B is always present in F2)\n- Probability b_ = 0.25\n\nNow, since the genes are independent:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_ AND B_):\n   - Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = 1 * 1 = 1\n   - But wait, that can't be right because each bird must have two alleles. Actually, the correct way is to consider all combinations where either C is present OR B is present, depending on the dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that each trait is determined by the presence of the allele, not the combination. So, for a bird to be red brown, it needs at least one red (C) allele and at least one brown (B) allele. Conversely, for red checkered, it needs a red allele (C) but no brown (B), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model each bird's phenotype based on the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), it's red.\n- Regardless of color (B), it has pigment (C_).\n- So, if C_ is present, the bird is red, unless B_ is also present (which makes it brown?), but wait, no\u2014because pigment (C_) already implies red, but color (B_) adds brown or checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has C_, it's red, regardless of B_. So:\n\n- If C_ is present, the bird is red.\n  - If B_ is present (brown), then it's red brown.\n  - If b_ is present (checkered), it's red checkered.\n\n- If c_ is present, the bird is plain, regardless of B_.\n\nSo, the phenotype depends solely on C_: if C_ is present, red (with possible brown or checkered); otherwise, plain.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. C_ (pigment present) AND B_ (color present) \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_ (pigment present) AND b_ (color absent) \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c_ (pigment absent) AND B_ (color present) \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c_ (pigment absent) AND b_ (color absent) \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_ AND B_):\n   - Since C_ is certain (100%) and B_ is certain (100%), the probability is 1 * 1 = 1 (but this seems off because each bird must have two alleles, so perhaps the actual calculation considers all possible combinations.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of all possible combinations of C and B alleles in the F2 population.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has two alleles for each gene. Since the genes are independent, the number of possible genotypes is 3^2 = 9 (for two genes). However, phenotypes depend on the presence or absence of dominant alleles.\n\nSo, for each gene, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- C_ : C_ (pigment present)\n- c_ : c_ (pigment absent)\n\nAnd similarly for B:\n\n- B_ : B_ (color present)\n- b_ : b_ (color absent)\n\nThe phenotype is determined by the combination of these:\n\n1. C_ AND B_ \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_ AND b_ \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c_ AND B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c_ AND b_ \u2192 Plain\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation, then convert to phenotypes.\n\nUsing Mendelian inheritance:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - Frequency of CC: 25%\n  - Frequency of Cc: 50%\n  - Frequency of cc: 25%\n\n- For gene B:\n  - Frequency of BB: 25%\n  - Frequency of Bb: 50%\n  - Frequency of bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, we can make a grid of all possible combinations:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n2. CC Bb: Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n3. CC bb: Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n4. Cc BB: Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n5. Cc Bb: Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n6. Cc bb: Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n7. cc BB: Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n8. cc Bb: Plain Checkered (phenotype 4)\n9. cc bb: Plain (phenotype 4)\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1, 4 \u2192 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%?\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s percentages, so:\n\nLooking back, the grid corresponds directly to the percentage of each genotype. So:\n\nRed Brown (cases 1, 4): 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%?\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each cell represents a specific percentage of the population. So:\n\nRed Brown occurs in cases 1 (6.25%), 4 (12.5%), and another case? Wait, no\u2014in our grid, each cell is a specific genotype. So:\n\nRed Brown: CC BB (6.25%), Cc BB (12.5%) \u2192 Total 18.75%\nRed Checkered: CC Bb (12.5%), Cc Bb (25%) \u2192 Total 37.5%\nPlain Brown: CC bb (6.25%), Cc bb (12.5%), cc BB (6.25%) \u2192 Total 25%\nPlain: cc Bb (12.5%), cc bb (6.25%) \u2192 Total 18.75%\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let's recalculate:\n\nTotal for each phenotype:\n\n1. Red Brown: 6.25% (CC BB) + 12.5% (Cc BB) = 18.75%\n2. Red Checkered: 12.5% (CC Bb) + 25% (Cc Bb) = 37.5%\n3. Plain Brown: 6.25% (CC bb) + 12.5% (Cc bb) + 6.25% (cc BB) = 25%\n4. Plain: 12.5% (cc Bb) + 6.25% (cc bb) = 18.75%\n\nAdding these up: 18.75 + 37.5 + 25 + 18.75 = 99%, which is close enough due to rounding. So the approximate phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red Brown: ~18.75%\n- Red Checkered: ~37.5%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain: ~18.75%\n\nBut looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let's see the options:\n\nOptions A to H don't include any fractions like 18.75%. They probably expect rounded numbers or exact counts.\n\nWait, the options are likely showing the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation without converting to percentages. Let's try that approach.\n\nTotal possible genotypes in F2: 16 (since 4x4 grid). Wait, no\u2014the Punnett square is 4x4, so 16 possible genotypes.\n\nCalculating the number of each genotype:\n\nFrom earlier grid:\n\n- CC BB: 1 (25% of 16=4)\n- CC Bb: 2 (50% of 16=8)\n- CC bb: 1 (25% of 16=4)\n- Cc BB: 2 (50% of 16=8)\n- Cc Bb: 4 (25% of 16=6.25, but wait, 50% of 16 is 8, but earlier calculation said 4?)\nWait, confusion arises because earlier I considered percentages, but in reality, each cell is a specific genotype count.\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in terms of actual counts. Since each bird has two alleles, the total number of possible alleles is 16 (4 birds x 4 alleles each). But for counting, each bird's genotype is considered individually.\n\nWait, perhaps a different approach: each parent contributes two alleles, so F1 has four alleles (two from each parent). When F1 selfs, the F2 has eight alleles (four from each parent). But the F2 population consists of 16 birds (since each parent contributes four alleles, making 8, but each bird has two alleles, so 8/2=4 birds, but no\u2014actually, each bird is formed by two alleles, so 4 birds x 2 alleles = 8 alleles. Wait, confusion here.\n\nActually, each parent contributes two alleles, so F1 (CcBb) contributes four alleles (two Cs and two Bs). When F1 selfs, F2 receives six alleles from each parent? Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes four alleles (two from each parent), so F2 has eight alleles, forming four birds. So 16 possible combinations (4 birds x 4 alleles each). But the actual count per phenotype would be based on the number of each genotype.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the counts:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. So for gene C:\n\n- Possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- Possible genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nCombined, each bird's genotype is a pair of these.\n\nThe number of each genotype in F2 is:\n\n- CC BB: 25% of 16 birds = 4\n- CC Bb: 50% of 16 = 8\n- CC bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Cc BB: 50% of 16 = 8\n- Cc Bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n- Cc bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n- cc BB: 25% of 16 = 4\n- cc Bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n- cc bb: 25% of 16 = 4\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown (phenotype 1)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Checkered (phenotype 2)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (phenotype 4)\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain (phenotype 4)\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1 (4) and 4 (8) \u2192 12 birds\n- Red Checkered: Cases 2 (8) and 5 (4) \u2192 12 birds\n- Plain Brown: Cases 3 (4), 6 (4), 7 (4) \u2192 12 birds\n- Plain: Cases 8 (4) and 9 (4) \u2192 8 birds\n\nSo the ratio is 12:12:12:8, which simplifies to 3:3:3:2.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption G: phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nNo, that's not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nNo, not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNo.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNo.\n\nWait, my calculated ratio was 12:12:12:8, which can be simplified to 3:3:3:2. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3+9+1+3=16, which matches the total. But the actual ratio",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes either CB or cb, leading to four combinations:",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes either CB or cb, leading to four combinations:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb):\n- CB gamete + CB gamete \u2192 CC BB\n- CB gamete + cb gamete \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb gamete + CB gamete \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb gamete + cb gamete \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: Each parent contributes one allele per gene. For the C locus: Parent 1 (CC) can only contribute C. Parent 2 (cc) can only contribute c. So the C locus in F1 (Cc) must be C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: Parent 1 (BB) can only contribute B, and Parent 2 (bb) can only contribute b. So the B locus in F1 (CcBb).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\nFor the C locus: C (from C) and c (from c) \u2192 50% C and 50% c.\nFor the B locus: B (from B) and b (from b) \u2192 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations of these, resulting in four possible genotypes:\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, the question mentions checking the phenotypes. So we'll map the genotypes to phenotypes based on the given dominance hierarchy. Let's define the phenotype order:\n\nFor the C locus: C > c\nFor the B locus: B > b\n\nSo, starting from the most dominant trait (the highest precedence), it would be B (brown) > b (checkered) > c (plain). Then, within each phenotype, the C locus affects the next level: C (red) > c (plain). So the phenotypic order from most to least dominant is:\n\n1. Brown and Red (B and C)\n2. Brown and Plain (B and c)\n3. Checkered and Red (b and C)\n4. Checkered and Plain (b and c)\n\nNow, looking at each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are present \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: B is present but c is present \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB: B is absent (since bb is recessive), but C is present \u2192 Checkered and Red \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: B is absent, but c is present \u2192 Checkered and Plain \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution among F2 is 25% Phenotype 1, 25% Phenotype 2, 25% Phenotype 3, and 25% Phenotype 4. However, the options don't include a 25% distribution. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, etc.\u2014nope.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014No.\n\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014No.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc.\u2014Not matching.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to fit exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in mapping the genotypes to phenotypes. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy.\n\nThe hierarchy is:\n\n- Dominant alleles override recessive ones. So, the order of dominance is:\n\n1. B (dominant over b)\n2. C (dominant over c)\n\nSo, the first trait (Brown) is influenced by B, and if B is absent, then the second trait (Plain) is influenced by c. Within each trait, the presence of the dominant allele overrides the recessive one. So, for example:\n\n- If an individual has B and C, they exhibit the B (brown) trait, and since C is dominant, they also exhibit the C (red) trait. So, they have Brown and Red.\n\n- If an individual has B and c, they exhibit Brown (B) but since c is recessive, they don't exhibit Red.\n\n- If they have b and C, they have Checkered (c) and Red (C).\n\n- If they have b and c, they have Checkered and Plain.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are ordered as follows: Brown and Red > Brown and Plain > Checkered and Red > Checkered and Plain.\n\nIn terms of counts, the F2 would be 25% each for the four phenotypes. However, the options don't reflect this exact distribution. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\u2014Not matching.\n\nOption H: 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014No.\n\nOption I: 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, etc.\u2014No.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 CR, 2 RB...\n\nB. 8 CR, 4 RB...\n\nC. 9 CR, 3 RB...\n\nD. 1 CR, 3 RB...\n\nE. 3 CR, 9 RB...\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of individuals. Because the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (since F1 is 4, F2 is 4\u00d74=16). So, each option seems to represent the count of each phenotype in the entire F2 population.\n\nGiven that each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, the expected numbers would be 4 (for each phenotype), but the options don't reflect this. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the genotypic frequencies before phenotyping, but the options refer to the phenotypic ratios. Given that, perhaps the options are misrepresented, or I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another approach: Calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nEach F2 individual has four possible combinations:\n\n- 25% CC BB (phenotype 1)\n- 25% CC Bb (phenotype 2)\n- 25% cc BB (phenotype 3)\n- 25% cc Bb (phenotype 4)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. But the options don't list this exactly. Perhaps the options consider only the first two traits, ignoring the last two.\n\nWait, no, the options are showing four phenotypes, each with a certain count.\n\nLooking again at Option E: checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). That sums up to 16, which matches the total F2 population. How did we get those numbers?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nIf the F2 population is 16, and the options are showing how many fall into each phenotype category, then:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 3): 3 (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 2 (cc BB) + 2 (cc Bb) = 4? Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. CR: 25% \u2192 4\n2. CB: 25% \u2192 4\n3. CR: 25% \u2192 4\n4. CB: 25% \u2192 4\n\nBut if the options are grouping them differently, perhaps they're aggregating multiple categories. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the B locus is considered after C. So, for each individual, we check the B locus first, and if B is present, then check the C locus. Otherwise, check the c locus.\n\nSo, for the F2:\n\n- 25% CC BB: Both B and C are present \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 CR\n- 25% CC Bb: B is present \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n- 25% cc BB: B is absent \u2192 Checkered and Red \u2192 CR\n- 25% cc Bb: B is absent \u2192 Checkered and Plain \u2192 CP\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are CR, CP, CR, and CP. Thus, in F2:\n\n- CR: 50% (25% + 25%) \u2192 8\n- CP: 50% (25% + 25%) \u2192 8\n\nWait, this contradicts earlier conclusions. Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Let me verify:\n\nOrdering the dominance:\n\n1. Brown (B) > Checkered (b)\nWithin Brown:\n2. Red (C) > Plain (c)\nSo,\n\nCR: Brown and Red (B and C)\nCP: Brown and Plain (B and c)\nCR: Checkered and Red (b and C)\nCP: Checkered and Plain (b and c)\n\nThus, in F2:\n\n- CR: 25% (CC BB, cc BB)\n- CP: 25% (CC Bb, cc Bb)\n- CR: 25% (cc BB, cc Bb?) Wait, no, CC BB and cc BB are CR, while CC Bb and cc Bb are CP.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me list all F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: B and C \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 CR\n2. CC Bb: B and c \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n3. cc BB: B and c \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n4. cc Bb: b and c \u2192 Checkered and Plain \u2192 CP\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, for each genotype:\n\n- For CC BB: B and C \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 CR\n- For CC Bb: B and c \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n- For cc BB: B and c \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n- For cc Bb: b and c \u2192 Checkered and Plain \u2192 CP\n\nWait, but that would mean CR is 25%, and CP is 75%. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3 (CR : CP). But the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me try again.\n\nDominance hierarchy:\n\n- B (dominant) > b (recessive)\n- C (dominant) > c (recessive)\n\nSo, any individual with B has the Brown phenotype, unless B is absent. Similarly, within Brown, having C gives Red, else plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Brown and Red (B and C)\n2. Brown and Plain (B and c)\n3. Checkered and Red (b and C)\n4. Checkered and Plain (b and c)\n\nThus, in F2:\n\n- CR: 25% (B and C) \u2192 4\n- CP: 25% (B and c) \u2192 4\n- CR: 25% (b and C) \u2192 4\n- CP: 25% (b and c) \u2192 4\n\nTotal 16, which adds up to 16.\n\nBut according to this, each phenotype occurs 4 times, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options match this. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A-D have counts like 6, 2, etc., which don't align with 4 each. Options E and others have higher numbers, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking for the phenotypic ratio but rather the genotypic ratio. Let me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". So, I was correct in calculating the phenotypic ratio as 1:1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this. This suggests that perhaps my understanding of the dominance hierarchy is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the dominance hierarchy is reversed. Sometimes, the order is given as recessive first, then dominant. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem says:\n\n- Red is controlled by C, and brown by B. Red is dominant, brown is dominant.\n\nWait, no\u2014it says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, hold on! This is crucial. The problem states that red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, the hierarchy is:\n\n- Brown (b) is recessive, so brown appears only when both alleles are b.\n- Red (C) is dominant, so red appears when at least one allele is C.\n\nThis changes the dominance hierarchy. So, in terms of phenotype expression:\n\n- If you have at least one C (C_), you express red.\n- If you have at least one b, regardless of C, you express brown.\n\nTherefore, the order is:\n\n1. Brown (b) > Red (C)\n\nBecause, even without the C allele, you still have brown due to the recessive b allele.\n\nWait, now that makes sense. So, the hierarchy is:\n\n- Brown (b) is expressed over Red (C).\n- Red is expressed over brown if there's no brown allele.\n\nThis completely changes the analysis. So, the phenotypic order should be:\n\n1. Brown (b present)\n2. Red (C present)\n\nBecause even if someone has a b allele, they will display brown (since brown is recessive and requires both alleles to be b), whereas if they have at least one C, they display red.\n\nThis changes the way we calculate the phenotypic ratios. So, let's recalculate the F2 genotypes based on this corrected dominance hierarchy.\n\nFirst, determine the F1 genotypes. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for C and B)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for C and B)\n\nTheir F1 will receive one allele for each gene from each parent.\n\nFor the C locus (dominant, C):\n- Parent 1 provides C.\n- Parent 2 provides c.\n- So, F1 will be Cc (with probability 50%).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (recessive, b):\n- Parent 1 provides B.\n- Parent 2 provides b.\n- So, F1 will be Bb (with probability 50%).\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Since each parent contributes one allele per gene, the F1 will combine the alleles. For the C locus: Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 so F1 has Cc. For the B locus: Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 F1 has Bb.\n\nSo, the F1 genotype is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen F1 (Cc Bb) selfs, the possible gametes are:\n\n- From C locus: C (50%) and c (50%)\n- From B locus: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nThus, the gametes are:\n\n- CB (50%)\n- Cb (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nWait, no. Actually, each gene segregates independently, so the gametes will be a combination of C and B alleles, but more accurately, each gamete will carry either C or c from the C locus and either B or b from the B locus, in proportion.\n\nSince the F1 is Cc Bb, each gamete will have a 50% chance of being CB, Cb, cB, or cb.\n\nWait, no\u2014more precisely, the F1 can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB (C from C locus and B from B locus)\n- 25% Cb (C from C locus and b from B locus)\n- 25% cb (c from C locus and B from B locus)\n- 25% cb (c from C locus and b from B locus)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect.

Each gamete combines one allele from each gene. So, for the C locus, F1 is Cc, so gametes are C (50%) and c (50%). For the B locus, F1 is Bb, so gametes are B (50%) and b (50%). Combining these, the gametes are:\n\n- CB (25% [C from C locus and B from B locus])\n- Cb (25% [C from C locus and b from B locus])\n- cB (25% [c from C locus and B from B locus])\n- cb (25% [c from C locus and b from B locus])\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each parent contributes either CB or cb, leading to four combinations:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb):\n- CB gamete + CB gamete \u2192 CC BB\n- CB gamete + cb gamete \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb gamete + CB gamete \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb gamete + cb gamete \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: Each parent contributes one allele per gene. For the C locus: Parent 1 (CC) can only contribute C. Parent 2 (cc) can only contribute c. So the C locus in F1 (Cc) must be C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus: Parent 1 (BB) can only contribute B, and Parent 2 (bb) can only contribute b. So the B locus in F1 (CcBb).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\nFor the C locus: C (from C) and c (from c) \u2192 50% C and 50% c.\nFor the B locus: B (from B) and b (from b) \u2192 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations of these, resulting in four possible genotypes:\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, the question mentions checking the phenotypes. So we'll map the genotypes to phenotypes based on the given dominance hierarchy. Let's define the phenotype order:\n\nFor the C locus: C > c\nFor the B locus: B > b\n\nSo, starting from the most dominant trait (the highest precedence), it would be B (brown) > b (checkered) > c (plain). Then, within each phenotype, the C locus affects the next level: C (red) > c (plain). So the phenotypic order from most to least dominant is:\n\n1. Brown and Red (B and C)\n2. Brown and Plain (B and c)\n3. Checkered and Red (b and C)\n4. Checkered and Plain (b and c)\n\nNow, looking at each genotype in F2:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are present \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: B is present but c is present \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB: B is absent (since bb is recessive), but C is present \u2192 Checkered and Red \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc Bb: B is absent, but c is present \u2192 Checkered and Plain \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution among F2 is 25% Phenotype 1, 25% Phenotype 2, 25% Phenotype 3, and 25% Phenotype 4. However, the options don't include a 25% distribution. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, etc.\u2014nope.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014No.\n\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014No.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc.\u2014Not matching.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to fit exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in mapping the genotypes to phenotypes. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy.\n\nThe hierarchy is:\n\n- Dominant alleles override recessive ones. So, the order of dominance is:\n\n1. B (dominant over b)\n2. C (dominant over c)\n\nSo, the first trait (Brown) is influenced by B, and if B is absent, then the second trait (Plain) is influenced by c. Within each trait, the presence of the dominant allele overrides the recessive one. So, for example:\n\n- If an individual has B and C, they exhibit the B (brown) trait, and since C is dominant, they also exhibit the C (red) trait. So, they have Brown and Red.\n\n- If an individual has B and c, they exhibit Brown (B) but since c is recessive, they don't exhibit Red.\n\n- If they have b and C, they have Checkered (c) and Red (C).\n\n- If they have b and c, they have Checkered and Plain.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are ordered as follows: Brown and Red > Brown and Plain > Checkered and Red > Checkered and Plain.\n\nIn terms of counts, the F2 would be 25% each for the four phenotypes. However, the options don't reflect this exact distribution. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G: 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\u2014Not matching.\n\nOption H: 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014No.\n\nOption I: 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, etc.\u2014No.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 CR, 2 RB...\n\nB. 8 CR, 4 RB...\n\nC. 9 CR, 3 RB...\n\nD. 1 CR, 3 RB...\n\nE. 3 CR, 9 RB...\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of individuals. Because the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (since F1 is 4, F2 is 4\u00d74=16). So, each option seems to represent the count of each phenotype in the entire F2 population.\n\nGiven that each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, the expected numbers would be 4 (for each phenotype), but the options don't reflect this. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the genotypic frequencies before phenotyping, but the options refer to the phenotypic ratios. Given that, perhaps the options are misrepresented, or I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another approach: Calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nEach F2 individual has four possible combinations:\n\n- 25% CC BB (phenotype 1)\n- 25% CC Bb (phenotype 2)\n- 25% cc BB (phenotype 3)\n- 25% cc Bb (phenotype 4)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. But the options don't list this exactly. Perhaps the options consider only the first two traits, ignoring the last two.\n\nWait, no, the options are showing four phenotypes, each with a certain count.\n\nLooking again at Option E: checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). That sums up to 16, which matches the total F2 population. How did we get those numbers?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nIf the F2 population is 16, and the options are showing how many fall into each phenotype category, then:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 3): 3 (cc BB, cc Bb) \u2192 2 (cc BB) + 2 (cc Bb) = 4? Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. CR: 25% \u2192 4\n2. CB: 25% \u2192 4\n3. CR: 25% \u2192 4\n4. CB: 25% \u2192 4\n\nBut if the options are grouping them differently, perhaps they're aggregating multiple categories. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the B locus is considered after C. So, for each individual, we check the B locus first, and if B is present, then check the C locus. Otherwise, check the c locus.\n\nSo, for the F2:\n\n- 25% CC BB: Both B and C are present \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 CR\n- 25% CC Bb: B is present \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n- 25% cc BB: B is absent \u2192 Checkered and Red \u2192 CR\n- 25% cc Bb: B is absent \u2192 Checkered and Plain \u2192 CP\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are CR, CP, CR, and CP. Thus, in F2:\n\n- CR: 50% (25% + 25%) \u2192 8\n- CP: 50% (25% + 25%) \u2192 8\n\nWait, this contradicts earlier conclusions. Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Let me verify:\n\nOrdering the dominance:\n\n1. Brown (B) > Checkered (b)\nWithin Brown:\n2. Red (C) > Plain (c)\nSo,\n\nCR: Brown and Red (B and C)\nCP: Brown and Plain (B and c)\nCR: Checkered and Red (b and C)\nCP: Checkered and Plain (b and c)\n\nThus, in F2:\n\n- CR: 25% (CC BB, cc BB)\n- CP: 25% (CC Bb, cc Bb)\n- CR: 25% (cc BB, cc Bb?) Wait, no, CC BB and cc BB are CR, while CC Bb and cc Bb are CP.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me list all F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: B and C \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 CR\n2. CC Bb: B and c \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n3. cc BB: B and c \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n4. cc Bb: b and c \u2192 Checkered and Plain \u2192 CP\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, for each genotype:\n\n- For CC BB: B and C \u2192 Brown and Red \u2192 CR\n- For CC Bb: B and c \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n- For cc BB: B and c \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 CP\n- For cc Bb: b and c \u2192 Checkered and Plain \u2192 CP\n\nWait, but that would mean CR is 25%, and CP is 75%. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3 (CR : CP). But the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me try again.\n\nDominance hierarchy:\n\n- B (dominant) > b (recessive)\n- C (dominant) > c (recessive)\n\nSo, any individual with B has the Brown phenotype, unless B is absent. Similarly, within Brown, having C gives Red, else plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Brown and Red (B and C)\n2. Brown and Plain (B and c)\n3. Checkered and Red (b and C)\n4. Checkered and Plain (b and c)\n\nThus, in F2:\n\n- CR: 25% (B and C) \u2192 4\n- CP: 25% (B and c) \u2192 4\n- CR: 25% (b and C) \u2192 4\n- CP: 25% (b and c) \u2192 4\n\nTotal 16, which adds up to 16.\n\nBut according to this, each phenotype occurs 4 times, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options match this. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A-D have counts like 6, 2, etc., which don't align with 4 each. Options E and others have higher numbers, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking for the phenotypic ratio but rather the genotypic ratio. Let me read the question again: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". So, I was correct in calculating the phenotypic ratio as 1:1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this. This suggests that perhaps my understanding of the dominance hierarchy is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the dominance hierarchy is reversed. Sometimes, the order is given as recessive first, then dominant. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem says:\n\n- Red is controlled by C, and brown by B. Red is dominant, brown is dominant.\n\nWait, no\u2014it says:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, hold on! This is crucial. The problem states that red is dominant, and brown is recessive. So, the hierarchy is:\n\n- Brown (b) is recessive, so brown appears only when both alleles are b.\n- Red (C) is dominant, so red appears when at least one allele is C.\n\nThis changes the dominance hierarchy. So, in terms of phenotype expression:\n\n- If you have at least one C (C_), you express red.\n- If you have at least one b, regardless of C, you express brown.\n\nTherefore, the order is:\n\n1. Brown (b) > Red (C)\n\nBecause, even without the C allele, you still have brown due to the recessive b allele.\n\nWait, now that makes sense. So, the hierarchy is:\n\n- Brown (b) is expressed over Red (C).\n- Red is expressed over brown if there's no brown allele.\n\nThis completely changes the analysis. So, the phenotypic order should be:\n\n1. Brown (b present)\n2. Red (C present)\n\nBecause even if someone has a b allele, they will display brown (since brown is recessive and requires both alleles to be b), whereas if they have at least one C, they display red.\n\nThis changes the way we calculate the phenotypic ratios. So, let's recalculate the F2 genotypes based on this corrected dominance hierarchy.\n\nFirst, determine the F1 genotypes. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for C and B)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for C and B)\n\nTheir F1 will receive one allele for each gene from each parent.\n\nFor the C locus (dominant, C):\n- Parent 1 provides C.\n- Parent 2 provides c.\n- So, F1 will be Cc (with probability 50%).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (recessive, b):\n- Parent 1 provides B.\n- Parent 2 provides b.\n- So, F1 will be Bb (with probability 50%).\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Since each parent contributes one allele per gene, the F1 will combine the alleles. For the C locus: Parent 1 gives C, Parent 2 gives c \u2192 so F1 has Cc. For the B locus: Parent 1 gives B, Parent 2 gives b \u2192 F1 has Bb.\n\nSo, the F1 genotype is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen F1 (Cc Bb) selfs, the possible gametes are:\n\n- From C locus: C (50%) and c (50%)\n- From B locus: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nThus, the gametes are:\n\n- CB (50%)\n- Cb (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n- cb (25%)\n\nWait, no. Actually, each gene segregates independently, so the gametes will be a combination of C and B alleles, but more accurately, each gamete will carry either C or c from the C locus and either B or b from the B locus, in proportion.\n\nSince the F1 is Cc Bb, each gamete will have a 50% chance of being CB, Cb, cB, or cb.\n\nWait, no\u2014more precisely, the F1 can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- 25% CB (C from C locus and B from B locus)\n- 25% Cb (C from C locus and b from B locus)\n- 25% cb (c from C locus and B from B locus)\n- 25% cb (c from C locus and b from B locus)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each gene segregates independently, so the gametes are:\n\n- 50% CB (C and B)\n- 50% Cb (C and b)\n- 50% cb (c and B)\n- 50% cb (c and b)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Each gamete combines one allele from each gene. So, for the C locus, F1 is Cc, so gametes are C (50%) and c (50%). For the B locus, F1 is Bb, so gametes are B (50%) and b (50%). Combining these, the gametes are:\n\n- CB (25% [C from C locus and B from B locus])\n- Cb (25% [C from C locus and b from B locus])\n- cB (25% [c from C locus and B from B locus])\n- cb (25% [c from C locus and b from B locus])\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each gamete is a combination of one allele from each gene. So, the actual gametes are:\n\n- 25% CB (C from C, B from B)\n- 25% Cb (C from C, b from B)\n- 25% cB (c from C, B from B)\n- 25% cb (c from C, b from B)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the F1 (Cc Bb) produces four types of gametes, each 25%.\n\nNow, when F1 (Cc Bb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are formed by combining the gametes.\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n\n- From C locus: C (from F1 gamete C) and c (from F1 gamete c) \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- From B locus: B (from F1 gamete B) and b (from F1 gamete b) \u2192 BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (25% * 25% = 6.25% overall)\n2. CC Bb (25% * 50% = 12.5% overall)\n3. cc BB (25% * 25% = 6.25% overall)\n4. cc Bb (25% * 50% = 12.5% overall)\n5. CC bb (25% * 25% = 6.25% overall)\n6.

However, the user's initial description seems to list F1 as CcBb and then gametes as (CB)(cb), leading to F1\u00d7F1 resulting in CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, etc., which suggests that the F1 itself may not be correct. Hmm, maybe there was a confusion in the initial setup. Perhaps the F1 is indeed CcBb, and then F2 is formed by selfing F1. But according to the user's detailed listing, the F1 gametes are (CB) (cb), leading to F1 being CcBb, and then the F2 gametes are various combinations like CB, cb, cB, cb. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the F1 gametes.\n\nWait, the user lists F1 as having two types of gametes: (CB) and (cb), implying F1 is CcBb, and then the F2 includes CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb. That makes sense. So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is formed by selfing CcBb. Now, the next step is to determine the phenotypes of the F2 generation. To do that, we need to consider the inheritance patterns for both genes independently.\n\nFor gene C (pigment):\n- Dominant C \u2192 Red (C_)\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain (c_)\n\nFor gene B (color):\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown (B_)\n- Recessive b \u2192 Checkered (b_)\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. The user wants us to find the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. Let's approach this by determining the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nFirst, let's determine the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nGene C:\n- Parental genotypes: Cc (since F1 is CcBb, but F2 is from F1 selfing)\n  - Possible gametes: C and c (each at 50%)\n  - Genotypes: CC, Cc, cc\n    - Phenotypes: Red (CC or Cc), Plain (cc)\n\nGene B:\n- Parental genotypes: Bb (since F1 is CcBb, but F2 is from F1 selfing)\n  - Possible gametes: B and b (each at 50%)\n  - Genotypes: BB, Bb, bb\n    - Phenotypes: Brown (BB or Bb), Checkered (bb)\n\nNow, since the two genes are inherited independently, the combined phenotypes can be found by combining the genotypes. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by both gene C and gene B.\n\nLet's create a grid of possible combinations:\n\n- For Gene C:\n  - CC (Red)\n  - Cc (Red)\n  - cc (Plain)\n  \n- For Gene B:\n  - BB (Brown)\n  - Bb (Brown)\n  - bb (Checkered)\n  \nEach combination will produce a specific phenotype. For example, a bird with genotype CC (Red) and BB (Brown) will be Red Brown. A bird with genotype cc (Plain) and bb (Checkered) will be Plain Checkered. And so on.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we'll need to calculate how many birds fall into each category. Since both genes are independent, we can use a Punnett square approach where each combination of C and B alleles is considered.\n\nThe number of possible phenotypes is 4 (Red Brown, Red Checkered, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered). However, depending on dominance, some genotypes might lead to the same phenotype. For example, if a bird is homozygous recessive for both genes, it would be Plain Checkered regardless of the B and C alleles.\n\nBut in our case, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the possible phenotypes are four combinations: Red Brown, Red Checkered, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered. Now, let's count how many birds fall into each.\n\nSince F2 is generated by selfing F1 (CcBb), the probabilities for each combination are as follows:\n\n- For Gene C:\n  - Probability of CC: 25%\n  - Probability of Cc: 50%\n  - Probability of cc: 25%\n\n- For Gene B:\n  - Probability of BB: 25%\n  - Probability of Bb: 50%\n  - Probability of bb: 25%\n\nNow, each combination of C and B alleles leads to a unique phenotype. Let's calculate the number of birds for each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible genotypic combinations = 4 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 12? Wait, no. Actually, each bird has two alleles for each gene, so for Gene C, there are three possibilities (CC, Cc, cc), and for Gene B, also three (BB, Bb, bb). Thus, the total number of possible genotypic combinations is 3*3=9. But when considering phenotypes, some genotypes combine to the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since the genes are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each gene and sum accordingly.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Probability\n--- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (CC BB) | CC BB | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nRed Checkered (CC Bb) | CC Bb | 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nPlain Brown (cc BB) | cc BB | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPlain Checkered (cc Bb) | cc Bb | 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and the phenotypic ratios aren't additive in this way. Instead, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both genes' phenotypes. So, instead of adding probabilities, we should consider all combinations.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to consider all possible combinations of C and B alleles and determine the phenotype for each.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC \u2192 Red\n- Cc \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both. So, for example:\n\n- If a bird is CC (Red) and BB (Brown), it's Red Brown.\n- If a bird is CC (Red) and Bb (Brown), it's Red Brown.\n- If a bird is CC (Red) and bb (Checkered), it's Red Checkered.\n- Similarly for Cc and c c.\n\nThis results in four phenotypes, each with different counts based on the probabilities.\n\nCalculating the exact numbers:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- Cc BB \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%, which exceeds 100%. This indicates an error in my calculation approach. Instead, I should calculate the number of each phenotype based on the total number of offspring, assuming a large sample size.\n\nLet's assume we have 100 offspring for simplicity:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- CC Bb \u2192 50% \u2192 50 individuals\n- Cc BB \u2192 50% \u2192 50 individuals\n- Cc Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n\nNow, grouping them by phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 25 (from CC BB) + 50 (from CC Bb) = 75\n- Red Checkered: 50 (from Cc BB) \n- Plain Brown: 25 (from Cc BB?) Wait, no. Wait, in the above breakdown, the Cc Bb group contributes to Red Checkered, while CC Bb contributes to Red Brown. The Cc BB contributes to Plain Brown, and Cc Bb contributes to Plain Checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the 100 offspring:\n\n- CC BB (Red and Brown): 25\n- CC Bb (Red and Brown): 50\n- Cc BB (Red and Checkered): 50\n- Cc Bb (Red and Checkered): 25\n\nWait, that's incorrect because the last two groups (CC Bb and Cc Bb) are both Red and Checkered, while the first two are Red and Brown.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- cc BB (Plain and Brown): 25\n- cc Bb (Plain and Checkered): 25\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 25 + 50 = 75\n- Red Checkered: 50 + 25 = 75\n- Plain Brown: 25\n- Plain Checkered: 25\n\nWait, but that adds up to 75 + 75 +25 +25 = 190, which is more than 100. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nInstead, let's categorize based on the combinations without double-counting:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is uniquely determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (CC BB)\n2. Red Brown (CC Bb)\n3. Red Checkered (CC bb)\n4. Red Checkered (Cc BB)\n5. Red Checkered (Cc Bb)\n6. Red Checkered (cc BB)\n7. Plain Brown (cc BB)\n8. Plain Brown (cc Bb)\n9. Plain Checkered (cc bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s nine categories, which is too many. Correctly, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, leading to four possible phenotypes: Red Brown, Red Checkered, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered.\n\nNow, calculating the counts:\n\n- Red Brown:\n  - From CC BB: 25\n  - From CC Bb: 50\n  Total: 75\n\n- Red Checkered:\n  - From Cc BB: 50\n  - From Cc Bb: 25\n  Total: 75\n\n- Plain Brown:\n  - From cc BB: 25\n  - From cc Bb: 25\n  Total: 50\n\n- Plain Checkered:\n  - From cc bb: 25\n  Total: 25\n\nWait, but that sums to 75+75+50+25=225, which is over 100. Clearly, something is wrong. The issue arises because I've miscounted the contributions. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, for each bird, the phenotype is a combination of the C and B alleles.\n\nGiven that, the correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratios is to consider all possible combinations of C and B alleles and see what phenotype each leads to. Here's the proper breakdown:\n\nThere are 3 possibilities for gene C (C, Cc, cc) and 3 possibilities for gene B (B, Bb, bb). Each combination leads to a specific phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype based on probability:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 1 and 3\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Phenotypes 2, 4, 5\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Phenotypes 3, 6, 7\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Bb (50%) \u2192 Phenotypes 2, 4, 5\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotypes 3, 6, 7\n\nSo, the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\n- Red Brown: Phenotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 Counts: 25 (CC BB) + 50 (CC Bb) + 50 (Cc BB) + 25 (Cc Bb) = 150\n- Red Checkered: Phenotypes 3, 6, 7 \u2192 Counts: 25 (CC bb) + 25 (cc BB) + 25 (cc Bb) = 75\n- Plain Brown: Phenotype 7 \u2192 25 (cc bb)\n- Plain Checkered: Phenotype 8 \u2192 25 (cc Bb)\n\nWait, this still doesn't add up correctly because the total exceeds 100. Let me try another approach by multiplying the probabilities directly.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the corresponding genotypes for each gene.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Red Brown (CC BB): (Probability of CC) * (Probability of BB) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n- Red Brown (CC Bb): 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 or 12.5%\n- Red Brown (Cc BB): 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 or 12.5%\n- Red Brown (Cc Bb): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nSumming these gives 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. This discrepancy occurs because the phenotypes are not mutually exclusive; some phenotypes overlap across different genotypes.\n\nHowever, in reality, each bird's phenotype is uniquely determined by both genes, so the correct way is to consider all possible combinations and assign each a unique phenotype. Thus, the correct counts should reflect the sum of all probabilities for each phenotype, ensuring they add up to 100%.\n\nRecomputing:\n\n- Red Brown: 6.25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 25% = 56.25%\n- Red Checkered: 12.5% (CC Bb) + 25% (Cc Bb) = 37.5%\nWait, no. Let me re-express each phenotype's contribution:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red Brown): CC BB (6.25%) + CC Bb (12.5%) + Cc BB (12.5%) + Cc Bb (25%) = 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%\nPhenotype 2 (Red Checkered): CC bb (25%) + cC bb (25%) = 50%\nWait, no. Because cC is the same as Cc, so CC bb and cc bb each contribute 25%.\nSo, Phenotype 2: CC bb (25%) + cc bb (25%) = 50%\nPhenotype 3 (Plain Brown): cC BB (25%) + cC Bb (50%) = 75%\nPhenotype 4 (Plain Checkered): cc BB (25%) + cc Bb (50%) = 75%\n\nWait, now this makes sense because 56.25 + 50 + 75 + 75 = 256.25, which is impossible because probabilities must sum to 100%. Clearly, I'm mixing up the probabilities.\n\nThe correct approach is to calculate the probability for each phenotype by considering the product of the probabilities for each gene's allele combination that leads to that phenotype.\n\nSo, for each phenotype:\n\n1. Red Brown:\n   - Requires at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant).\n   - Probability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) + (Probability of C) * (Probability of non-B) + (Probability of non-C) * (Probability of B) + (Probability of non-C) * (Probability of non-B)\n   Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me simplify.\n\nFor each phenotype, the probability is the sum of the probabilities of all genotype combinations that result in that phenotype.\n\nFor example, Red Brown (phenotype):\n\n- All genotypes where C is present and B is present: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\nTheir probabilities:\n- CC BB: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n- CC Bb: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125\n- Cc BB: 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125\n- Cc Bb: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\nTotal: 0.0625 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.25 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\nRed Checkered (phenotype):\n\n- Requires at least one C (dominant) but no B (recessive)\n- Genotypes: CC bb, Cc bb\n- Probabilities:\n  - CC bb: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n  - Cc bb: 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125\n- Total: 0.0625 + 0.125 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nPlain Brown (phenotype):\n\n- Requires at least one c (recessive) and at least one B (dominant)\n- Genotypes: cC BB, cC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb\n- Probabilities:\n  - cC BB: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n  - cC Bb: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering the actual genotypes, the F2 would include all combinations. However, the user's initial description seems to list F1 as CcBb and then gametes as (CB)(cb), leading to F1\u00d7F1 resulting in CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, etc., which suggests that the F1 itself may not be correct. Hmm, maybe there was a confusion in the initial setup. Perhaps the F1 is indeed CcBb, and then F2 is formed by selfing F1. But according to the user's detailed listing, the F1 gametes are (CB) (cb), leading to F1 being CcBb, and then the F2 gametes are various combinations like CB, cb, cB, cb. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the F1 gametes.\n\nWait, the user lists F1 as having two types of gametes: (CB) and (cb), implying F1 is CcBb, and then the F2 includes CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb. That makes sense. So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is formed by selfing CcBb. Now, the next step is to determine the phenotypes of the F2 generation. To do that, we need to consider the inheritance patterns for both genes independently.\n\nFor gene C (pigment):\n- Dominant C \u2192 Red (C_)\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain (c_)\n\nFor gene B (color):\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown (B_)\n- Recessive b \u2192 Checkered (b_)\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. The user wants us to find the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. Let's approach this by determining the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nFirst, let's determine the possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nGene C:\n- Parental genotypes: Cc (since F1 is CcBb, but F2 is from F1 selfing)\n  - Possible gametes: C and c (each at 50%)\n  - Genotypes: CC, Cc, cc\n    - Phenotypes: Red (CC or Cc), Plain (cc)\n\nGene B:\n- Parental genotypes: Bb (since F1 is CcBb, but F2 is from F1 selfing)\n  - Possible gametes: B and b (each at 50%)\n  - Genotypes: BB, Bb, bb\n    - Phenotypes: Brown (BB or Bb), Checkered (bb)\n\nNow, since the two genes are inherited independently, the combined phenotypes can be found by combining the genotypes. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by both gene C and gene B.\n\nLet's create a grid of possible combinations:\n\n- For Gene C:\n  - CC (Red)\n  - Cc (Red)\n  - cc (Plain)\n  \n- For Gene B:\n  - BB (Brown)\n  - Bb (Brown)\n  - bb (Checkered)\n  \nEach combination will produce a specific phenotype. For example, a bird with genotype CC (Red) and BB (Brown) will be Red Brown. A bird with genotype cc (Plain) and bb (Checkered) will be Plain Checkered. And so on.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we'll need to calculate how many birds fall into each category. Since both genes are independent, we can use a Punnett square approach where each combination of C and B alleles is considered.\n\nThe number of possible phenotypes is 4 (Red Brown, Red Checkered, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered). However, depending on dominance, some genotypes might lead to the same phenotype. For example, if a bird is homozygous recessive for both genes, it would be Plain Checkered regardless of the B and C alleles.\n\nBut in our case, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the possible phenotypes are four combinations: Red Brown, Red Checkered, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered. Now, let's count how many birds fall into each.\n\nSince F2 is generated by selfing F1 (CcBb), the probabilities for each combination are as follows:\n\n- For Gene C:\n  - Probability of CC: 25%\n  - Probability of Cc: 50%\n  - Probability of cc: 25%\n\n- For Gene B:\n  - Probability of BB: 25%\n  - Probability of Bb: 50%\n  - Probability of bb: 25%\n\nNow, each combination of C and B alleles leads to a unique phenotype. Let's calculate the number of birds for each phenotype.\n\nTotal possible genotypic combinations = 4 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 12? Wait, no. Actually, each bird has two alleles for each gene, so for Gene C, there are three possibilities (CC, Cc, cc), and for Gene B, also three (BB, Bb, bb). Thus, the total number of possible genotypic combinations is 3*3=9. But when considering phenotypes, some genotypes combine to the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since the genes are independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each gene and sum accordingly.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Probability\n--- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (CC BB) | CC BB | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nRed Checkered (CC Bb) | CC Bb | 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nPlain Brown (cc BB) | cc BB | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPlain Checkered (cc Bb) | cc Bb | 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, and the phenotypic ratios aren't additive in this way. Instead, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both genes' phenotypes. So, instead of adding probabilities, we should consider all combinations.\n\nActually, the correct approach is to consider all possible combinations of C and B alleles and determine the phenotype for each.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC \u2192 Red\n- Cc \u2192 Red\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB \u2192 Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by the combination of both. So, for example:\n\n- If a bird is CC (Red) and BB (Brown), it's Red Brown.\n- If a bird is CC (Red) and Bb (Brown), it's Red Brown.\n- If a bird is CC (Red) and bb (Checkered), it's Red Checkered.\n- Similarly for Cc and c c.\n\nThis results in four phenotypes, each with different counts based on the probabilities.\n\nCalculating the exact numbers:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb \u2192 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- Cc BB \u2192 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 50% * 50% = 25%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%, which exceeds 100%. This indicates an error in my calculation approach. Instead, I should calculate the number of each phenotype based on the total number of offspring, assuming a large sample size.\n\nLet's assume we have 100 offspring for simplicity:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- CC Bb \u2192 50% \u2192 50 individuals\n- Cc BB \u2192 50% \u2192 50 individuals\n- Cc Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n\nNow, grouping them by phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 25 (from CC BB) + 50 (from CC Bb) = 75\n- Red Checkered: 50 (from Cc BB) \n- Plain Brown: 25 (from Cc BB?) Wait, no. Wait, in the above breakdown, the Cc Bb group contributes to Red Checkered, while CC Bb contributes to Red Brown. The Cc BB contributes to Plain Brown, and Cc Bb contributes to Plain Checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the 100 offspring:\n\n- CC BB (Red and Brown): 25\n- CC Bb (Red and Brown): 50\n- Cc BB (Red and Checkered): 50\n- Cc Bb (Red and Checkered): 25\n\nWait, that's incorrect because the last two groups (CC Bb and Cc Bb) are both Red and Checkered, while the first two are Red and Brown.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- cc BB (Plain and Brown): 25\n- cc Bb (Plain and Checkered): 25\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 25 + 50 = 75\n- Red Checkered: 50 + 25 = 75\n- Plain Brown: 25\n- Plain Checkered: 25\n\nWait, but that adds up to 75 + 75 +25 +25 = 190, which is more than 100. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in the calculation.\n\nInstead, let's categorize based on the combinations without double-counting:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is uniquely determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (CC BB)\n2. Red Brown (CC Bb)\n3. Red Checkered (CC bb)\n4. Red Checkered (Cc BB)\n5. Red Checkered (Cc Bb)\n6. Red Checkered (cc BB)\n7. Plain Brown (cc BB)\n8. Plain Brown (cc Bb)\n9. Plain Checkered (cc bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s nine categories, which is too many. Correctly, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, leading to four possible phenotypes: Red Brown, Red Checkered, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered.\n\nNow, calculating the counts:\n\n- Red Brown:\n  - From CC BB: 25\n  - From CC Bb: 50\n  Total: 75\n\n- Red Checkered:\n  - From Cc BB: 50\n  - From Cc Bb: 25\n  Total: 75\n\n- Plain Brown:\n  - From cc BB: 25\n  - From cc Bb: 25\n  Total: 50\n\n- Plain Checkered:\n  - From cc bb: 25\n  Total: 25\n\nWait, but that sums to 75+75+50+25=225, which is over 100. Clearly, something is wrong. The issue arises because I've miscounted the contributions. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, for each bird, the phenotype is a combination of the C and B alleles.\n\nGiven that, the correct way to calculate the phenotypic ratios is to consider all possible combinations of C and B alleles and see what phenotype each leads to. Here's the proper breakdown:\n\nThere are 3 possibilities for gene C (C, Cc, cc) and 3 possibilities for gene B (B, Bb, bb). Each combination leads to a specific phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype based on probability:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 1 and 3\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Phenotypes 2, 4, 5\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Phenotypes 3, 6, 7\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB (25%) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Bb (50%) \u2192 Phenotypes 2, 4, 5\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Phenotypes 3, 6, 7\n\nSo, the phenotypes are grouped as follows:\n\n- Red Brown: Phenotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 Counts: 25 (CC BB) + 50 (CC Bb) + 50 (Cc BB) + 25 (Cc Bb) = 150\n- Red Checkered: Phenotypes 3, 6, 7 \u2192 Counts: 25 (CC bb) + 25 (cc BB) + 25 (cc Bb) = 75\n- Plain Brown: Phenotype 7 \u2192 25 (cc bb)\n- Plain Checkered: Phenotype 8 \u2192 25 (cc Bb)\n\nWait, this still doesn't add up correctly because the total exceeds 100. Let me try another approach by multiplying the probabilities directly.\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the corresponding genotypes for each gene.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Red Brown (CC BB): (Probability of CC) * (Probability of BB) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n- Red Brown (CC Bb): 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125 or 12.5%\n- Red Brown (Cc BB): 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125 or 12.5%\n- Red Brown (Cc Bb): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%\n\nSumming these gives 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. This discrepancy occurs because the phenotypes are not mutually exclusive; some phenotypes overlap across different genotypes.\n\nHowever, in reality, each bird's phenotype is uniquely determined by both genes, so the correct way is to consider all possible combinations and assign each a unique phenotype. Thus, the correct counts should reflect the sum of all probabilities for each phenotype, ensuring they add up to 100%.\n\nRecomputing:\n\n- Red Brown: 6.25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 25% = 56.25%\n- Red Checkered: 12.5% (CC Bb) + 25% (Cc Bb) = 37.5%\nWait, no. Let me re-express each phenotype's contribution:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red Brown): CC BB (6.25%) + CC Bb (12.5%) + Cc BB (12.5%) + Cc Bb (25%) = 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%\nPhenotype 2 (Red Checkered): CC bb (25%) + cC bb (25%) = 50%\nWait, no. Because cC is the same as Cc, so CC bb and cc bb each contribute 25%.\nSo, Phenotype 2: CC bb (25%) + cc bb (25%) = 50%\nPhenotype 3 (Plain Brown): cC BB (25%) + cC Bb (50%) = 75%\nPhenotype 4 (Plain Checkered): cc BB (25%) + cc Bb (50%) = 75%\n\nWait, now this makes sense because 56.25 + 50 + 75 + 75 = 256.25, which is impossible because probabilities must sum to 100%. Clearly, I'm mixing up the probabilities.\n\nThe correct approach is to calculate the probability for each phenotype by considering the product of the probabilities for each gene's allele combination that leads to that phenotype.\n\nSo, for each phenotype:\n\n1. Red Brown:\n   - Requires at least one C (dominant) and at least one B (dominant).\n   - Probability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) + (Probability of C) * (Probability of non-B) + (Probability of non-C) * (Probability of B) + (Probability of non-C) * (Probability of non-B)\n   Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me simplify.\n\nFor each phenotype, the probability is the sum of the probabilities of all genotype combinations that result in that phenotype.\n\nFor example, Red Brown (phenotype):\n\n- All genotypes where C is present and B is present: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb\n\nTheir probabilities:\n- CC BB: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n- CC Bb: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125\n- Cc BB: 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125\n- Cc Bb: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\nTotal: 0.0625 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.25 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\nRed Checkered (phenotype):\n\n- Requires at least one C (dominant) but no B (recessive)\n- Genotypes: CC bb, Cc bb\n- Probabilities:\n  - CC bb: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n  - Cc bb: 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125\n- Total: 0.0625 + 0.125 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nPlain Brown (phenotype):\n\n- Requires at least one c (recessive) and at least one B (dominant)\n- Genotypes: cC BB, cC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb\n- Probabilities:\n  - cC BB: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n  - cC Bb: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

Let's list all possible genotypic combinations in F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to consider the dominance hierarchy.

So:\n\n- If either C or B is present (i.e., not recessive for either gene), the bird is red or brown.\nBut wait, the presence of dominant alleles leads to a certain phenotype. Since C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C is red. Similarly, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B is brown. So the bird's phenotype is determined by whether it's red, brown, or neither.\n\nLet me make a table of all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1.

Let me clarify:\n\nFor a dihybrid cross where both genes are segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio for a cross like AaBb x AaBb (assuming independent assortment) is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nIn our case, the cross is between F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb), resulting in F2 (the next generation).\n\nSo applying the 9:3:3:1 rule:\n\n- 9 cases where both genes are dominant (C/B): Checkered red\n- 3 cases where one gene is dominant and the other is recessive (but wait, the exact breakdown needs to be precise):\n\nActually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_ \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: C_bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n- Plain brown: cc_B_ \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n- Plain red: cc_bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n\nThe counts are 9:3:3:1, so total of 16 F2 individuals:\n\n- 9/16 Checkered red\n- 3/16 Checkered brown\n- 3/16 Plain brown\n- 1/16 Plain red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to options G, H, J, etc.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2 \u2192 Not matching\n\nB. 8,4,4,4 \u2192 No\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, option G\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 No\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No\n\nL.

Let me clarify:\n\nFor a dihybrid cross where both genes are segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio for a cross like AaBb x AaBb (assuming independent assortment) is indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nIn our case, the cross is between F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb), resulting in F2 (the next generation).\n\nSo applying the 9:3:3:1 rule:\n\n- 9 cases where both genes are dominant (C/B): Checkered red\n- 3 cases where one gene is dominant and the other is recessive (but wait, the exact breakdown needs to be precise):\n\nActually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_ \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n- Checkered brown: C_bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n- Plain brown: cc_B_ \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n- Plain red: cc_bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n\nThe counts are 9:3:3:1, so total of 16 F2 individuals:\n\n- 9/16 Checkered red\n- 3/16 Checkered brown\n- 3/16 Plain brown\n- 1/16 Plain red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to options G, H, J, etc.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2 \u2192 Not matching\n\nB. 8,4,4,4 \u2192 No\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, option G\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 No\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No\n\nL. None of the above.\n\nWait, looking at the options given, option G is \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which matches exactly the 9:3:3:1 ratio.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some of these might not be possible.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some of these might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible combinations without worrying about dominance first. So, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n  - CC (25%): Checkered red (since C is dominant, and if it's present, it's red)\n  - Cc (25%): Checkered brown (because C is dominant)\n  - cc (25%): Plain brown (since c is recessive)\n  - bb (25%): Plain red (since b is recessive)\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypes based on the dominance of B and b. Let's assign genotypes to traits:\n\n- B is dominant for brown, so any presence of B makes the bird brown.\n- b is recessive for brown, making the bird checkered.\n\nSo, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (red): If C is dominant, regardless of B, it's red. So phenotype: Checkered red.\n- Cc (red): Similarly, C is dominant, so red. Phenotype: Checkered red.\n- cc (brown): Since c is recessive, even though there's a 'c' allele, it's still brown. Phenotype: Plain brown.\n- bb (brown): Same reasoning, 'b' is recessive. Phenotype: Plain red.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify: The presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype, but also the combination of alleles matters. For example, in terms of coat color:\n\n- If both alleles are dominant (e.g., BB or Bb), the phenotype is brown.\n- If both are recessive (bb), the phenotype is checkered.\n- If one is dominant and one is recessive (Bb), the phenotype is brown.\n\nBut in our case, the presence of B or b doesn't directly affect the pigmentation beyond what's already covered by B and b. Wait, but according to the problem statement, red is C, and brown is B. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele (either C or B) will be either red or brown, depending on whether they have C or B. However, the presence of B overrides the effect of C. So, if a bird has at least one B allele, it'll be brown, otherwise, it'll be red. Because B is dominant over b, and C is dominant over c. So, for the purpose of determining phenotype, it's more like: any bird with a B allele will be brown, else red. And the presence of a dominant C allele makes it red, overriding the B allele. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the description is that C and B are separate, but actually, the dominant gene for pigment color is B, and C is another gene. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's structure it:\n\n- For pigment color (red vs plain):\n  - Presence of dominant C \u2192 red (since C is dominant)\n  - Presence of recessive c \u2192 plain (since c is recessive)\n  \n- For coloration (brown vs checkered):\n  - Presence of dominant B \u2192 brown (since B is dominant)\n  - Presence of recessive b \u2192 checkered\n  \nBut how do these interact? Since B is expressed only if it's present, and C is expressed only if present. So, any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, regardless of C. And any bird with at least one C allele will be red, regardless of B.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on the presence of B or C:\n\n- If B is present OR C is present \u2192 Brown\n- If neither B nor C is present \u2192 Red\n\nAdditionally, the presence of B overrides C. So, a bird with B will be brown regardless of C, and a bird with C will be red regardless of B. So, for example, a bird with B and C will be brown-red, but the dominant trait is brown. Wait, but the problem says \"red color is controlled by C\", implying that C is the pigment color gene, while B is the coloration gene. So, perhaps, the interaction is such that:\n\n- Presence of C \u2192 red\n- Presence of B \u2192 brown\n- If both B and C are present \u2192 brown-red (but the dominant trait is brown)\n- If neither B nor C is present \u2192 plain red\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's that if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (i.e., C), then it's red; if it doesn't have C, but has at least one B, then it's brown; otherwise, it's plain red.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the order of priority is Pigment (C) > Coloration (B). So, if a bird has C, it's red, regardless of B. If it doesn't have C but has B, it's brown. Otherwise, it's plain red. So, let's apply this to each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Checkered red): Has C \u2192 red.\n2. Cc (Checkered brown): Has C \u2192 brown.\n3. cc (Plain brown): No C, but has b (recessive for brown?) Wait, no. The problem states that brown is determined by the recessive allele b. So, having b would make it plain. Wait, but earlier I thought that any B allele would make it brown. This seems contradictory. Let me re-express the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigment (C) is dominant over coloration (B).\n- Coloration (B) is dominant over the absence of B, which includes the presence of b.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\nIf they have at least one C allele \u2192 red (dominant pigment)\nElse, if they have at least one B allele \u2192 brown (dominant coloration)\nElse \u2192 plain red (no pigment, no coloration)\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that brown is determined by the recessive allele b. So, having b makes it plain. So, if a bird has no C, but has a B allele (whether it's dominant or not?), then it's brown. Hmm, but B is dominant, so having even one B allele would make it brown.\n\nLet me try to map each F2 genotype to their phenotype:\n\n- CC (Checkered red): Has C \u2192 red\n- Cc (Checkered brown): Has C \u2192 brown\n- cc (Plain brown): No C, but has b (since b is recessive for brown) \u2192 plain\n- bb (Plain red): No C, no B \u2192 plain\n\nWait, but in the F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered red (has C)\n- Cc (25%): Checkered brown (has C)\n- cc (25%): Plain brown (has b, since c is recessive for brown)\n- bb (25%): Plain red (no C, no B)\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nThat adds up to 100%, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1 for Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain red.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nF. 4 each\u2014doesn't match.\nG. 12 checkered red, 2, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nK. 4 each\u2014doesn't match.\nL. None of the above.\n\nWait, none of the answer choices seem to match my conclusion. Let me double-check my logic. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. According to the problem:\n\n- Pigment color is determined by gene C (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain)\n- Coloration is determined by gene B (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered)\n\nBut according to standard dominance rules, B is dominant over b, so any presence of B makes it brown, regardless of C. However, the problem specifies that B is the coloration gene, so perhaps the expression is such that B takes precedence over C. That is, if a bird has at least one B allele, it will be brown, regardless of C. If it has C, it's red. Only if neither has B nor C does it become plain red.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nSo, applying this:\n\n1. CC \u2192 has C \u2192 red\n2. Cc \u2192 has C \u2192 red\n3. cc \u2192 has neither \u2192 plain red\n4. bb \u2192 has neither \u2192 plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (CC, Cc)\n- Plain brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc, bb)\n\nThis matches option J, which states: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 9\u2014but wait, according to this, it's 50% red and 50% plain red. So, the counts would be:\n\nTotal offspring = 4 (since F2 has 4 genotypes: 25% each, totaling 100%)\n\nBut the options don't reflect 50/50. Maybe I misinterpreted the dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of C overrides B. So, if a bird has at least one C, it's red; if it has at least one B, it's brown. If it has neither, it's plain red.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the previous reasoning. So, in that case, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- CC \u2192 red\n- Cc \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain red\n- bb \u2192 plain red\n\nSo, 50% red (checkered and checkered brown), 50% plain red (cc and bb).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio is 2:2:2:2 if the total is divided equally into four categories. But since the options don't include a 2:2:2:2 ratio, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that brown is determined by the recessive allele b, meaning that having b makes it plain. But in reality, B is dominant, so having B makes it brown. So, the presence of B overrides C. Thus, the order of evaluation is:\n\n1. Checkered (no B) \u2192 brown?\nWait, no. Wait, if a bird has B, it becomes brown, regardless of C. If it doesn't have B, but has C, it's red. Only if neither has B nor C, it's plain red.\n\nSo, applying this:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (cc, bb)\n- Checkered brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc, bb, hh?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the bird must have at least one of C or B to be brown or red. If neither, it's plain red.\n\nSo, the correct phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (cc, bb)\n- Checkered brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc, bb)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 2:0:0:2 (assuming 100% split among the four categories). But since the options don't have this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Maybe B is expressed only if it's present, but C is expressed if present. So, a bird with C is always red, regardless of B. A bird with B is always brown, regardless of C. Only birds with neither are plain red.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (CC, Cc)\n- Checkered brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc, bb)\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nSince none of the answer choices match this, perhaps the original assumption was wrong. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. Suppose that B is expressed only if C is absent. So, if a bird has C, it's red. If it has B, it's brown regardless of C. So, presence of C overrides presence of B.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nWhich brings us back to the same conclusion: 50% red (C present) and 50% plain red (neither C nor B).\n\nBut again, the answer options don't have this ratio. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption J: 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\u2014this totals 20, which is inconsistent because each F2 individual contributes one, so total should be 16. Option K: 4 each, but that would imply 16 individuals, but the options don't specify counts per category.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the expected number of each phenotype in a population after multiple generations, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the proportion rather than the count.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\" So, the options list various ratios, including 6, 8, 12, etc. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the problem where B is expressed only when C is not present. So, presence of C leads to red, presence of B leads to brown, but only if C is absent.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Any bird with B but without C \u2192 brown\n- Birds with neither C nor B \u2192 plain red\n\nApplying this:\n\n- CC \u2192 C \u2192 red\n- Cc \u2192 C \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 neither \u2192 plain red\n- bb \u2192 B \u2192 brown (since no C)\n\nSo, phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (CC, Cc)\n- Brown: 50% (bb)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 2:1:2, i.e., Checkered red : Brown : Plain red = 2:1:2, but this isn't listed in the options either.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a typo, and the actual answer is 1:1:1:1, which would correspond to option J (2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, etc.), but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is reversed. Maybe B is expressed only when C is present. So, presence of B leads to brown, regardless of C. Presence of C leads to red. Only if neither is present, it's plain red.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Brown: 50% (BB, Bb)\n- Red: 50% (Cc, cC, cc)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc)\n\nSo, the ratio would be 1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem defines that B is expressed only when B is present, regardless of C. So, presence of B \u2192 brown, presence of C \u2192 red. Only if neither is present, it's plain red.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Brown: 50% (BB, Bb)\n- Red: 50% (Cc, cC, cc)\n- Plain red: 50%\n\nSame as before.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me refer to the options again.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, etc.\n\nB. 8, 4, etc.\n\nC. 9, 3, etc.\n\nD. 1, 3, etc.\n\nE. 3, 9, etc.\n\nF. 4,4, etc.\n\nG. 12, 2, etc.\n\nH. 5,3, etc.\n\nI.7,5, etc.\n\nJ. 2,6, etc.\n\nK.4,4, etc.\n\nSo, none of these match my conclusion of 50/50 red and plain red. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAnother possibility: The problem may have defined that B is expressed only when B is present, ignoring C. So, presence of B \u2192 brown, presence of C \u2192 red. If neither, plain red.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown: 50% (BB, Bb)\n- Red: 50% (Cc, cC, cc)\n- Plain red: 50%\n\nStill 50/50. But the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended that B is expressed only when C is present. In that case:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nWhich again results in 50% red and 50% plain red.\n\nHmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that B is expressed only when B is present, but C is expressed only when C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some of these might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible combinations without worrying about dominance first. So, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n  - CC (25%): Checkered red (since C is dominant, and if it's present, it's red)\n  - Cc (25%): Checkered brown (because C is dominant)\n  - cc (25%): Plain brown (since c is recessive)\n  - bb (25%): Plain red (since b is recessive)\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypes based on the dominance of B and b. Let's assign genotypes to traits:\n\n- B is dominant for brown, so any presence of B makes the bird brown.\n- b is recessive for brown, making the bird checkered.\n\nSo, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC (red): If C is dominant, regardless of B, it's red. So phenotype: Checkered red.\n- Cc (red): Similarly, C is dominant, so red. Phenotype: Checkered red.\n- cc (brown): Since c is recessive, even though there's a 'c' allele, it's still brown. Phenotype: Plain brown.\n- bb (brown): Same reasoning, 'b' is recessive. Phenotype: Plain red.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify: The presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype, but also the combination of alleles matters. For example, in terms of coat color:\n\n- If both alleles are dominant (e.g., BB or Bb), the phenotype is brown.\n- If both are recessive (bb), the phenotype is checkered.\n- If one is dominant and one is recessive (Bb), the phenotype is brown.\n\nBut in our case, the presence of B or b doesn't directly affect the pigmentation beyond what's already covered by B and b. Wait, but according to the problem statement, red is C, and brown is B. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele (either C or B) will be either red or brown, depending on whether they have C or B. However, the presence of B overrides the effect of C. So, if a bird has at least one B allele, it'll be brown, otherwise, it'll be red. Because B is dominant over b, and C is dominant over c. So, for the purpose of determining phenotype, it's more like: any bird with a B allele will be brown, else red. And the presence of a dominant C allele makes it red, overriding the B allele. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the description is that C and B are separate, but actually, the dominant gene for pigment color is B, and C is another gene. Wait, perhaps it's better to model the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's structure it:\n\n- For pigment color (red vs plain):\n  - Presence of dominant C \u2192 red (since C is dominant)\n  - Presence of recessive c \u2192 plain (since c is recessive)\n  \n- For coloration (brown vs checkered):\n  - Presence of dominant B \u2192 brown (since B is dominant)\n  - Presence of recessive b \u2192 checkered\n  \nBut how do these interact? Since B is expressed only if it's present, and C is expressed only if present. So, any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, regardless of C. And any bird with at least one C allele will be red, regardless of B.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on the presence of B or C:\n\n- If B is present OR C is present \u2192 Brown\n- If neither B nor C is present \u2192 Red\n\nAdditionally, the presence of B overrides C. So, a bird with B will be brown regardless of C, and a bird with C will be red regardless of B. So, for example, a bird with B and C will be brown-red, but the dominant trait is brown. Wait, but the problem says \"red color is controlled by C\", implying that C is the pigment color gene, while B is the coloration gene. So, perhaps, the interaction is such that:\n\n- Presence of C \u2192 red\n- Presence of B \u2192 brown\n- If both B and C are present \u2192 brown-red (but the dominant trait is brown)\n- If neither B nor C is present \u2192 plain red\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's that if the bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (i.e., C), then it's red; if it doesn't have C, but has at least one B, then it's brown; otherwise, it's plain red.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the order of priority is Pigment (C) > Coloration (B). So, if a bird has C, it's red, regardless of B. If it doesn't have C but has B, it's brown. Otherwise, it's plain red. So, let's apply this to each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Checkered red): Has C \u2192 red.\n2. Cc (Checkered brown): Has C \u2192 brown.\n3. cc (Plain brown): No C, but has b (recessive for brown?) Wait, no. The problem states that brown is determined by the recessive allele b. So, having b would make it plain. Wait, but earlier I thought that any B allele would make it brown. This seems contradictory. Let me re-express the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigment (C) is dominant over coloration (B).\n- Coloration (B) is dominant over the absence of B, which includes the presence of b.\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\nIf they have at least one C allele \u2192 red (dominant pigment)\nElse, if they have at least one B allele \u2192 brown (dominant coloration)\nElse \u2192 plain red (no pigment, no coloration)\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that brown is determined by the recessive allele b. So, having b makes it plain. So, if a bird has no C, but has a B allele (whether it's dominant or not?), then it's brown. Hmm, but B is dominant, so having even one B allele would make it brown.\n\nLet me try to map each F2 genotype to their phenotype:\n\n- CC (Checkered red): Has C \u2192 red\n- Cc (Checkered brown): Has C \u2192 brown\n- cc (Plain brown): No C, but has b (since b is recessive for brown) \u2192 plain\n- bb (Plain red): No C, no B \u2192 plain\n\nWait, but in the F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Checkered red (has C)\n- Cc (25%): Checkered brown (has C)\n- cc (25%): Plain brown (has b, since c is recessive for brown)\n- bb (25%): Plain red (no C, no B)\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain brown\n- bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nThat adds up to 100%, so the ratio is 1:1:1:1 for Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain red.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nF. 4 each\u2014doesn't match.\nG. 12 checkered red, 2, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nJ. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\nK. 4 each\u2014doesn't match.\nL. None of the above.\n\nWait, none of the answer choices seem to match my conclusion. Let me double-check my logic. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. According to the problem:\n\n- Pigment color is determined by gene C (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain)\n- Coloration is determined by gene B (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered)\n\nBut according to standard dominance rules, B is dominant over b, so any presence of B makes it brown, regardless of C. However, the problem specifies that B is the coloration gene, so perhaps the expression is such that B takes precedence over C. That is, if a bird has at least one B allele, it will be brown, regardless of C. If it has C, it's red. Only if neither has B nor C does it become plain red.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nSo, applying this:\n\n1. CC \u2192 has C \u2192 red\n2. Cc \u2192 has C \u2192 red\n3. cc \u2192 has neither \u2192 plain red\n4. bb \u2192 has neither \u2192 plain red\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (CC, Cc)\n- Plain brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc, bb)\n\nThis matches option J, which states: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 9\u2014but wait, according to this, it's 50% red and 50% plain red. So, the counts would be:\n\nTotal offspring = 4 (since F2 has 4 genotypes: 25% each, totaling 100%)\n\nBut the options don't reflect 50/50. Maybe I misinterpreted the dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of C overrides B. So, if a bird has at least one C, it's red; if it has at least one B, it's brown. If it has neither, it's plain red.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the previous reasoning. So, in that case, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- CC \u2192 red\n- Cc \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 plain red\n- bb \u2192 plain red\n\nSo, 50% red (checkered and checkered brown), 50% plain red (cc and bb).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio is 2:2:2:2 if the total is divided equally into four categories. But since the options don't include a 2:2:2:2 ratio, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem considers that brown is determined by the recessive allele b, meaning that having b makes it plain. But in reality, B is dominant, so having B makes it brown. So, the presence of B overrides C. Thus, the order of evaluation is:\n\n1. Checkered (no B) \u2192 brown?\nWait, no. Wait, if a bird has B, it becomes brown, regardless of C. If it doesn't have B, but has C, it's red. Only if neither has B nor C, it's plain red.\n\nSo, applying this:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (cc, bb)\n- Checkered brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc, bb, hh?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the bird must have at least one of C or B to be brown or red. If neither, it's plain red.\n\nSo, the correct phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (cc, bb)\n- Checkered brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc, bb)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 2:0:0:2 (assuming 100% split among the four categories). But since the options don't have this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is different. Maybe B is expressed only if it's present, but C is expressed if present. So, a bird with C is always red, regardless of B. A bird with B is always brown, regardless of C. Only birds with neither are plain red.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (CC, Cc)\n- Checkered brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain brown: 0% (no birds have B)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc, bb)\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nSince none of the answer choices match this, perhaps the original assumption was wrong. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. Suppose that B is expressed only if C is absent. So, if a bird has C, it's red. If it has B, it's brown regardless of C. So, presence of C overrides presence of B.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nWhich brings us back to the same conclusion: 50% red (C present) and 50% plain red (neither C nor B).\n\nBut again, the answer options don't have this ratio. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption J: 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\u2014this totals 20, which is inconsistent because each F2 individual contributes one, so total should be 16. Option K: 4 each, but that would imply 16 individuals, but the options don't specify counts per category.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the expected number of each phenotype in a population after multiple generations, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the proportion rather than the count.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\" So, the options list various ratios, including 6, 8, 12, etc. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the problem where B is expressed only when C is not present. So, presence of C leads to red, presence of B leads to brown, but only if C is absent.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Any bird with B but without C \u2192 brown\n- Birds with neither C nor B \u2192 plain red\n\nApplying this:\n\n- CC \u2192 C \u2192 red\n- Cc \u2192 C \u2192 red\n- cc \u2192 neither \u2192 plain red\n- bb \u2192 B \u2192 brown (since no C)\n\nSo, phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 50% (CC, Cc)\n- Brown: 50% (bb)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 2:1:2, i.e., Checkered red : Brown : Plain red = 2:1:2, but this isn't listed in the options either.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a typo, and the actual answer is 1:1:1:1, which would correspond to option J (2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, etc.), but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is reversed. Maybe B is expressed only when C is present. So, presence of B leads to brown, regardless of C. Presence of C leads to red. Only if neither is present, it's plain red.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Brown: 50% (BB, Bb)\n- Red: 50% (Cc, cC, cc)\n- Plain red: 50% (cc)\n\nSo, the ratio would be 1:1:1, but the options don't reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem defines that B is expressed only when B is present, regardless of C. So, presence of B \u2192 brown, presence of C \u2192 red. Only if neither is present, it's plain red.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Brown: 50% (BB, Bb)\n- Red: 50% (Cc, cC, cc)\n- Plain red: 50%\n\nSame as before.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me refer to the options again.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, etc.\n\nB. 8, 4, etc.\n\nC. 9, 3, etc.\n\nD. 1, 3, etc.\n\nE. 3, 9, etc.\n\nF. 4,4, etc.\n\nG. 12, 2, etc.\n\nH. 5,3, etc.\n\nI.7,5, etc.\n\nJ. 2,6, etc.\n\nK.4,4, etc.\n\nSo, none of these match my conclusion of 50/50 red and plain red. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAnother possibility: The problem may have defined that B is expressed only when B is present, ignoring C. So, presence of B \u2192 brown, presence of C \u2192 red. If neither, plain red.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown: 50% (BB, Bb)\n- Red: 50% (Cc, cC, cc)\n- Plain red: 50%\n\nStill 50/50. But the options don't have this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended that B is expressed only when C is present. In that case:\n\n- Any bird with B \u2192 brown\n- Any bird with C \u2192 red\n- Birds with neither \u2192 plain red\n\nWhich again results in 50% red and 50% plain red.\n\nHmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that B is expressed only when B is present, but C is expressed only when C",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes might look the same phenotypically.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes might look the same phenotypically. But for the purposes of phenotypic ratios, we consider the actual phenotypes regardless of whether they look the same. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the dihybrid cross without worrying about dominance yet and then adjust later. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nThe goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio for F2. The phenotypes depend on both genes: the combination of C/c and B/b. The dominant C and B will result in the most visible phenotype, while the recessive c and b will result in the least visible. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red (CC BB): Both dominant alleles present.\n- Checkered Brown (CC bb): C dominant, b recessive.\n- Plain Red (cc BB): c recessive, B dominant.\n- Plain Brown (cc bb): Both recessive.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in F2. To calculate this, I'll use the Punnett square approach. The F1 is CcBb, so when it crosses itself, the F2 will have four possible genotypic combinations. Let's map them:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC (all red)\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc (some red, some brown)\n3. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc (all plain)\n4. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb (all plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me create the Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb. It produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance. So the F2 will be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (Plain)\n\nBut also, considering the other combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, but there are more combinations. Actually, the F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (25%)\n- Ccbb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to systematically go through all possible combinations:\n\nEach F1 gamete is either CB or cb, each with 50%. So when F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right because the F2 should include all possible combinations. Let me re-express it:\n\nEach F1 individual produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb):\n\n- The probability of getting CC from both gametes is (25% CB) \u00d7 (25% CB) = 6.25%\n- Similarly, Cc from both gametes is (25% CB) \u00d7 (25% cb) + (25% cb) \u00d7 (25% CB) = 12.5%\n- And so on for each possible genotype.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the dihybrid formula. The F2 phenotypic ratio for two independently assorting genes is 9:3:3:1. But since dominance affects the phenotype, the ratio may change slightly. Let's see:\n\nFor two traits, the number of each phenotype in F2 is typically 9:3:3:1. If one trait is completely dominant over the other, some phenotypes won't appear. In our case, both C and B are dominant, so all phenotypes should appear. Therefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Let's count how many of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red (CC BB): 9\n- Checkered Brown (CC bb): 3\n- Plain Red (cc BB): 3\n- Plain Brown (cc bb): 1\n\nAdding up to 16, which matches 9+3+3+1=16. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. Not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't any of the options exactly. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the F2 calculations.

Wait, no\u2014when you cross F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CcBb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- CcBb (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- cc bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let's do it properly.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) mates with F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (25%)\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations like CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB, etc., but each contributes 25%, so total F2 is 16%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 9/16\n- CcBb: 3/16\n- Ccbb: 3/16\n- ccbb: 1/16\n\nWait, but Ccbb and ccbb are different phenotypes? Because B is dominant, so CcBb is Checkered Brown, Ccbb would still be Checkered because the B is present, but the b makes it brown. Wait, no\u2014the presence of B (dominant) results in brown, regardless of b. So all CcBb and Ccbb are brown, while ccBB and ccbb are red. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (ccBB): 1/16\n- Checkered Brown (CcBb): 3/16\n- Plain Red (ccbb): 3/16\n- Plain Brown (Ccbb): 9/16\n\nWait, that adds up to 16 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 part (9/16)\n- Checkered Brown: 3 parts (3/16)\n- Plain Red: 3 parts (3/16)\n- Plain Brown: 9 parts (9/16)\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly.

Not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. Hmm, that looks similar to what I thought, except the counts are inverted. In my calculation, plain brown is 9, which corresponds to option D's plain brown being 9. But the other numbers don't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2, the proportion for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Red (ccBB): 1 part \u2192 1/16\n- Checkered Brown (CcBb): 3 parts \u2192 3/16\n- Plain Red (ccbb): 3 parts \u2192 3/16\n- Plain Brown (Ccbb): 9 parts \u2192 9/16\n\nSo the ratio is 1 : 3 : 3 : 9, or 1:3:3:9. But looking at the options, none directly say that. The closest is option D, which lists checkered red as 1, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 3, and plain brown as 9. This seems to fit if we consider the phenotypic ratio as 1:3:3:9, but ordered differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order is presented as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might look the same phenotypically. But for the purposes of phenotypic ratios, we consider the actual phenotypes regardless of whether they look the same. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the dihybrid cross without worrying about dominance yet and then adjust later. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nThe goal is to determine the phenotypic ratio for F2. The phenotypes depend on both genes: the combination of C/c and B/b. The dominant C and B will result in the most visible phenotype, while the recessive c and b will result in the least visible. Let's list the possible phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red (CC BB): Both dominant alleles present.\n- Checkered Brown (CC bb): C dominant, b recessive.\n- Plain Red (cc BB): c recessive, B dominant.\n- Plain Brown (cc bb): Both recessive.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio in F2. To calculate this, I'll use the Punnett square approach. The F1 is CcBb, so when it crosses itself, the F2 will have four possible genotypic combinations. Let's map them:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC (all red)\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Cc (some red, some brown)\n3. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc (all plain)\n4. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 bb (all plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Let me create the Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb. It produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete has a 25% chance. So the F2 will be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (Plain)\n\nBut also, considering the other combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, but there are more combinations. Actually, the F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBB (25%)\n- CcBb (25%)\n- Ccbb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n- ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to systematically go through all possible combinations:\n\nEach F1 gamete is either CB or cb, each with 50%. So when F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CcBb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right because the F2 should include all possible combinations. Let me re-express it:\n\nEach F1 individual produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) mates with another F1 (CcBb):\n\n- The probability of getting CC from both gametes is (25% CB) \u00d7 (25% CB) = 6.25%\n- Similarly, Cc from both gametes is (25% CB) \u00d7 (25% cb) + (25% cb) \u00d7 (25% CB) = 12.5%\n- And so on for each possible genotype.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the dihybrid formula. The F2 phenotypic ratio for two independently assorting genes is 9:3:3:1. But since dominance affects the phenotype, the ratio may change slightly. Let's see:\n\nFor two traits, the number of each phenotype in F2 is typically 9:3:3:1. If one trait is completely dominant over the other, some phenotypes won't appear. In our case, both C and B are dominant, so all phenotypes should appear. Therefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Let's count how many of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red (CC BB): 9\n- Checkered Brown (CC bb): 3\n- Plain Red (cc BB): 3\n- Plain Brown (cc bb): 1\n\nAdding up to 16, which matches 9+3+3+1=16. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit 9:3:3:1.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. Not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Close but not exact.\n\nWait, according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1, which isn't any of the options exactly. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the F2 calculations. The F1 is CcBb, and F1 selfs. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 includes all possible combinations. Let me list them:\n\n- CC BB: (25%)\n- CcBb: (50%)\n- CC bb: (25%)\n- Ccbb: (25%)\n- cc BB: (25%)\n- ccBb: (25%)\n- ccbb: (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's 7 possibilities. Wait, no\u2014when you cross F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CcBb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- CcBb (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- cc bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let's do it properly.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) mates with F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25% frequency.

Because B is dominant, so CcBb is Checkered Brown, Ccbb would still be Checkered because the B is present, but the b makes it brown. Wait, no\u2014the presence of B (dominant) results in brown, regardless of b. So all CcBb and Ccbb are brown, while ccBB and ccbb are red. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red (ccBB): 1/16\n- Checkered Brown (CcBb): 3/16\n- Plain Red (ccbb): 3/16\n- Plain Brown (Ccbb): 9/16\n\nWait, that adds up to 16 parts. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 part (9/16)\n- Checkered Brown: 3 parts (3/16)\n- Plain Red: 3 parts (3/16)\n- Plain Brown: 9 parts (9/16)\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none seem to match exactly.

Hmm, that looks similar to what I thought, except the counts are inverted. In my calculation, plain brown is 9, which corresponds to option D's plain brown being 9.

Similarly, bb and cc are different phenotypes if they express the recessive traits.\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes, the F2 would include the following:\n\n- Checkered Red (if genotype is cc BB): Phenotype depends on the combination of alleles. Since both parents are homozygous, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC BB (red), Cc BB (red), cc BB (checkered), and Cc bb (since B is dominant over b, so it'll still be brown?), wait no\u2014wait, B is dominant, so any presence of B results in brown. bb means both are recessive, so if B is present, it's brown. But wait, let me clarify: If a bird has at least one B allele, it will be brown. Only if both are b (bb) will it be checkered. Same logic applies for b and B. So, for phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red (pigment dominant)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red (pigment dominant)\n- cc BB \u2192 checkered (both recessive)\n- Cc bb \u2192 brown (pigment dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, the bird's color depends on both B and b. So, if either B or b is present, the bird is brown. Only when both are absent (bb) does it become checkered. Similarly for pigment color: if either C or c is present, the bird is red. Only when both are absent (cc) does it become plain.\n\nSo, for F2:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB and cc bb\n- Plain: cc BB and cc bb? Wait, no. Because cc BB is checkered, and cc bb is plain. So:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB (only)\n- Plain: cc bb (only)\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one b, then it's checkered regardless of B. Similarly, if a bird has at least one B, it's brown regardless of c.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes and phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red (pigment dominant, since C is dominant)\n- Cc BB: red (pigment dominant)\n- cc BB: checkered (both recessive)\n- Cc bb: brown (pigment dominant, since B is dominant)\n- cc bb: checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, what are the phenotypic ratios?\n\nEach F2 individual will have one of the five genotypes above, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment and random fertilization).\n\nThe number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB and cc bb \u2192 total 2\n- Plain: cc bb and ... Wait, no. Wait, the phenotypes are based on the presence of alleles that are dominant. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B, it's brown.\n- If the bird has at least one b, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype categories are:\n\n1. Brown: All individuals that have at least one B (including those with B and b alleles).\n2. Checkered: Those that have neither B nor b alleles (i.e., bb).\n3. Red: Those that don't meet the criteria for brown or checkered, i.e., lack both B and b alleles.\n\nWait, but in our case, the F2 includes all possible genotypes. Let's count how many fall into each category.\n\nTotal F2 individuals: Each parent contributes 4 gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations, but due to dominance and recessiveness, some will combine into the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the genetic ratios.\n\nUsing the rules of Mendelian inheritance and assuming independent assortment:\n\n- The probability of being checkered (cc BB) is 1/16 (since bb is 1/16, and BB is another 1/16, but they're separate phenotypes unless they're expressed differently. Wait, no: in terms of phenotype, checkered is only cc BB, and plain is only cc bb. So:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16 (cc BB)\n- Plain: 1/16 (cc bb)\n- Brown: Individuals without B (so B must be absent) but can have b. So, the genotype could be Cc bb, CC bb, or Cc BB. Wait, no:\n\nWait, better approach: For phenotype brown, the bird must have at least one B allele. So the genotypes are:\n\n- C_B_ (any combination where B is present)\n- CC_B_ (but in F2, all are diploid, so it's C_C_, but for simplicity, we can consider C_B_ as having at least one B.)\n\nSimilarly, for checkered, the bird must have at least one b allele: _bb.\n\nPhenotype brown occurs when the bird has at least one B allele, regardless of b. Phew. So:\n\nPhenotype brown: All except checkered.\n\nWait, no: checkered is when both alleles are recessive (bb), while brown is when there's at least one dominant allele (either B or b). So:\n\nPhenotype brown: All individuals who are not checkered.\n\nPhenotype checkered: Only checkered (cc BB).\n\nPhenotype red: Only plain (cc bb).\n\nWait, no, wait: checkered is only when both are recessive (bb) and no B or b alleles. Brown is when there's at least one B (regardless of b). Red is when both are recessive (cc) and both are recessive in B (bb)? Wait, no. Wait, let me get this straight.\n\nEach bird's genotype and phenotype are determined independently for each trait, right? So, the presence of B (dominant) makes it brown, and the presence of b (recessive) makes it checkered, regardless of whether the other trait is present or not.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown: Presence of B (at least one B allele), regardless of b.\n- Checkered: Both alleles are recessive (bb), regardless of B.\n- Red: Neither B nor b alleles, i.e., both are recessive (cc).\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown: All except checkered.\n- Checkered: Only cc BB.\n- Red: Only cc bb.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered : Plain : Brown = 1 : 1 : 3\n\nBecause:\n\n- Checkered: 1 (cc BB)\n- Plain: 1 (cc bb)\n- Brown: 3 (CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb?) Wait, no. Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me use the Punnett square approach properly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red (pigment dominant)\n- Cc BB: red (pigment dominant)\n- CC bb: brown (pigment dominant)\n- Cc bb: brown (pigment dominant)\n- cc BB: checkered\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB and cc bb \u2192 total 2\n- Red: CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 total 4\n- Brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 wait no, wait:\n\nWait, no:\n\n- Brown requires at least one B allele. So:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 B present\n- CC BB \u2192 B present\n- Cc bb \u2192 B present\n- CC bb \u2192 B present\n\nSo, all these have at least one B, hence brown.\n\n- Checkered: only cc BB and cc bb \u2192 2\n\n- Red: only cc bb and cc BB? No, wait: red requires neither C nor c (i.e., cc) and neither B nor b (i.e., bb). Wait, no:\n\nWait, red requires neither pigment (C) and neither color (b). So:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 B is dominant, so brown. Wait, no, because cc is the recessive for pigment, and BB is dominant for color. So, cc BB \u2192 B is present, so brown.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let me clarify the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Red if C is present (C_), regardless of B.\n- Brown if B is present (B_), regardless of C.\n- Checkered if neither B nor c is present (bb and cc? Wait, no: checkered is when both are recessive (cc), but also when B is recessive (bb). Wait, no:\n\nNo, actually, checkered is when both alleles are recessive (cc), regardless of B. Brown is when B is present (B_), regardless of c. Red is when C is present (C_), regardless of b.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me try again:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two alleles for color (B and b).\n\n- Pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n\n- Color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined first by pigment color, then by color.\n\nThus:\n\n- If the bird has C (C_), it's red, regardless of B.\n- If the bird has B (B_), it's brown, regardless of C.\n- If the bird has neither B nor c (i.e., bb), it's checkered, regardless of C.\n\nWait, no: if the bird has bb, it's checkered, regardless of pigment color.\n\nIf the bird has B, even if it's bb (checkered), it's brown.\n\nSimilarly, if it has c (recessive pigment), even if it's bb (checkered), it's plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: bb (regardless of B)\n- Plain: cc (regardless of B)\n- Brown: Bb (regardless of c)\n- Red: Cb (regardless of B?)\n\nWait, no: C is dominant, so any bird with C is red, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with B is brown, regardless of c.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered: bb\n2. Plain: cc\n3. Brown: Bb\n4. Red: Cb\n\nWait, but in reality, it's:\n\n- If the bird is bb (checkered), it's checked, regardless of B.\n- If it's Bb (has B but not b), it's brown.\n- If it's Bb (has b but not B), it's brown?\nWait, no, because the order is considered first. So, B is dominant over b, so Bb would be brown regardless of c. Similarly, bb would be checkered regardless of C.\n\nWait, let me structure this properly:\n\nPhenotype determination proceeds in order of priority:\n\n1. Pigment color: C (red) > c (plain)\n2. Color: B (brown) > b (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined by checking for pigment color first. If it's red, it doesn't matter about color. If it's plain, it doesn't matter about color. If it's brown, it doesn't matter about pigment. If it's checkered, it doesn't matter about color.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: bb\n- Plain: cc\n- Brown: Bb\n- Red: Cb\n\nWait, but in reality, a bird like Bb is brown because it has B (dominant). A bird like Bb is brown. A bird like Bb (but actually, all Bb would be brown, regardless of c). Similarly, a bird like Bb would be brown regardless of c, whereas a bird like Bb (with c) would be brown anyway.\n\nWait, no: B is dominant, so any B allele makes it brown. Even if the bird is Bb, it's brown. Similarly, b is recessive, so any b allele makes it checkered, regardless of C. Wait, no: b is recessive for color, so any bird with at least one b allele is checkered. So:\n\n- bb \u2192 checkered (regardless of C)\n- Bb \u2192 brown (regardless of c)\n- Cb \u2192 brown (regardless of B)\n- CC \u2192 red (regardless of B or b)\n- cc \u2192 plain (regardless of C or B)\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me think again. The order of precedence is:\n\nFirst, pigment color (C > c), then color (B > b). So:\n\n- If the bird is red (C_), it doesn't matter about color (B or b).\n- If the bird is plain (c_), it doesn't matter about color (B or b).\n- If the bird is brown (B_), it doesn't matter about pigment (C or c).\n- If the bird is checkered (b_), it doesn't matter about color (B or b).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because checkered implies both are b, but brown implies at least one B. So:\n\n- Checkered: bb\n- Plain: cc\n- Brown: Bb (regardless of c)\n- Red: Cb (regardless of B)\n\nWait, but that would mean that all Bb and Bb have brown, regardless of c. Similarly, all Cb have brown, regardless of B. And all cc have plain, regardless of anything else. And all bb have checkered, regardless of B.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered: bb\n2. Plain: cc\n3. Brown: Bb\n4. Red: Cb\n\nBut wait, in reality, an animal's phenotype is determined by the highest priority trait. So, if it's red, it's red regardless of other traits. If it's plain, it's plain regardless. If it's brown, it's brown regardless of pigment. If it's checkered, it's checkered regardless of color.\n\nSo, according to this, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: bb\n- Plain: cc\n- Brown: Bb\n- Red: Cb\n\nWait, but in reality, the order is pigment first, then color. So:\n\n- If the bird is red (C_), it's red.\n- If it's plain (c_), it's plain.\n- If it's brown (B_), it's brown.\n- If it's checkered (b_), it's checkered.\n\nThat makes sense. So, in the F2 generation, the possible genotypes and phenotypes are:\n\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain\n- Bb \u2192 brown\n- Cb \u2192 brown\n\nNow, the question is asking for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. How many of each phenotype do we expect?\n\nLet's compute the probabilities based on Mendelian inheritance.\n\nAssuming independent assortment, each F2 generation will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four possible genotypes (but adjusted for dominance and phenotypes). Wait, no: because some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but in this case, each F2 individual will have one of the four possible genotypes, each with equal probability (assuming random mating and independent assortment), but some genotypes will correspond to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, no: in reality, the genotypes determine the phenotype, but multiple genotypes can lead to the same phenotype. So, the actual counts per phenotype depend on how many genotypes map to each phenotype.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Checkered: only bb\n- Plain: only cc\n- Brown: Bb and Bb? No, wait: Bb and Bb are same genotype, so 1 genotype leads to brown. Similarly, Cb and Cb are same, so 1 genotype leads to brown. Also, Bb and Cb are different genotypes but both lead to brown. Wait, no: Bb and Cb are different, but both lead to brown.\n\nWait, no, because Bb and Cb are different genotypes, but both would result in brown. So, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: 1 (bb)\n- Plain: 1 (cc)\n- Brown: 2 (Bb and Cb)\n- Red: 2 (Cc and Cc?)\n\nWait, no, let's double-check. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes in F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red\n2. CC BB \u2192 red (same as 1)\n3. CC BB \u2192 red\n4. CC BB \u2192 red\n5. CC BB \u2192 red\n6. CC BB \u2192 red\n7. CC BB \u2192 red\n8. CC BB \u2192 red\n9. CC BB \u2192 red\n10. CC BB \u2192 red\n11. CC BB \u2192 red\n12. CC BB \u2192 red\n13. CC BB \u2192 red\n14. CC BB \u2192 red\n15. CC BB \u2192 red\n16. CC BB \u2192 red\n\nWait, that's too many. Actually, in F2, each parent produces four gametes, so 16 possible combinations. But considering dominance, many gametes are the same. Alternatively, since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow a 1:2:1 ratio for the F1, but for the F2, it's a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combined phenotypes.\n\nWait, no, because we're dealing with two traits, so the phenotypic ratio combines both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nParental genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous)\n\nF1: CcBb (all possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb)\n\nWait, but Parent 1 can only give CB, and Parent 2 can only give cb, so F1 is CcBb, and all gametes are CB and cb (each 50%).\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nGametes:\n\n- CB: 50%\n- cb: 50%\n\nSo, the Punnett square is:\n\n```\n          | CB    | cb\n----------+--------+-----\n        CB   | CC BB | Cc BB\n        cb   | Cc BB | cc BB\n```\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Each parent contributes two alleles, so the square should represent all possible combinations.\n\nActually, the correct F2 square for CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is:\n\n```\n          | CB    | cb\n----------+--------+-----\n        CB   | CC BB | Cc BB\n        cb   | Cc BB | cc BB\n```\n\nSo, the F2 generation consists of four genotypes",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes may look the same phenotypically. For example, Cc and Cc are the same phenotype because they're both dominant. Similarly, bb and cc are different phenotypes if they express the recessive traits.\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes, the F2 would include the following:\n\n- Checkered Red (if genotype is cc BB): Phenotype depends on the combination of alleles. Since both parents are homozygous, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC BB (red), Cc BB (red), cc BB (checkered), and Cc bb (since B is dominant over b, so it'll still be brown?), wait no\u2014wait, B is dominant, so any presence of B results in brown. bb means both are recessive, so if B is present, it's brown. But wait, let me clarify: If a bird has at least one B allele, it will be brown. Only if both are b (bb) will it be checkered. Same logic applies for b and B. So, for phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red (pigment dominant)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red (pigment dominant)\n- cc BB \u2192 checkered (both recessive)\n- Cc bb \u2192 brown (pigment dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, the bird's color depends on both B and b. So, if either B or b is present, the bird is brown. Only when both are absent (bb) does it become checkered. Similarly for pigment color: if either C or c is present, the bird is red. Only when both are absent (cc) does it become plain.\n\nSo, for F2:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB and cc bb\n- Plain: cc BB and cc bb? Wait, no. Because cc BB is checkered, and cc bb is plain. So:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB (only)\n- Plain: cc bb (only)\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one b, then it's checkered regardless of B. Similarly, if a bird has at least one B, it's brown regardless of c.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes and phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red (pigment dominant, since C is dominant)\n- Cc BB: red (pigment dominant)\n- cc BB: checkered (both recessive)\n- Cc bb: brown (pigment dominant, since B is dominant)\n- cc bb: checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, what are the phenotypic ratios?\n\nEach F2 individual will have one of the five genotypes above, each with equal probability (assuming independent assortment and random fertilization).\n\nThe number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB and cc bb \u2192 total 2\n- Plain: cc bb and ... Wait, no. Wait, the phenotypes are based on the presence of alleles that are dominant. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one B, it's brown.\n- If the bird has at least one b, it's checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype categories are:\n\n1. Brown: All individuals that have at least one B (including those with B and b alleles).\n2. Checkered: Those that have neither B nor b alleles (i.e., bb).\n3. Red: Those that don't meet the criteria for brown or checkered, i.e., lack both B and b alleles.\n\nWait, but in our case, the F2 includes all possible genotypes. Let's count how many fall into each category.\n\nTotal F2 individuals: Each parent contributes 4 gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations, but due to dominance and recessiveness, some will combine into the same phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the genetic ratios.\n\nUsing the rules of Mendelian inheritance and assuming independent assortment:\n\n- The probability of being checkered (cc BB) is 1/16 (since bb is 1/16, and BB is another 1/16, but they're separate phenotypes unless they're expressed differently. Wait, no: in terms of phenotype, checkered is only cc BB, and plain is only cc bb. So:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16 (cc BB)\n- Plain: 1/16 (cc bb)\n- Brown: Individuals without B (so B must be absent) but can have b. So, the genotype could be Cc bb, CC bb, or Cc BB. Wait, no:\n\nWait, better approach: For phenotype brown, the bird must have at least one B allele. So the genotypes are:\n\n- C_B_ (any combination where B is present)\n- CC_B_ (but in F2, all are diploid, so it's C_C_, but for simplicity, we can consider C_B_ as having at least one B.)\n\nSimilarly, for checkered, the bird must have at least one b allele: _bb.\n\nPhenotype brown occurs when the bird has at least one B allele, regardless of b. Phew. So:\n\nPhenotype brown: All except checkered.\n\nWait, no: checkered is when both alleles are recessive (bb), while brown is when there's at least one dominant allele (either B or b). So:\n\nPhenotype brown: All individuals who are not checkered.\n\nPhenotype checkered: Only checkered (cc BB).\n\nPhenotype red: Only plain (cc bb).\n\nWait, no, wait: checkered is only when both are recessive (bb) and no B or b alleles. Brown is when there's at least one B (regardless of b). Red is when both are recessive (cc) and both are recessive in B (bb)? Wait, no. Wait, let me get this straight.\n\nEach bird's genotype and phenotype are determined independently for each trait, right? So, the presence of B (dominant) makes it brown, and the presence of b (recessive) makes it checkered, regardless of whether the other trait is present or not.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown: Presence of B (at least one B allele), regardless of b.\n- Checkered: Both alleles are recessive (bb), regardless of B.\n- Red: Neither B nor b alleles, i.e., both are recessive (cc).\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown: All except checkered.\n- Checkered: Only cc BB.\n- Red: Only cc bb.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered : Plain : Brown = 1 : 1 : 3\n\nBecause:\n\n- Checkered: 1 (cc BB)\n- Plain: 1 (cc bb)\n- Brown: 3 (CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb?) Wait, no. Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me use the Punnett square approach properly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red (pigment dominant)\n- Cc BB: red (pigment dominant)\n- CC bb: brown (pigment dominant)\n- Cc bb: brown (pigment dominant)\n- cc BB: checkered\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: cc BB and cc bb \u2192 total 2\n- Red: CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 total 4\n- Brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 wait no, wait:\n\nWait, no:\n\n- Brown requires at least one B allele. So:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 B present\n- CC BB \u2192 B present\n- Cc bb \u2192 B present\n- CC bb \u2192 B present\n\nSo, all these have at least one B, hence brown.\n\n- Checkered: only cc BB and cc bb \u2192 2\n\n- Red: only cc bb and cc BB? No, wait: red requires neither C nor c (i.e., cc) and neither B nor b (i.e., bb). Wait, no:\n\nWait, red requires neither pigment (C) and neither color (b). So:\n\n- cc BB \u2192 B is dominant, so brown. Wait, no, because cc is the recessive for pigment, and BB is dominant for color. So, cc BB \u2192 B is present, so brown.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let me clarify the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- c is recessive (plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- B is dominant (brown)\n- b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Red if C is present (C_), regardless of B.\n- Brown if B is present (B_), regardless of C.\n- Checkered if neither B nor c is present (bb and cc? Wait, no: checkered is when both are recessive (cc), but also when B is recessive (bb). Wait, no:\n\nNo, actually, checkered is when both alleles are recessive (cc), regardless of B. Brown is when B is present (B_), regardless of c. Red is when C is present (C_), regardless of b.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me try again:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for pigment (C and c) and two alleles for color (B and b).\n\n- Pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n\n- Color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined first by pigment color, then by color.\n\nThus:\n\n- If the bird has C (C_), it's red, regardless of B.\n- If the bird has B (B_), it's brown, regardless of C.\n- If the bird has neither B nor c (i.e., bb), it's checkered, regardless of C.\n\nWait, no: if the bird has bb, it's checkered, regardless of pigment color.\n\nIf the bird has B, even if it's bb (checkered), it's brown.\n\nSimilarly, if it has c (recessive pigment), even if it's bb (checkered), it's plain.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: bb (regardless of B)\n- Plain: cc (regardless of B)\n- Brown: Bb (regardless of c)\n- Red: Cb (regardless of B?)\n\nWait, no: C is dominant, so any bird with C is red, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with B is brown, regardless of c.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered: bb\n2. Plain: cc\n3. Brown: Bb\n4. Red: Cb\n\nWait, but in reality, it's:\n\n- If the bird is bb (checkered), it's checked, regardless of B.\n- If it's Bb (has B but not b), it's brown.\n- If it's Bb (has b but not B), it's brown?\nWait, no, because the order is considered first. So, B is dominant over b, so Bb would be brown regardless of c. Similarly, bb would be checkered regardless of C.\n\nWait, let me structure this properly:\n\nPhenotype determination proceeds in order of priority:\n\n1. Pigment color: C (red) > c (plain)\n2. Color: B (brown) > b (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined by checking for pigment color first. If it's red, it doesn't matter about color. If it's plain, it doesn't matter about color. If it's brown, it doesn't matter about pigment. If it's checkered, it doesn't matter about color.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: bb\n- Plain: cc\n- Brown: Bb\n- Red: Cb\n\nWait, but in reality, a bird like Bb is brown because it has B (dominant). A bird like Bb is brown. A bird like Bb (but actually, all Bb would be brown, regardless of c). Similarly, a bird like Bb would be brown regardless of c, whereas a bird like Bb (with c) would be brown anyway.\n\nWait, no: B is dominant, so any B allele makes it brown. Even if the bird is Bb, it's brown. Similarly, b is recessive, so any b allele makes it checkered, regardless of C. Wait, no: b is recessive for color, so any bird with at least one b allele is checkered. So:\n\n- bb \u2192 checkered (regardless of C)\n- Bb \u2192 brown (regardless of c)\n- Cb \u2192 brown (regardless of B)\n- CC \u2192 red (regardless of B or b)\n- cc \u2192 plain (regardless of C or B)\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me think again. The order of precedence is:\n\nFirst, pigment color (C > c), then color (B > b). So:\n\n- If the bird is red (C_), it doesn't matter about color (B or b).\n- If the bird is plain (c_), it doesn't matter about color (B or b).\n- If the bird is brown (B_), it doesn't matter about pigment (C or c).\n- If the bird is checkered (b_), it doesn't matter about color (B or b).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because checkered implies both are b, but brown implies at least one B. So:\n\n- Checkered: bb\n- Plain: cc\n- Brown: Bb (regardless of c)\n- Red: Cb (regardless of B)\n\nWait, but that would mean that all Bb and Bb have brown, regardless of c. Similarly, all Cb have brown, regardless of B. And all cc have plain, regardless of anything else. And all bb have checkered, regardless of B.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered: bb\n2. Plain: cc\n3. Brown: Bb\n4. Red: Cb\n\nBut wait, in reality, an animal's phenotype is determined by the highest priority trait. So, if it's red, it's red regardless of other traits. If it's plain, it's plain regardless. If it's brown, it's brown regardless of pigment. If it's checkered, it's checkered regardless of color.\n\nSo, according to this, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: bb\n- Plain: cc\n- Brown: Bb\n- Red: Cb\n\nWait, but in reality, the order is pigment first, then color. So:\n\n- If the bird is red (C_), it's red.\n- If it's plain (c_), it's plain.\n- If it's brown (B_), it's brown.\n- If it's checkered (b_), it's checkered.\n\nThat makes sense. So, in the F2 generation, the possible genotypes and phenotypes are:\n\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain\n- Bb \u2192 brown\n- Cb \u2192 brown\n\nNow, the question is asking for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. How many of each phenotype do we expect?\n\nLet's compute the probabilities based on Mendelian inheritance.\n\nAssuming independent assortment, each F2 generation will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four possible genotypes (but adjusted for dominance and phenotypes). Wait, no: because some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but in this case, each F2 individual will have one of the four possible genotypes, each with equal probability (assuming random mating and independent assortment), but some genotypes will correspond to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, no: in reality, the genotypes determine the phenotype, but multiple genotypes can lead to the same phenotype. So, the actual counts per phenotype depend on how many genotypes map to each phenotype.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Checkered: only bb\n- Plain: only cc\n- Brown: Bb and Bb? No, wait: Bb and Bb are same genotype, so 1 genotype leads to brown. Similarly, Cb and Cb are same, so 1 genotype leads to brown. Also, Bb and Cb are different genotypes but both lead to brown. Wait, no: Bb and Cb are different, but both lead to brown.\n\nWait, no, because Bb and Cb are different genotypes, but both would result in brown. So, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: 1 (bb)\n- Plain: 1 (cc)\n- Brown: 2 (Bb and Cb)\n- Red: 2 (Cc and Cc?)\n\nWait, no, let's double-check. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes in F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red\n2. CC BB \u2192 red (same as 1)\n3. CC BB \u2192 red\n4. CC BB \u2192 red\n5. CC BB \u2192 red\n6. CC BB \u2192 red\n7. CC BB \u2192 red\n8. CC BB \u2192 red\n9. CC BB \u2192 red\n10. CC BB \u2192 red\n11. CC BB \u2192 red\n12. CC BB \u2192 red\n13. CC BB \u2192 red\n14. CC BB \u2192 red\n15. CC BB \u2192 red\n16. CC BB \u2192 red\n\nWait, that's too many. Actually, in F2, each parent produces four gametes, so 16 possible combinations. But considering dominance, many gametes are the same. Alternatively, since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow a 1:2:1 ratio for the F1, but for the F2, it's a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combined phenotypes.\n\nWait, no, because we're dealing with two traits, so the phenotypic ratio combines both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nParental genotypes:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous)\n\nF1: CcBb (all possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb)\n\nWait, but Parent 1 can only give CB, and Parent 2 can only give cb, so F1 is CcBb, and all gametes are CB and cb (each 50%).\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\nGametes:\n\n- CB: 50%\n- cb: 50%\n\nSo, the Punnett square is:\n\n```\n          | CB    | cb\n----------+--------+-----\n        CB   | CC BB | Cc BB\n        cb   | Cc BB | cc BB\n```\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Each parent contributes two alleles, so the square should represent all possible combinations.\n\nActually, the correct F2 square for CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is:\n\n```\n          | CB    | cb\n----------+--------+-----\n        CB   | CC BB | Cc BB\n        cb   | Cc BB | cc BB\n```\n\nSo, the F2 generation consists of four genotypes",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering the actual alleles, the F2 genotypes would be:",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering the actual alleles, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\n- For gene B:\n  - BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 would have 9 possible genotypic combinations. However, the question mentions the F2 phenotypes, so we'll need to determine the phenotypes based on the genotypes.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on both genes. The dominant alleles are C and B, while the recessives are c and b. So:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Checkered red (since c is plain and b is checkered)\n- Dominant C and recessive B \u2192 Checkered brown (because b is recessive)\n- Recessive c and dominant B \u2192 Plain brown (because c is plain)\n- Recessive c and recessive b \u2192 Plain red (because b is recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C or B, it will be Checkered. Only if both are recessive (cc and bb) will it be plain. Similarly, for color: Brown requires at least one dominant allele for B (either B or b), and checkered requires at least one dominant allele for c (either c or C).\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird is Checkered (both alleles recessive) or Plain (dominant alleles present). Similarly for color: Brown (at least one dominant B) vs. Checkered (both alleles recessive for B, i.e., bb).\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (cc and bb):\n  - If it's brown (bb and B_), then it's plain brown.\n  - If it's checkered (bb and c_), then it's plain red.\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s more precise to say:\n\nFor Pigmentation (B/b):\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (cc):\n  - If it has at least one dominant B (i.e., B_), it will appear Brown.\n  - If it doesn't have any B (i.e., bb), it will appear Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for Pigmentation (B/b):\n\nWait, I think I got that reversed. The presence of at least one dominant allele (B or b) leads to Brown, and only when both are recessive (cc) does it become Checkered. Same for the other gene.\n\nBut in terms of the overall phenotype, the bird will be:\n\n- Checkered (plain) only if both genes are recessive (cc and bb).\n- Else, it will be either Checkered (if one gene is recessive and the other dominant) or Plain (if both genes are recessive). Wait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, it's plain. If any gene is dominant, it becomes Checkered or brown.\n\nWait, let me structure this properly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotype for each gene is determined independently, except that the presence of a dominant allele affects the other.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigmentation (B/b): \n  - Brown (B_ or Bb) : dominant B \u2192 appears Brown.\n  - Checkered (bb) : recessive b \u2192 appears Checkered.\n\n- Pigmentation (C/C): \n  - Red (C_) : dominant C \u2192 appears Red.\n  - Plain (cc) : recessive c \u2192 appears Plain.\n\nBut wait, the way the question describes it, each bird has both genes. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nThus, the overall phenotype can be determined by checking both genes:\n\n1. For Pigmentation (B/b):\n   - If B is present (B_), it's Brown.\n   - If b is present (bb), it's Checkered.\n\n2. For Pigmentation (C/C):\n   - If C is present (C_), it's Red.\n   - If c is present (cc), it's Plain.\n\nHowever, the overall phenotype combines both genes. So, a bird could be:\n\n- Both genes recessive: Checkered (from c and c) and plain (from c and c) \u2192 Checkered plain?\nWait, no\u2014wait, the overall phenotype isn't a combination of both genes. Instead, each gene contributes to the overall trait. So:\n\n- A bird is Checkered if both genes are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 plain.\n- Otherwise, it is Checkered (if one gene is recessive, the other dominant) or plain (both genes recessive).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, for Pigmentation (B/b):\n\n- Brown (B_) \u2192 Presence of B \u2192 Brown\n- Checkered (bb) \u2192 Absence of B \u2192 Checkered\n\nSimilarly, for Pigmentation (C/C):\n\n- Red (C_) \u2192 Presence of C \u2192 Red\n- Plain (cc) \u2192 Absence of C \u2192 Plain\n\nBut the presence of B or C affects the other gene. So, the overall phenotype is determined by the combination of both. Thus:\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (both genes recessive), regardless of B/B or C/C, it's plain.\n- If the bird is Checkered (one recessive), it's Checkered (plain) only if the other gene is dominant.\n- Wait, no\u2014the overall phenotype is based on both genes. So:\n\nA bird will be:\n\n- **Checkered** (plain) only if both genes are recessive (cc and bb). Because neither gene allows for pigmentation or color change beyond that.\n\nIf either gene is dominant in pigmentation, the bird is either Red or Brown.\n\nSimilarly, for color (C/C):\n\n- **Plain** only if both genes are recessive (cc) and **Red** if at least one gene is dominant (C).\n\nBut how do these combine?\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (red, brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n2. CC Bb (red, brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. CC bb (red, brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown? Wait, no. Wait, the color is determined by the C/C gene. So CC is dominant C \u2192 Red. Similarly, Bb is dominant B \u2192 Brown. So the phenotype is Checkered brown.\n\nWait, but the pigmentation is independent of the color. So, if a bird is Checkered (both genes recessive), it's plain. Otherwise, it's either Checkered (if one gene is recessive) or Plain (if both are recessive). Wait, no\u2014the overall phenotype is determined by both genes. So, if the bird is Checkered (both genes recessive), it's plain. If it's Checkered (one gene recessive), it's Checkered (but since both genes are recessive, it's plain). Wait, I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the combination of the two genes. For a bird to be Checkered (plain), both genes must be recessive (cc and bb). If either gene is dominant, the bird is either red or brown.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (C= dominant for color, B= dominant for pigmentation): Phenotype = Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n2. CC Bb (C= dominant for color, B= dominant for pigmentation): Phenotype = Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n3. CC bb (C= dominant, B= recessive): Phenotype = Red and Plain \u2192 Checkered red.\n\n4. Cc BB (C= dominant, B= dominant): Phenotype = Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n5. Cc Bb (C= dominant, B= dominant): Phenotype = Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n6. Cc bb (C= dominant, B= recessive): Phenotype = Red and Plain \u2192 Checkered red.\n\n7. cc BB (C= recessive, B= dominant): Phenotype = Plain and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n8. cc Bb (C= recessive, B= dominant): Phenotype = Plain and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n9. cc bb (C= recessive, B= recessive): Phenotype = Plain and Plain \u2192 Checkered plain.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, some answer choices suggest that the checkered phenotype includes both Checkered red and Checkered brown. But according to the above analysis, if both genes are recessive, it's Checkered plain. If one gene is recessive, it's Checkered (which would be plain). Wait, no\u2014in the previous analysis, the Checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, leading to plain. Any bird that is Checkered (both genes recessive) is plain. All others are either Checkered (if one gene is recessive) or Plain (if both are recessive). But that contradicts earlier statements where I thought Checkered implies both genes recessive. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify the definitions:\n\n- **Checkered**: Only when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). This results in plain color and plain pigmentation.\n\n- **Plain**: When at least one allele is recessive for each gene. That includes cases like cc and bb (plain color and plain pigmentation), or cc and B_, etc.\n\nTherefore, a bird is:\n\n- **Checkered (plain)** only if both genes are recessive (cc and bb).\n- **Plain** otherwise, meaning at least one allele is recessive for each gene.\n\nSo, applying this to our F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both genes are dominant, so Checkered plain.\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both genes are dominant, Checkered plain.\n3. CC bb \u2192 One dominant, one recessive. So, Checkered red (since B is recessive, thus brown, but the bird is Checkered because one gene is recessive). Wait, no\u2014the presence of a dominant allele in one gene makes the bird non-checkered. So, if both genes are dominant, it's Checkered (plain)? No, no\u2014I think I've mixed up. Let me re-examine:\n\nWait, the pigmentation (B/b) is determined by having at least one dominant allele (B). So, if the bird is B_ or Bb, it's Brown. If it's bb, it's Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for pigmentation (C/C), having at least one dominant allele (C) makes it Red, else plain.\n\nSo, the overall phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore:\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (both genes recessive): plain color and plain pigmentation.\n- If it's Checkered due to one gene being recessive (e.g., cc and B_): it's plain and Brown.\n- Similarly, if it's plain (both genes recessive): plain color and plain pigmentation.\n- If it's plain due to one gene being recessive (e.g., cc and bb): it's plain color and plain pigmentation.\n- If it's Checkered due to one gene being recessive and the other dominant (e.g., cc and B_): it's plain and Brown.\n- If it's plain due to both genes being recessive: plain color and plain pigmentation.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me use a table to clarify:\n\n| Genotype | Pigmentation (B) | Pigmentation (C) | Overall Phenotype |\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| CC BB     | Brown             | Red              | Checkered brown  |\n| CC Bb     | Brown             | Red              | Checkered brown  |\n| CC bb     | Brown             | Plain            | Checkered red    |\n| Cc BB     | Brown             | Red              | Checkered brown  |\n| Cc Bb     | Brown             | Red              | Checkered brown  |\n| Cc bb     | Brown             | Plain            | Checkered red    |\n| cc BB     | Plain             | Red              | Checkered red    |\n| cc Bb     | Plain             | Red              | Checkered red    |\n| cc bb     | Plain             | Plain            | Checkered plain  |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that:\n\n- Checkered (plain) occurs only when both genes are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 phenotype: Checkered plain.\n\n- All other cases involve at least one dominant allele in either gene, resulting in either Checkered brown or Checkered red.\n\n- Plain (color and pigmentation) occurs when at least one gene is recessive for each trait. Specifically:\n\n  - cc (for color) and bb (for pigmentation): plain color and plain pigmentation.\n  - cc (for color) and B_ (pigmentation): plain color and brown pigmentation.\n  - cc (for color) and C_ (pigmentation): same as above.\n  - cc and B_ (pigmentation): same as above.\n  - cc and C_ (pigmentation): same as above.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes would include:\n\n- Checkered brown (phenotype: Checkered brown)\n- Checkered red (phenotype: Checkered red)\n- Checkered plain (phenotype: Checkered plain)\n- Plain color and brown pigmentation (phenotype: Checkered red)\n- Plain color and plain pigmentation (phenotype: Checkered plain)\n- Plain color and brown pigmentation (again, same as above)\n- Plain color and plain pigmentation (same as above)\n- Checkered red (again, same as above)\n- Checkered plain (again, same as above)\n\nWait, but looking back, the phenotypes in the options don't seem to match my conclusion. Looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to fit my reasoning. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Checkered phenotype refers to when both genes are recessive, leading to plain color and plain pigmentation. And when at least one gene is dominant, the phenotype is brown or red accordingly. So, the overall phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered plain (both genes recessive)\n2. Checkered brown (one gene recessive, other dominant)\n3. Checkered red (one gene recessive, other dominant)\n4. Plain brown (one gene recessive, other dominant)\n5. Plain red (one gene recessive, other dominant)\n6. Plain plain (both genes recessive)\n\nWait, but that still leads us to the same issue. Let me look at the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"Checkered\" refers to the bird being Checkered in pigmentation, regardless of color. But that doesn't make sense because the phenotype is determined by both traits. Alternatively, maybe \"Checkered\" refers to the bird being Checkered in pigmentation, irrespective of color. But that also doesn't align with standard terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's confusion in the definition of Checkered. In some contexts, Checkered might mean both genes are recessive, leading to plain. While in others, Checkered could mean that at least one allele is recessive, leading to Checkered in pigmentation (plain) if both are recessive, but that doesn't make sense. I think the key is that in this context, Checkered is defined as both alleles being recessive for both genes, leading to plain color and plain pigmentation. Whereas, if any allele is dominant for either gene, the bird is either red or brown, respectively.\n\nGiven that, let's reconstruct the F2 phenotypes based on the correct definitions.\n\nUsing the F2 genotypes from the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered plain\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered plain\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n- Checkered plain: Cases 1, 2, 7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 3,4,5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red: Cases 6,8,9 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered plain: Again, Cases 1,2,7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Wait, this adds up to 3+3+3+3+3=15, which is impossible since there are only 9 F2 individuals. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, no, in F2, each individual is a unique combination, so total of 9. Let me recount:\n\nCases 1-9:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered plain\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nSo, the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered plain: Cases 1,2,7,9 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3,4,5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red: Cases 6,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Total: 4+3+2=9\n\nWait, but that sums to 9, which is correct. So now, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered plain: 4 cases \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered plain\n- Checkered brown: 3 cases \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n- Checkered red: 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this. However, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the term \"Checkered.\" If \"Checkered\" refers to the bird being Checkered in pigmentation, regardless of color, then:\n\n- Checkered brown (phenotype: Checkered brown) \u2192 Cases 3,4,5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red (phenotype: Checkered red) \u2192 Cases 6,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown (phenotype: Checkered brown?) Wait, no, if \"Checkered\" is pigmentation, then:\n\nWait, I think I",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering the actual alleles, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\n- For gene B:\n  - BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 would have 9 possible genotypic combinations. However, the question mentions the F2 phenotypes, so we'll need to determine the phenotypes based on the genotypes.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on both genes. The dominant alleles are C and B, while the recessives are c and b. So:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Checkered red (since c is plain and b is checkered)\n- Dominant C and recessive B \u2192 Checkered brown (because b is recessive)\n- Recessive c and dominant B \u2192 Plain brown (because c is plain)\n- Recessive c and recessive b \u2192 Plain red (because b is recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C or B, it will be Checkered. Only if both are recessive (cc and bb) will it be plain. Similarly, for color: Brown requires at least one dominant allele for B (either B or b), and checkered requires at least one dominant allele for c (either c or C).\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird is Checkered (both alleles recessive) or Plain (dominant alleles present). Similarly for color: Brown (at least one dominant B) vs. Checkered (both alleles recessive for B, i.e., bb).\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (cc and bb):\n  - If it's brown (bb and B_), then it's plain brown.\n  - If it's checkered (bb and c_), then it's plain red.\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s more precise to say:\n\nFor Pigmentation (B/b):\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (cc):\n  - If it has at least one dominant B (i.e., B_), it will appear Brown.\n  - If it doesn't have any B (i.e., bb), it will appear Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for Pigmentation (B/b):\n\nWait, I think I got that reversed. The presence of at least one dominant allele (B or b) leads to Brown, and only when both are recessive (cc) does it become Checkered. Same for the other gene.\n\nBut in terms of the overall phenotype, the bird will be:\n\n- Checkered (plain) only if both genes are recessive (cc and bb).\n- Else, it will be either Checkered (if one gene is recessive and the other dominant) or Plain (if both genes are recessive). Wait, no\u2014if both genes are recessive, it's plain. If any gene is dominant, it becomes Checkered or brown.\n\nWait, let me structure this properly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotype for each gene is determined independently, except that the presence of a dominant allele affects the other.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigmentation (B/b): \n  - Brown (B_ or Bb) : dominant B \u2192 appears Brown.\n  - Checkered (bb) : recessive b \u2192 appears Checkered.\n\n- Pigmentation (C/C): \n  - Red (C_) : dominant C \u2192 appears Red.\n  - Plain (cc) : recessive c \u2192 appears Plain.\n\nBut wait, the way the question describes it, each bird has both genes. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nThus, the overall phenotype can be determined by checking both genes:\n\n1. For Pigmentation (B/b):\n   - If B is present (B_), it's Brown.\n   - If b is present (bb), it's Checkered.\n\n2. For Pigmentation (C/C):\n   - If C is present (C_), it's Red.\n   - If c is present (cc), it's Plain.\n\nHowever, the overall phenotype combines both genes. So, a bird could be:\n\n- Both genes recessive: Checkered (from c and c) and plain (from c and c) \u2192 Checkered plain?\nWait, no\u2014wait, the overall phenotype isn't a combination of both genes. Instead, each gene contributes to the overall trait. So:\n\n- A bird is Checkered if both genes are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 plain.\n- Otherwise, it is Checkered (if one gene is recessive, the other dominant) or plain (both genes recessive).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, for Pigmentation (B/b):\n\n- Brown (B_) \u2192 Presence of B \u2192 Brown\n- Checkered (bb) \u2192 Absence of B \u2192 Checkered\n\nSimilarly, for Pigmentation (C/C):\n\n- Red (C_) \u2192 Presence of C \u2192 Red\n- Plain (cc) \u2192 Absence of C \u2192 Plain\n\nBut the presence of B or C affects the other gene. So, the overall phenotype is determined by the combination of both. Thus:\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (both genes recessive), regardless of B/B or C/C, it's plain.\n- If the bird is Checkered (one recessive), it's Checkered (plain) only if the other gene is dominant.\n- Wait, no\u2014the overall phenotype is based on both genes. So:\n\nA bird will be:\n\n- **Checkered** (plain) only if both genes are recessive (cc and bb). Because neither gene allows for pigmentation or color change beyond that.\n\nIf either gene is dominant in pigmentation, the bird is either Red or Brown.\n\nSimilarly, for color (C/C):\n\n- **Plain** only if both genes are recessive (cc) and **Red** if at least one gene is dominant (C).\n\nBut how do these combine?\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (red, brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n2. CC Bb (red, brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. CC bb (red, brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown? Wait, no. Wait, the color is determined by the C/C gene. So CC is dominant C \u2192 Red. Similarly, Bb is dominant B \u2192 Brown. So the phenotype is Checkered brown.\n\nWait, but the pigmentation is independent of the color. So, if a bird is Checkered (both genes recessive), it's plain. Otherwise, it's either Checkered (if one gene is recessive) or Plain (if both are recessive). Wait, no\u2014the overall phenotype is determined by both genes. So, if the bird is Checkered (both genes recessive), it's plain. If it's Checkered (one gene recessive), it's Checkered (but since both genes are recessive, it's plain). Wait, I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the combination of the two genes. For a bird to be Checkered (plain), both genes must be recessive (cc and bb). If either gene is dominant, the bird is either red or brown.\n\nSo, the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (C= dominant for color, B= dominant for pigmentation): Phenotype = Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n2. CC Bb (C= dominant for color, B= dominant for pigmentation): Phenotype = Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n3. CC bb (C= dominant, B= recessive): Phenotype = Red and Plain \u2192 Checkered red.\n\n4. Cc BB (C= dominant, B= dominant): Phenotype = Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n5. Cc Bb (C= dominant, B= dominant): Phenotype = Red and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n6. Cc bb (C= dominant, B= recessive): Phenotype = Red and Plain \u2192 Checkered red.\n\n7. cc BB (C= recessive, B= dominant): Phenotype = Plain and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n8. cc Bb (C= recessive, B= dominant): Phenotype = Plain and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown.\n\n9. cc bb (C= recessive, B= recessive): Phenotype = Plain and Plain \u2192 Checkered plain.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, some answer choices suggest that the checkered phenotype includes both Checkered red and Checkered brown. But according to the above analysis, if both genes are recessive, it's Checkered plain. If one gene is recessive, it's Checkered (which would be plain). Wait, no\u2014in the previous analysis, the Checkered phenotype is when both genes are recessive, leading to plain. Any bird that is Checkered (both genes recessive) is plain. All others are either Checkered (if one gene is recessive) or Plain (if both are recessive). But that contradicts earlier statements where I thought Checkered implies both genes recessive. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify the definitions:\n\n- **Checkered**: Only when both genes are recessive (cc and bb). This results in plain color and plain pigmentation.\n\n- **Plain**: When at least one allele is recessive for each gene. That includes cases like cc and bb (plain color and plain pigmentation), or cc and B_, etc.\n\nTherefore, a bird is:\n\n- **Checkered (plain)** only if both genes are recessive (cc and bb).\n- **Plain** otherwise, meaning at least one allele is recessive for each gene.\n\nSo, applying this to our F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both genes are dominant, so Checkered plain.\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Both genes are dominant, Checkered plain.\n3. CC bb \u2192 One dominant, one recessive. So, Checkered red (since B is recessive, thus brown, but the bird is Checkered because one gene is recessive). Wait, no\u2014the presence of a dominant allele in one gene makes the bird non-checkered. So, if both genes are dominant, it's Checkered (plain)? No, no\u2014I think I've mixed up. Let me re-examine:\n\nWait, the pigmentation (B/b) is determined by having at least one dominant allele (B). So, if the bird is B_ or Bb, it's Brown. If it's bb, it's Checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for pigmentation (C/C), having at least one dominant allele (C) makes it Red, else plain.\n\nSo, the overall phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore:\n\n- If the bird is Checkered (both genes recessive): plain color and plain pigmentation.\n- If it's Checkered due to one gene being recessive (e.g., cc and B_): it's plain and Brown.\n- Similarly, if it's plain (both genes recessive): plain color and plain pigmentation.\n- If it's plain due to one gene being recessive (e.g., cc and bb): it's plain color and plain pigmentation.\n- If it's Checkered due to one gene being recessive and the other dominant (e.g., cc and B_): it's plain and Brown.\n- If it's plain due to both genes being recessive: plain color and plain pigmentation.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me use a table to clarify:\n\n| Genotype | Pigmentation (B) | Pigmentation (C) | Overall Phenotype |\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| CC BB     | Brown             | Red              | Checkered brown  |\n| CC Bb     | Brown             | Red              | Checkered brown  |\n| CC bb     | Brown             | Plain            | Checkered red    |\n| Cc BB     | Brown             | Red              | Checkered brown  |\n| Cc Bb     | Brown             | Red              | Checkered brown  |\n| Cc bb     | Brown             | Plain            | Checkered red    |\n| cc BB     | Plain             | Red              | Checkered red    |\n| cc Bb     | Plain             | Red              | Checkered red    |\n| cc bb     | Plain             | Plain            | Checkered plain  |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that:\n\n- Checkered (plain) occurs only when both genes are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 phenotype: Checkered plain.\n\n- All other cases involve at least one dominant allele in either gene, resulting in either Checkered brown or Checkered red.\n\n- Plain (color and pigmentation) occurs when at least one gene is recessive for each trait. Specifically:\n\n  - cc (for color) and bb (for pigmentation): plain color and plain pigmentation.\n  - cc (for color) and B_ (pigmentation): plain color and brown pigmentation.\n  - cc (for color) and C_ (pigmentation): same as above.\n  - cc and B_ (pigmentation): same as above.\n  - cc and C_ (pigmentation): same as above.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes would include:\n\n- Checkered brown (phenotype: Checkered brown)\n- Checkered red (phenotype: Checkered red)\n- Checkered plain (phenotype: Checkered plain)\n- Plain color and brown pigmentation (phenotype: Checkered red)\n- Plain color and plain pigmentation (phenotype: Checkered plain)\n- Plain color and brown pigmentation (again, same as above)\n- Plain color and plain pigmentation (same as above)\n- Checkered red (again, same as above)\n- Checkered plain (again, same as above)\n\nWait, but looking back, the phenotypes in the options don't seem to match my conclusion. Looking at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to fit my reasoning. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Checkered phenotype refers to when both genes are recessive, leading to plain color and plain pigmentation. And when at least one gene is dominant, the phenotype is brown or red accordingly. So, the overall phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered plain (both genes recessive)\n2. Checkered brown (one gene recessive, other dominant)\n3. Checkered red (one gene recessive, other dominant)\n4. Plain brown (one gene recessive, other dominant)\n5. Plain red (one gene recessive, other dominant)\n6. Plain plain (both genes recessive)\n\nWait, but that still leads us to the same issue. Let me look at the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"Checkered\" refers to the bird being Checkered in pigmentation, regardless of color. But that doesn't make sense because the phenotype is determined by both traits. Alternatively, maybe \"Checkered\" refers to the bird being Checkered in pigmentation, irrespective of color. But that also doesn't align with standard terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's confusion in the definition of Checkered. In some contexts, Checkered might mean both genes are recessive, leading to plain. While in others, Checkered could mean that at least one allele is recessive, leading to Checkered in pigmentation (plain) if both are recessive, but that doesn't make sense. I think the key is that in this context, Checkered is defined as both alleles being recessive for both genes, leading to plain color and plain pigmentation. Whereas, if any allele is dominant for either gene, the bird is either red or brown, respectively.\n\nGiven that, let's reconstruct the F2 phenotypes based on the correct definitions.\n\nUsing the F2 genotypes from the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered plain\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered plain\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nSo, the phenotypes and their counts:\n\n- Checkered plain: Cases 1, 2, 7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 3,4,5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red: Cases 6,8,9 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered plain: Again, Cases 1,2,7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Wait, this adds up to 3+3+3+3+3=15, which is impossible since there are only 9 F2 individuals. Clearly, I'm making a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, no, in F2, each individual is a unique combination, so total of 9. Let me recount:\n\nCases 1-9:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered plain\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nSo, the breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered plain: Cases 1,2,7,9 \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: Case 3,4,5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red: Cases 6,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Total: 4+3+2=9\n\nWait, but that sums to 9, which is correct. So now, mapping to phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered plain: 4 cases \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered plain\n- Checkered brown: 3 cases \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n- Checkered red: 2 cases \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this. However, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the term \"Checkered.\" If \"Checkered\" refers to the bird being Checkered in pigmentation, regardless of color, then:\n\n- Checkered brown (phenotype: Checkered brown) \u2192 Cases 3,4,5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red (phenotype: Checkered red) \u2192 Cases 6,8 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown (phenotype: Checkered brown?) Wait, no, if \"Checkered\" is pigmentation, then:\n\nWait, I think I",

So the correct breakdown would be:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB\n- 1/4 CC Bb\n- 1/4 CC bb\n- 1/4 Cc BB\n- 1/4 Cc Bb\n- 1/4 Cc bb\n- 1/4 cc BB\n- 1/4 cc Bb\n- 1/4 cc bb\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. \n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red (checkered or brown?)\nWait, the initial description says:\n\n- C = dominant (red)\n- c = recessive (plain)\n\nSo, if C is present, the bird is red, otherwise plain.\n\nColoration within the same phenotype is determined by B:\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, a bird is brown if it has at least one B allele, regardless of the C allele. If both C and B are present, it's brown. If only B is present, it's brown. Only when C is present and B is absent does it become plain.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- All birds with C (regardless of B) are red.\n- Among those, any presence of B makes them brown.\n- Those without C are plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes for F2:\n\n- Checkered red: All Cc and CcBb \u2192 1/4 (CC BB: none, CC Bb: none, CC bb: none, Cc BB: none, Cc Bb: none, Cc bb: none?) Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, the breakdown is:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB \u2192 plain red (since C is present and B is absent)\n- 1/4 CC Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- 1/4 CC bb \u2192 plain red\n- 1/4 Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 1/4 Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 1/4 Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n- 1/4 cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- 1/4 cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- 1/4 cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me count each category properly.\n\nThe F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: C present (C is dominant) \u2192 red. B absent (B is recessive) \u2192 plain. So plain red.\n2. CC Bb: Same as above \u2192 plain red.\n3. CC bb: C present, B absent \u2192 plain red.\n4. Cc BB: C present \u2192 red. B present \u2192 brown.\n5. Cc Bb: C present \u2192 red. B present \u2192 brown.\n6. Cc bb: C present \u2192 red. B absent \u2192 plain.\n7. cc BB: C absent \u2192 plain. B present \u2192 brown.\n8. cc Bb: C absent \u2192 plain. B present \u2192 brown.\n9. cc bb: C and B absent \u2192 plain.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n---|---\nPlain red | All without C (i.e., cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, etc.)\nCheckered red | With C but without B (Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb)\nPlain brown | With C and B (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\nCheckered brown | With C and B (Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested that all with C are red, and among those, any with B are brown. So:\n\n- Any bird with C is red.\n- Among those, any with B is brown.\n- Birds without C are plain.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- Plain red: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 5 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but according to my previous breakdown, there were 2 cases with Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown, and others as plain. But according to the phenotypic categories, the checkered brown would be the ones with both C and B. So, let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the breakdown was:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, no\u2014the correct breakdown is:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Cases\n---|---\nPlain red | 1 (cc BB) + 1 (cc Bb) + 1 (cc bb) = 3\nCheckered red | 2 (Cc BB) + 2 (Cc Bb) = 4\nPlain brown | 1 (CC BB) + 1 (CC Bb) + 1 (CC bb) + 1 (Cc BB) + 1 (Cc Bb) = 5\nCheckered brown | 2 (Cc BB) + 2 (Cc Bb) = 4\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+4+5+4=16, which matches the total number of F2 individuals (since each parent contributes 4 gametes, 4x4=16).\n\nSo the correct counts are:\n\n- Plain red: 3\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain brown: 5\n- Checkered brown: 4\n\nWhich sums to 16.\n\nNow, converting this to a ratio, we have 3:4:5:4.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, let's see what each option represents.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum to 16, but different numbers.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum to 16, but zero for plain brown.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 sum to 16, but higher numbers.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 sum to 16, but much higher than our counts.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 sum to 16, but lower numbers except for brown.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 all equal parts, but our counts are unequal.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 sum to 16, but way higher.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sum to 16, but again, different numbers.\n\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 sum to 16, but lower.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 sum to 12, which is wrong.\n\nOption K: None of the above.\n\nWait, none of the options match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of cases for each phenotype.\n\nLet me list each case clearly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, plain red: Cases 1, 3, 6, 7, 9 \u2192 5 cases\n\nCheckered red: Cases 4, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n\nPlain brown: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nCheckered brown: Cases 5,7 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, that changes things. So plain red: 5, checkered red:2, plain brown:1, checkered brown:2. That doesn't align with any of the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied dominance rules. Let me re-examine:\n\n- Pigment color (C): dominant \u2192 red\n- Coloration (B): dominant \u2192 brown\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Red if C is present (anywhere).\n- Brown if B is present, regardless of C.\n\n- Plain if neither C nor B is present.\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- Plain red: only when both C and B are absent \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red: when C is present but B is absent \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: when B is present regardless of C \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 5 cases\n- Checkered brown: when both C and B are present \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n\nAdding these: 3 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 12, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's off.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me list all 16 F2 individuals:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nThat's 9 cases. Wait, I thought it was 16, but only 9 listed here. Did I miss some?\n\nAh, yes! Wait, each parent produces 4 gametes, so 4x4=16 combinations. In my listing above, I only accounted for 9, missing cases 8, 7, and 9? Wait, no\u2014I listed 9 cases, but in reality, the last three (cases 7, 8, 9) are included. Wait, perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nThat's 9 cases. But 4x4=16, so 7 more cases unaccounted for. These would be:\n\n10. CC Bb \u2192 already counted as checkered brown?\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in how I categorized them.\n\nWait, perhaps I should categorize each individual individually:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n10. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n11. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n12. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n13. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n14. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n15. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n16. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Perhaps the initial breakdown was correct, and the options don't include the correct answer. Looking back, the user provided options where none seem to fit perfectly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the order is reversed. Maybe 'B' is recessive and 'b' is dominant. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nRed is dominant, C.\n\nBrown is dominant, B.\n\nYes, so C is dominant (red), B is dominant (brown).\n\nSo, the rules apply as before.\n\nRe-analyzing the F2:\n\n- Plain red: all without C (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb) \u2192 3\n- Checkered red: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 5\n- Checkered brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 3+2+5+2=12. But this contradicts the 16 expected.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all 16:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n10. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n11. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n12. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n13. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n14. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n15. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n16. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, tallying:\n\nPlain red: 1,3,6,7,11,14,16 \u2192 7 cases\nCheckered red:4,6,12 \u2192 3 cases\nPlain brown:8,15 \u2192 2 cases\nCheckered brown:5,13 \u2192 2 cases\n\nThis totals to 7+3+2+2=14, still under 16. What am I missing?\n\nAh, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red\n3. CC bb \u2192 red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red\n7. cc BB \u2192 red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 red\n10. CC Bb \u2192 brown\n11. CC bb \u2192 red\n12. Cc BB \u2192 red\n13. Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n14. cc BB \u2192 red\n15. cc Bb \u2192 brown\n16. cc bb \u2192 red\n\nNow, plain red: 1,2,3,6,7,11,12,14,16 \u2192 9 cases\n\nCheckered red:4,6,12 \u2192 3 cases\n\nPlain brown:8,15 \u2192 2 cases\n\nCheckered brown:5,13 \u2192 2 cases\n\nTotal: 9+3+2+2=16.\n\nSo the correct counts are:\n\n- Plain red:9\n- Checkered red:3\n- Plain brown:2\n- Checkered brown:2\n\nSumming to 16.\n\nNow, comparing to the options:\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 all equal, which is not the case here.\n\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but the counts are different.\n\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16, but counts differ.\n\nNone of the options seem to match this exact breakdown. However, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about dominance was incorrect.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the dominance is such that 'C' is dominant over 'c', making 'c' recessive, and 'B' is dominant over 'b'. Which is what the problem states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't strictly additive but follows a certain rule. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either pigment or color, it's brown, else red. But that's essentially what the problem describes.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option F: 4,4,4,4. But according to my calculations, that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dominance hierarchy, thinking 'C' is dominant over 'b' instead of 'c'. Let me try reversing the roles.\n\nSuppose 'c' is dominant and 'C' is recessive. But the problem explicitly states 'C' is dominant, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers 'C' as dominant for both traits, but that's unlikely. Given the problem statement, I'll proceed with the original interpretation.\n\nSince none of the options match exactly, perhaps the closest is option F:4,4,4,4, but that's not matching our count. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:5,3,2,6, even though the numbers don't match precisely. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me consider the F1 as CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes are:\n\nFrom Cc: C and c\n\nFrom Bb: B and b\n\nSo the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25%.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBB \u00d7 CcBB) selfs, the F2 would have:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n\n   - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n\n   - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- For coloration (B):\n\n   - B (dom",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes may combine into phenotypes regardless of actual gamete distribution. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a Punnett square approach where all possible combinations are considered.\n\nBut the key here is understanding that the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown\n- CC bb: Plain brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc bb: Plain brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain brown\n- cc bb: Plain red\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the F2 genotypes depend on the parents' genotypes. The parents are CcBb and CcBb. So when they self, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from Cc x Cc)\n- 25% Cc (from Cc x Cc)\n- 25% cc (from Cc x Cc)\nSimilarly for B, but since it's a dihybrid, the combination would involve both genes together. So the correct breakdown would be:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB\n- 1/4 CC Bb\n- 1/4 CC bb\n- 1/4 Cc BB\n- 1/4 Cc Bb\n- 1/4 Cc bb\n- 1/4 cc BB\n- 1/4 cc Bb\n- 1/4 cc bb\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. \n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 Red (checkered or brown?)\nWait, the initial description says:\n\n- C = dominant (red)\n- c = recessive (plain)\n\nSo, if C is present, the bird is red, otherwise plain.\n\nColoration within the same phenotype is determined by B:\n\n- B (dominant) \u2192 Brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, a bird is brown if it has at least one B allele, regardless of the C allele. If both C and B are present, it's brown. If only B is present, it's brown. Only when C is present and B is absent does it become plain.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- All birds with C (regardless of B) are red.\n- Among those, any presence of B makes them brown.\n- Those without C are plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes for F2:\n\n- Checkered red: All Cc and CcBb \u2192 1/4 (CC BB: none, CC Bb: none, CC bb: none, Cc BB: none, Cc Bb: none, Cc bb: none?) Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, the breakdown is:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB \u2192 plain red (since C is present and B is absent)\n- 1/4 CC Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- 1/4 CC bb \u2192 plain red\n- 1/4 Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n- 1/4 Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- 1/4 Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n- 1/4 cc BB \u2192 plain red\n- 1/4 cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- 1/4 cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me count each category properly.\n\nThe F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: C present (C is dominant) \u2192 red. B absent (B is recessive) \u2192 plain. So plain red.\n2. CC Bb: Same as above \u2192 plain red.\n3. CC bb: C present, B absent \u2192 plain red.\n4. Cc BB: C present \u2192 red. B present \u2192 brown.\n5. Cc Bb: C present \u2192 red. B present \u2192 brown.\n6. Cc bb: C present \u2192 red. B absent \u2192 plain.\n7. cc BB: C absent \u2192 plain. B present \u2192 brown.\n8. cc Bb: C absent \u2192 plain. B present \u2192 brown.\n9. cc bb: C and B absent \u2192 plain.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n---|---\nPlain red | All without C (i.e., cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, etc.)\nCheckered red | With C but without B (Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb)\nPlain brown | With C and B (CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\nCheckered brown | With C and B (Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested that all with C are red, and among those, any with B are brown. So:\n\n- Any bird with C is red.\n- Among those, any with B is brown.\n- Birds without C are plain.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- Plain red: cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 5 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but according to my previous breakdown, there were 2 cases with Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown, and others as plain. But according to the phenotypic categories, the checkered brown would be the ones with both C and B. So, let me recount:\n\nLooking back, the breakdown was:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, no\u2014the correct breakdown is:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Cases\n---|---\nPlain red | 1 (cc BB) + 1 (cc Bb) + 1 (cc bb) = 3\nCheckered red | 2 (Cc BB) + 2 (Cc Bb) = 4\nPlain brown | 1 (CC BB) + 1 (CC Bb) + 1 (CC bb) + 1 (Cc BB) + 1 (Cc Bb) = 5\nCheckered brown | 2 (Cc BB) + 2 (Cc Bb) = 4\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+4+5+4=16, which matches the total number of F2 individuals (since each parent contributes 4 gametes, 4x4=16).\n\nSo the correct counts are:\n\n- Plain red: 3\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain brown: 5\n- Checkered brown: 4\n\nWhich sums to 16.\n\nNow, converting this to a ratio, we have 3:4:5:4.\n\nBut looking at the options provided, let's see what each option represents.\n\nOption A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 sum to 16, but different numbers.\n\nOption B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 sum to 16, but zero for plain brown.\n\nOption C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 sum to 16, but higher numbers.\n\nOption D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 sum to 16, but much higher than our counts.\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 sum to 16, but lower numbers except for brown.\n\nOption F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 all equal parts, but our counts are unequal.\n\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 sum to 16, but way higher.\n\nOption H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 sum to 16, but again, different numbers.\n\nOption I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 sum to 16, but lower.\n\nOption J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 sum to 12, which is wrong.\n\nOption K: None of the above.\n\nWait, none of the options match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of cases for each phenotype.\n\nLet me list each case clearly:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, plain red: Cases 1, 3, 6, 7, 9 \u2192 5 cases\n\nCheckered red: Cases 4, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n\nPlain brown: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nCheckered brown: Cases 5,7 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, that changes things. So plain red: 5, checkered red:2, plain brown:1, checkered brown:2. That doesn't align with any of the given options.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied dominance rules. Let me re-examine:\n\n- Pigment color (C): dominant \u2192 red\n- Coloration (B): dominant \u2192 brown\n\nSo, a bird is:\n\n- Red if C is present (anywhere).\n- Brown if B is present, regardless of C.\n\n- Plain if neither C nor B is present.\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- Plain red: only when both C and B are absent \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered red: when C is present but B is absent \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: when B is present regardless of C \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 5 cases\n- Checkered brown: when both C and B are present \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n\nAdding these: 3 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 12, which is less than 16. Hmm, something's off.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me list all 16 F2 individuals:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nThat's 9 cases. Wait, I thought it was 16, but only 9 listed here. Did I miss some?\n\nAh, yes! Wait, each parent produces 4 gametes, so 4x4=16 combinations. In my listing above, I only accounted for 9, missing cases 8, 7, and 9? Wait, no\u2014I listed 9 cases, but in reality, the last three (cases 7, 8, 9) are included. Wait, perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nThat's 9 cases. But 4x4=16, so 7 more cases unaccounted for. These would be:\n\n10. CC Bb \u2192 already counted as checkered brown?\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in how I categorized them.\n\nWait, perhaps I should categorize each individual individually:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n10. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n11. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n12. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n13. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n14. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n15. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n16. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Perhaps the initial breakdown was correct, and the options don't include the correct answer. Looking back, the user provided options where none seem to fit perfectly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the order is reversed. Maybe 'B' is recessive and 'b' is dominant. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nRed is dominant, C.\n\nBrown is dominant, B.\n\nYes, so C is dominant (red), B is dominant (brown).\n\nSo, the rules apply as before.\n\nRe-analyzing the F2:\n\n- Plain red: all without C (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb) \u2192 3\n- Checkered red: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 5\n- Checkered brown: Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 2\n\nTotal: 3+2+5+2=12. But this contradicts the 16 expected.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all 16:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 plain red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered red\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n10. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n11. CC bb \u2192 plain red\n12. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n13. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n14. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n15. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n16. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n\nNow, tallying:\n\nPlain red: 1,3,6,7,11,14,16 \u2192 7 cases\nCheckered red:4,6,12 \u2192 3 cases\nPlain brown:8,15 \u2192 2 cases\nCheckered brown:5,13 \u2192 2 cases\n\nThis totals to 7+3+2+2=14, still under 16. What am I missing?\n\nAh, perhaps I missed some cases. Let me recount:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red\n3. CC bb \u2192 red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red\n7. cc BB \u2192 red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 red\n10. CC Bb \u2192 brown\n11. CC bb \u2192 red\n12. Cc BB \u2192 red\n13. Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n14. cc BB \u2192 red\n15. cc Bb \u2192 brown\n16. cc bb \u2192 red\n\nNow, plain red: 1,2,3,6,7,11,12,14,16 \u2192 9 cases\n\nCheckered red:4,6,12 \u2192 3 cases\n\nPlain brown:8,15 \u2192 2 cases\n\nCheckered brown:5,13 \u2192 2 cases\n\nTotal: 9+3+2+2=16.\n\nSo the correct counts are:\n\n- Plain red:9\n- Checkered red:3\n- Plain brown:2\n- Checkered brown:2\n\nSumming to 16.\n\nNow, comparing to the options:\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 all equal, which is not the case here.\n\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16, but the counts are different.\n\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16, but counts differ.\n\nNone of the options seem to match this exact breakdown. However, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about dominance was incorrect.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the dominance is such that 'C' is dominant over 'c', making 'c' recessive, and 'B' is dominant over 'b'. Which is what the problem states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic expression isn't strictly additive but follows a certain rule. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either pigment or color, it's brown, else red. But that's essentially what the problem describes.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option F: 4,4,4,4. But according to my calculations, that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the dominance hierarchy, thinking 'C' is dominant over 'b' instead of 'c'. Let me try reversing the roles.\n\nSuppose 'c' is dominant and 'C' is recessive. But the problem explicitly states 'C' is dominant, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers 'C' as dominant for both traits, but that's unlikely. Given the problem statement, I'll proceed with the original interpretation.\n\nSince none of the options match exactly, perhaps the closest is option F:4,4,4,4, but that's not matching our count. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H:5,3,2,6, even though the numbers don't match precisely. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me consider the F1 as CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. The possible gametes are:\n\nFrom Cc: C and c\n\nFrom Bb: B and b\n\nSo the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb, each at 25%.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBB \u00d7 CcBB) selfs, the F2 would have:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n\n   - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n\n   - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- For coloration (B):\n\n   - B (dom",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, since the parents are homozygous, the actual probabilities might differ.",
    "rollout": " However, since the parents are homozygous, the actual probabilities might differ. Alternatively, considering that each parent contributes either CB or cb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with equal frequency (25%) if independent assortment occurs.\n\nBut now, the question asks about the F2 generation phenotypically. To determine this, I need to look at the phenotypes based on the genotypes. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- C and B: Checkered Brown (since C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b)\n- C and b: Checkered Plain (because c is recessive)\n- c and B:Plain Brown (since c is recessive, even though B is dominant)\n- c and b:Plain Red (since both are recessive)\n\nSo, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each leading to one phenotype. Let's calculate the number of each genotype in the F2:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) selfing, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = cc BB (Plain Red)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb (Plain Red)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Actually, each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with equal probability (25%). Let me list them:\n\n1. CC BB (Checkered Red): Occurs when both parents contribute CB.\n2. Cc BB (Checkered Red): Occurs when one parent contributes CB and the other contributes cb.\n3. cc BB (Plain Red): Occurs when both parents contribute cb.\n4. cc bb (Plain Red): Occurs when both parents contribute cb.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes either CB or cb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc BB\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc BB\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nEach of these happens with a probability of 25%, assuming independent assortment. But wait, since each parent can only contribute CB or cb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (if both CB contribute)\n- Cc (if one CB and one cb contribute)\n- cc (if both cb contribute)\n- bb (if both cb contribute)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (Checkered Red): Phenotype is Checkered Red\n- Cc (Checkered Red): Same as above\n- cc (Plain Red): Phenotype is Plain Red\n- bb (Plain Red): Phenotype is Plain Red\n\nWait, but how many of each genotype do we expect? If the parents are homozygous, then the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered Red)\n- 25% Cc (Checkered Red)\n- 25% cc (Plain Red)\n- 25% bb (Plain Red)\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratios would be 25% Checkered Red, 25% Checkered Red, 25% Plain Red, 25% Plain Red. Combining the Checkered Red ones together, we get 50% Checkered Red and 50% Plain Red.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide specific phenotypic ratios. Option G says 12 Checkered Red, 2 Plain Red, etc., which seems way off. Option D has 1 Checkered Red, 3 Plain Red, which also doesn't fit. Option E suggests 3 Checkered Red, 9 Plain Red, which still doesn't add up. Option J states 2 Checkered Red, 6 Plain Red, which isn't matching. Option F says 4 each, which is closer to half each, but not exactly. Option C mentions 9 Checkered Red, 3 Plain Red, which is three times what I calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. When the F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider the F2 as having four possible genotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. But in reality, because each parent can only contribute CB or cb, the F2 will have:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for the other traits. Wait, no\u2014this is where I got confused earlier. Because the F1 is CcBb, so when crossing with itself, the segregation is based on each gene independently. So for the B gene, C is dominant, c recessive. For the B gene, the F1 is Cc, so the gametes are 50% CB and 50% cb. Similarly for the B gene in the other parent. So the F2 will have:\n\nFor the B gene:\n- 25% C (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% C (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% c (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nSimilarly for the B gene. So for the B trait:\n\n- 25% Checkered Brown (C and B)\n- 50% Checkered Plain (C and c)\n- 25% Brown (c and B)\n- 0% None (but this is impossible)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that for each gene separately, the F2 will have:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- 25% C (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% c (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% c (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nFor the B gene:\n- 25% B (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% b (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% b (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nSince these genes assort independently, the combined phenotypes are products of these probabilities. So the F2 phenotypic ratio is determined by multiplying the probabilities of each gene combination.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that for each trait, the F2 will have:\n\n- For the C gene:\n  - 25% C (Checkered)\n  - 75% c (Plain)\n- For the B gene:\n  - 25% B (Brown)\n  - 75% b (Plain)\n  \nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is the product of these probabilities. So for each phenotype, we multiply the probabilities of the dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_):\n   - 25% for C_\n   - 25% for B_\n   - Combined: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, it's the product of the probabilities for each dominant allele. Since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the phenotype, the overall probability is:\n\nProbability = (prob of C_) * (prob of B_)\n= 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nBut wait, this isn't correct because the probabilities aren't additive. Instead, it's the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene being dominant.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of counts: if there are 16 possible F2 genotypes (since each gene has 4 possibilities), the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C_ and B_: Checkered Brown (25%)\n- C_ and b_: Checkered Plain (25%)\n- c_ and B_: Plain Brown (25%)\n- c_ and b_: Plain Red (25%)\n\nThus, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time in the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but scaled according to dominance. However, checking the options, none of them reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is F, which says 4 each, implying a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all phenotypes equally. But looking at the options, option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, totaling 16. That fits our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. In the F2 generation, each of the four phenotypes would occur 25% of the time, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. So each phenotype would have 4 individuals (assuming a total of 16 offspring). Thus, option F matches this scenario, stating a phenotypic ratio of 4 each.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, since the parents are homozygous, the actual probabilities might differ. Alternatively, considering that each parent contributes either CB or cb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with equal frequency (25%) if independent assortment occurs.\n\nBut now, the question asks about the F2 generation phenotypically. To determine this, I need to look at the phenotypes based on the genotypes. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- C and B: Checkered Brown (since C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b)\n- C and b: Checkered Plain (because c is recessive)\n- c and B:Plain Brown (since c is recessive, even though B is dominant)\n- c and b:Plain Red (since both are recessive)\n\nSo, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each leading to one phenotype. Let's calculate the number of each genotype in the F2:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) selfing, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n- cb \u00d7 CB = cc BB (Plain Red)\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb (Plain Red)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't seem right. Actually, each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with equal probability (25%). Let me list them:\n\n1. CC BB (Checkered Red): Occurs when both parents contribute CB.\n2. Cc BB (Checkered Red): Occurs when one parent contributes CB and the other contributes cb.\n3. cc BB (Plain Red): Occurs when both parents contribute cb.\n4. cc bb (Plain Red): Occurs when both parents contribute cb.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each parent contributes either CB or cb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc BB\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc BB\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nEach of these happens with a probability of 25%, assuming independent assortment. But wait, since each parent can only contribute CB or cb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n- CC (if both CB contribute)\n- Cc (if one CB and one cb contribute)\n- cc (if both cb contribute)\n- bb (if both cb contribute)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (Checkered Red): Phenotype is Checkered Red\n- Cc (Checkered Red): Same as above\n- cc (Plain Red): Phenotype is Plain Red\n- bb (Plain Red): Phenotype is Plain Red\n\nWait, but how many of each genotype do we expect? If the parents are homozygous, then the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (Checkered Red)\n- 25% Cc (Checkered Red)\n- 25% cc (Plain Red)\n- 25% bb (Plain Red)\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratios would be 25% Checkered Red, 25% Checkered Red, 25% Plain Red, 25% Plain Red. Combining the Checkered Red ones together, we get 50% Checkered Red and 50% Plain Red.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide specific phenotypic ratios. Option G says 12 Checkered Red, 2 Plain Red, etc., which seems way off. Option D has 1 Checkered Red, 3 Plain Red, which also doesn't fit. Option E suggests 3 Checkered Red, 9 Plain Red, which still doesn't add up. Option J states 2 Checkered Red, 6 Plain Red, which isn't matching. Option F says 4 each, which is closer to half each, but not exactly. Option C mentions 9 Checkered Red, 3 Plain Red, which is three times what I calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. When the F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider the F2 as having four possible genotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. But in reality, because each parent can only contribute CB or cb, the F2 will have:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd similarly for the other traits. Wait, no\u2014this is where I got confused earlier. Because the F1 is CcBb, so when crossing with itself, the segregation is based on each gene independently. So for the B gene, C is dominant, c recessive. For the B gene, the F1 is Cc, so the gametes are 50% CB and 50% cb. Similarly for the B gene in the other parent. So the F2 will have:\n\nFor the B gene:\n- 25% C (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% C (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% c (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nSimilarly for the B gene. So for the B trait:\n\n- 25% Checkered Brown (C and B)\n- 50% Checkered Plain (C and c)\n- 25% Brown (c and B)\n- 0% None (but this is impossible)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that for each gene separately, the F2 will have:\n\nFor the C gene:\n- 25% C (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% c (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% c (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nFor the B gene:\n- 25% B (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 50% b (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% b (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nSince these genes assort independently, the combined phenotypes are products of these probabilities. So the F2 phenotypic ratio is determined by multiplying the probabilities of each gene combination.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that for each trait, the F2 will have:\n\n- For the C gene:\n  - 25% C (Checkered)\n  - 75% c (Plain)\n- For the B gene:\n  - 25% B (Brown)\n  - 75% b (Plain)\n  \nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio is the product of these probabilities. So for each phenotype, we multiply the probabilities of the dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_):\n   - 25% for C_\n   - 25% for B_\n   - Combined: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, it's the product of the probabilities for each dominant allele. Since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the phenotype, the overall probability is:\n\nProbability = (prob of C_) * (prob of B_)\n= 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nBut wait, this isn't correct because the probabilities aren't additive. Instead, it's the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene being dominant.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of counts: if there are 16 possible F2 genotypes (since each gene has 4 possibilities), the phenotypes would be:\n\n- C_ and B_: Checkered Brown (25%)\n- C_ and b_: Checkered Plain (25%)\n- c_ and B_: Plain Brown (25%)\n- c_ and b_: Plain Red (25%)\n\nThus, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time in the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but scaled according to dominance. However, checking the options, none of them reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest option is F, which says 4 each, implying a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all phenotypes equally. But looking at the options, option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4, totaling 16. That fits our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. In the F2 generation, each of the four phenotypes would occur 25% of the time, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. So each phenotype would have 4 individuals (assuming a total of 16 offspring). Thus, option F matches this scenario, stating a phenotypic ratio of 4 each.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would have the following genotypes:",
    "rollout": " However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB (probability 25%)\n- Bb (probability 50%)\n- bb (probability 25%)\n\nSo the combination of these would lead to 9 possible genotypic combinations in the F2 generation. But the question asks specifically about phenotypes, which depend on the alleles present. So let's map this.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigmentation (Red/Brown):\n  - Dominant C \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n- Color (Checkered/Plain):\n  - Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n- Pigment: C dominant (red), c recessive (plain)\n- Color: B dominant (brown), b recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, for a bird to be checkered, it must have genotype cc BB (since B is dominant). To be plain brown, it needs to be bb BB or BB bb? Wait, no. Wait, the phenotype depends on both genes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotype for pigment is determined by gene C, and the phenotype for color is determined by gene B. They are independent traits, so the presence of C affects pigment, and B affects color. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes.\n\nSo, for pigment:\n- If C is present (either C or C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain.\n\nFor color:\n- If B is present (either B or B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nTherefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has any dominant alleles for either gene.\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation:\n\nFirst, list all possible genotypes in the F2:\n\nGene C:\n- CC: probability 25%\n- Cc: probability 50%\n- cc: probability 25%\n\nGene B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut since both genes are segregating independently, the F2 will have all combinations. However, some genotypes may overlap in terms of phenotype.\n\nLet's list the possible phenotypes and count how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nPossible Phenotypes:\n1. Checkered red (cc BB): Both genes recessive.\n2. Checkered brown (cc Bb): c present, B absent.\n3. Plain red (cc bb): c present, B absent.\n4. Plain brown (cc BB?) Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nActually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: genotype cc (for B) and BB (for C). So cc BB.\n\n- Plain red: genotype cc (B is dominant, so red regardless of B).\n\n- Checkered brown: genotype cc Bb (so c present, B present).\n\n- Plain brown: genotype cc bb (c present, B absent).\n\nSimilarly, if B is present regardless of c, then:\n\n- Red (any cc or cc bb) regardless of B.\n\nWait, no, let me approach differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has any dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nSo:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C (C_), it is red.\n\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for B (B_), it is brown.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So the bird will be:\n\n- Red (and/or brown) if it has at least one dominant C or B.\n\n- Brown (and/or red) if it has at least one dominant B or C.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n\n  - C_: red\n\n  - c_: plain\n\n- For color (B):\n\n  - B_: brown\n\n  - b_: checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of both:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant C (C_), and at least one dominant B (B_), it's red brown (both traits present).\n\n- If it has at least one dominant C, but not B (b_), it's red checkered.\n\n- If it has at least one dominant B, but not C (c_), it's brown plain.\n\n- If it has neither dominant C nor B (cc bb), it's plain brown.\n\nWait, but no\u2014if a bird has C (C_), it doesn't matter what B is; it's red. Similarly, if it has B, it's brown. So the correct way to calculate phenotypes is:\n\n- Checkered: genotype is cc (for B) and bb (for C). So cc bb.\n\n- Plain red: genotype is cc (B is irrelevant since it's recessive) and bb (C is irrelevant since it's recessive). So cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right. Wait, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- A bird is checkered if it has at least one recessive allele for both B and C?\n\nNo, that's not accurate. Wait, the definition is:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (cc for B and bb for C). So cc bb.\n\n- Plain red: any genotype where C is present (C_) regardless of B.\n\n- Checkered brown: any genotype where B is present (B_) regardless of C.\n\n- Plain brown: any genotype where B is recessive (bb) and C is recessive (cc). So cc bb.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me try another approach. Maybe it's better to consider the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: red, brown (C and B dominant)\n2. CC Bb: red, brown (C dominant, B present)\n3. CC bb: red, brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n4. Cc BB: red, brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n5. Cc Bb: red, brown (C dominant, B present)\n6. Cc bb: red, brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n7. cc BB: red, brown (c, B dominant)\n8. cc Bb: red, brown (c, B present)\n9. cc bb: red, brown (c, B recessive)\n\nWait, this approach counts all possible phenotypes as red brown, which isn't helpful. Instead, let's categorize based on dominance.\n\nAnother method: For each trait, determine presence or absence:\n\n- Pigment (C): dominant = red, recessive = plain\n\n- Color (B): dominant = brown, recessive = checkered\n\nSo a bird is:\n\n- Checkered if it has checkered for both traits (i.e., cc for B and bb for C). So cc bb.\n\n- Plain red if it has red for pigment (C present) and any color for color (B can be B_ or b_).\n\n- Checkered brown if it has brown for color (B present) and any color for pigment (C can be C_ or c_).\n\n- Plain brown if it has brown for color (B present) and red for pigment (C recessive).\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has B present (B_), regardless of C, it's brown. Similarly, if C is present, regardless of B, it's red. So:\n\n- Checkered: both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb.\n\n- Plain red: any C present (C_ ), regardless of B.\n\n- Checkered brown: any B present (B_ ), regardless of C.\n\n- Plain brown: any B present and any C present (B_ and C_ )? Wait, no\u2014if a bird has B present (B_ ), regardless of C, it's brown. Similarly, if it has C present (C_ ), regardless of B, it's red. So the only case where it's plain brown is when both B and C are recessive (cc bb). Because:\n\n- If B is present (B_), regardless of C, it's brown.\n\n- If C is present (C_), regardless of B, it's red.\n\n- If both are recessive, it's neither.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb.\n\n- Plain red: C_ (regardless of B) \u2192 includes all cases except cc bb.\n\n- Checkered brown: B_ (regardless of C) \u2192 includes all cases except cc bb.\n\n- Plain brown: Only when both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb.\n\nWait, no! That can't be right because if a bird is B_ and C_, it's brown. But according to the previous logic, it would be brown. However, if a bird is B_ and C is recessive (c), it's brown. Similarly, if it's C_ and B is recessive, it's red.\n\nBut if both are recessive, it's neither, which is checkered brown. Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nBird | Pigment (C) | Color (B) | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n1 | C_ | B_ | Brown\n2 | C_ | b_ | Red\n3 | c_ | B_ | Checkered brown\n4 | c_ | b_ | Checkered\n5 | C_ | B_ | Brown\n6 | C_ | b_ | Red\n7 | c_ | B_ | Checkered brown\n8 | c_ | b_ | Checkered\n9 | C_ | B_ | Brown\n10 | C_ | b_ | Red\n11 | c_ | B_ | Checkered brown\n12 | c_ | b_ | Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach leads to multiple entries under \"Brown\" and \"Red.\" This might be causing confusion. Perhaps a better way is to note that:\n\n- All birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Brown and Red (but since C and B are separate, it's both present \u2192 Brown and Red). Wait, no\u2014it's brown if B is present, regardless of C. And red if C is present, regardless of B. So the only bird that is neither brown nor red is when both B and C are recessive. Thus:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\n- Plain red: Any bird with C present \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\n- Checkered brown: Any bird with B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\n- Plain brown: Any bird with B present and C present? Wait, no. Wait, if a bird has B present (B_), regardless of C, it's brown. Similarly, if it has C present (C_), regardless of B, it's red. So:\n\n- If a bird has B present (B_), it's brown.\n\n- If a bird has C present (C_), it's red.\n\n- If a bird has both B and C present (B_ and C_), it's brown.\n\n- If a bird has neither (cc bb), it's checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that would mean that:\n\n- Any bird with B_ \u2192 brown (including those with C_ )\n\n- Any bird with C_ \u2192 red (including those with B_ )\n\n- Any bird with both B_ and C_ \u2192 brown\n\n- Any bird with neither \u2192 checkered\n\nBut that's overlapping. For example, a bird could be both B_ and C_, which would still be brown. So the phenotypes can be summarized as:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\n- Plain red: C_ \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\n- Plain brown: B_ \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\nBecause:\n\n- If a bird has B_ (brown), regardless of C, it's brown.\n\n- If a bird has C_ (red), regardless of B, it's red.\n\n- If a bird has both B_ and C_, it's brown (since B_ takes precedence over C_).\n\n- If a bird has neither, it's checkered.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has B_ (brown) or C_ (red). If both are present, it's brown. If only one is present, it's the respective color. If neither is present, it's checkered.\n\nSo now, let's compute the number of F2 birds in each category.\n\nIn the F2 generation, there are nine possible genotypic combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Red (because C_ is present)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach groups them incorrectly. Let's instead look at the phenotypic categories directly.\n\n- Checkered: only when both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\n- Plain red: any bird with C_ \u2192 C_ (any B). In F2, the proportion of C_ is:\n\n  - From F1: Cc (which is 50% C_, 50% cc)\n\n  - Plus cc (25% cc)\n\n  Total C_ = 50% + 25% = 75%, but wait, the F2 genotypic probabilities are different. Actually, in the F2, each trait is inherited independently, so the probability of having at least one dominant allele for C is 75% (since 25% is cc), same for B. But since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of being red (at least C_ ) and brown (at least B_ ) is 100%. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to realize that in F2:\n\n- The probability of having at least one C (C_) is 3/4.\n\n- The probability of having at least one B (B_) is 3/4.\n\nSince these are independent, the probability of having at least one C and at least one B is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because the events are not mutually exclusive. Alternatively, the probability of having at least one C OR at least one B is 1 - probability of neither. Probability of neither C_ nor B_ is (probability cc for C) * (probability bb for B) = (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. So probability of at least one C OR at least one B is 15/16. But that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, going back to the phenotypic categories:\n\n- Checkered: only when both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 frequency is 1/16.\n\n- Plain red: any bird with C_ \u2192 which includes C_ bb and C_ B_. The probability of C_ is 3/4, and within that, how much is B_? Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When F1 x F1 occurs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n\n- CC Bb (25%)\n\n- CC bb (25%)\n\n- Cc BB (25%)\n\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n\n- Cc bb (25%)\n\n- cc BB (25%)\n\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, let's classify each genotype into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red (C_ and B_ \u2192 Phenotype: Red)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red (C_ and B present \u2192 Phenotype: Red)\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red (C_ and B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Red)\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown (C_ and B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown)\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown (C_ and B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown)\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown (C_ and B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Brown)\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered (B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered)\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (B present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered)\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered (Neither B nor C present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red: Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 cases\n\n- Brown: Cases 4, 5, 6 \u2192 3 cases\n\n- Checkered: Cases 7, 8, 9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9, which matches the total of 9 F2 birds. But this suggests that each phenotype accounts for exactly one-third of the population. However, looking back, that doesn't seem right because in reality, the distribution shouldn't be uniform unless the traits are completely independent and equally likely. Let me double-check my classification.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in classifying the phenotypes. Let me go through each case again:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 B present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Neither \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Red: Cases 1, 3, 6 \u2192 3\n\n- Brown: Cases 2, 4, 5 \u2192 3\n\n- Checkered: Cases 7, 8, 9 \u2192 3\n\nThis totals 9 birds, which is correct. However, this suggests that each phenotype is equally represented, which contradicts my earlier assumption because I thought that depending on the alleles, the phenotypes might vary more. Wait, but in this case, each bird's phenotype is determined solely by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait, leading to three distinct phenotypes, each with 3/9 = 1/3 representation.\n\nBut looking at the options given, none of them match this scenario because option G is 12 checkered, 2 plain brown, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic categories. Let me reconsider the definitions:\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to recognize",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor Gene B:\n- BB (probability 25%)\n- Bb (probability 50%)\n- bb (probability 25%)\n\nSo the combination of these would lead to 9 possible genotypic combinations in the F2 generation. But the question asks specifically about phenotypes, which depend on the alleles present. So let's map this.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigmentation (Red/Brown):\n  - Dominant C \u2192 Red\n  - Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n- Color (Checkered/Plain):\n  - Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n- Pigment: C dominant (red), c recessive (plain)\n- Color: B dominant (brown), b recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, for a bird to be checkered, it must have genotype cc BB (since B is dominant). To be plain brown, it needs to be bb BB or BB bb? Wait, no. Wait, the phenotype depends on both genes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotype for pigment is determined by gene C, and the phenotype for color is determined by gene B. They are independent traits, so the presence of C affects pigment, and B affects color. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes.\n\nSo, for pigment:\n- If C is present (either C or C_), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (c_), the bird is plain.\n\nFor color:\n- If B is present (either B or B_), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (b_), the bird is checkered.\n\nTherefore, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has any dominant alleles for either gene.\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation:\n\nFirst, list all possible genotypes in the F2:\n\nGene C:\n- CC: probability 25%\n- Cc: probability 50%\n- cc: probability 25%\n\nGene B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut since both genes are segregating independently, the F2 will have all combinations. However, some genotypes may overlap in terms of phenotype.\n\nLet's list the possible phenotypes and count how many F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nPossible Phenotypes:\n1. Checkered red (cc BB): Both genes recessive.\n2. Checkered brown (cc Bb): c present, B absent.\n3. Plain red (cc bb): c present, B absent.\n4. Plain brown (cc BB?) Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nActually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered: genotype cc (for B) and BB (for C). So cc BB.\n\n- Plain red: genotype cc (B is dominant, so red regardless of B).\n\n- Checkered brown: genotype cc Bb (so c present, B present).\n\n- Plain brown: genotype cc bb (c present, B absent).\n\nSimilarly, if B is present regardless of c, then:\n\n- Red (any cc or cc bb) regardless of B.\n\nWait, no, let me approach differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has any dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nSo:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C (C_), it is red.\n\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for B (B_), it is brown.\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So the bird will be:\n\n- Red (and/or brown) if it has at least one dominant C or B.\n\n- Brown (and/or red) if it has at least one dominant B or C.\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n\n  - C_: red\n\n  - c_: plain\n\n- For color (B):\n\n  - B_: brown\n\n  - b_: checkered\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of both:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant C (C_), and at least one dominant B (B_), it's red brown (both traits present).\n\n- If it has at least one dominant C, but not B (b_), it's red checkered.\n\n- If it has at least one dominant B, but not C (c_), it's brown plain.\n\n- If it has neither dominant C nor B (cc bb), it's plain brown.\n\nWait, but no\u2014if a bird has C (C_), it doesn't matter what B is; it's red. Similarly, if it has B, it's brown. So the correct way to calculate phenotypes is:\n\n- Checkered: genotype is cc (for B) and bb (for C). So cc bb.\n\n- Plain red: genotype is cc (B is irrelevant since it's recessive) and bb (C is irrelevant since it's recessive). So cc bb.\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right. Wait, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- A bird is checkered if it has at least one recessive allele for both B and C?\n\nNo, that's not accurate. Wait, the definition is:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (cc for B and bb for C). So cc bb.\n\n- Plain red: any genotype where C is present (C_) regardless of B.\n\n- Checkered brown: any genotype where B is present (B_) regardless of C.\n\n- Plain brown: any genotype where B is recessive (bb) and C is recessive (cc). So cc bb.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me try another approach. Maybe it's better to consider the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nPossible Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: red, brown (C and B dominant)\n2. CC Bb: red, brown (C dominant, B present)\n3. CC bb: red, brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n4. Cc BB: red, brown (C dominant, B dominant)\n5. Cc Bb: red, brown (C dominant, B present)\n6. Cc bb: red, brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n7. cc BB: red, brown (c, B dominant)\n8. cc Bb: red, brown (c, B present)\n9. cc bb: red, brown (c, B recessive)\n\nWait, this approach counts all possible phenotypes as red brown, which isn't helpful. Instead, let's categorize based on dominance.\n\nAnother method: For each trait, determine presence or absence:\n\n- Pigment (C): dominant = red, recessive = plain\n\n- Color (B): dominant = brown, recessive = checkered\n\nSo a bird is:\n\n- Checkered if it has checkered for both traits (i.e., cc for B and bb for C). So cc bb.\n\n- Plain red if it has red for pigment (C present) and any color for color (B can be B_ or b_).\n\n- Checkered brown if it has brown for color (B present) and any color for pigment (C can be C_ or c_).\n\n- Plain brown if it has brown for color (B present) and red for pigment (C recessive).\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has B present (B_), regardless of C, it's brown. Similarly, if C is present, regardless of B, it's red. So:\n\n- Checkered: both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb.\n\n- Plain red: any C present (C_ ), regardless of B.\n\n- Checkered brown: any B present (B_ ), regardless of C.\n\n- Plain brown: any B present and any C present (B_ and C_ )? Wait, no\u2014if a bird has B present (B_ ), regardless of C, it's brown. Similarly, if it has C present (C_ ), regardless of B, it's red. So the only case where it's plain brown is when both B and C are recessive (cc bb). Because:\n\n- If B is present (B_), regardless of C, it's brown.\n\n- If C is present (C_), regardless of B, it's red.\n\n- If both are recessive, it's neither.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb.\n\n- Plain red: C_ (regardless of B) \u2192 includes all cases except cc bb.\n\n- Checkered brown: B_ (regardless of C) \u2192 includes all cases except cc bb.\n\n- Plain brown: Only when both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb.\n\nWait, no! That can't be right because if a bird is B_ and C_, it's brown. But according to the previous logic, it would be brown. However, if a bird is B_ and C is recessive (c), it's brown. Similarly, if it's C_ and B is recessive, it's red.\n\nBut if both are recessive, it's neither, which is checkered brown. Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nBird | Pigment (C) | Color (B) | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n1 | C_ | B_ | Brown\n2 | C_ | b_ | Red\n3 | c_ | B_ | Checkered brown\n4 | c_ | b_ | Checkered\n5 | C_ | B_ | Brown\n6 | C_ | b_ | Red\n7 | c_ | B_ | Checkered brown\n8 | c_ | b_ | Checkered\n9 | C_ | B_ | Brown\n10 | C_ | b_ | Red\n11 | c_ | B_ | Checkered brown\n12 | c_ | b_ | Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach leads to multiple entries under \"Brown\" and \"Red.\" This might be causing confusion. Perhaps a better way is to note that:\n\n- All birds with at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Brown and Red (but since C and B are separate, it's both present \u2192 Brown and Red). Wait, no\u2014it's brown if B is present, regardless of C. And red if C is present, regardless of B. So the only bird that is neither brown nor red is when both B and C are recessive. Thus:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\n- Plain red: Any bird with C present \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\n- Checkered brown: Any bird with B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\n- Plain brown: Any bird with B present and C present? Wait, no. Wait, if a bird has B present (B_), regardless of C, it's brown. Similarly, if it has C present (C_), regardless of B, it's red. So:\n\n- If a bird has B present (B_), it's brown.\n\n- If a bird has C present (C_), it's red.\n\n- If a bird has both B and C present (B_ and C_), it's brown.\n\n- If a bird has neither (cc bb), it's checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that would mean that:\n\n- Any bird with B_ \u2192 brown (including those with C_ )\n\n- Any bird with C_ \u2192 red (including those with B_ )\n\n- Any bird with both B_ and C_ \u2192 brown\n\n- Any bird with neither \u2192 checkered\n\nBut that's overlapping. For example, a bird could be both B_ and C_, which would still be brown. So the phenotypes can be summarized as:\n\n- Checkered: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\n- Plain red: C_ \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\n- Plain brown: B_ \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\nBecause:\n\n- If a bird has B_ (brown), regardless of C, it's brown.\n\n- If a bird has C_ (red), regardless of B, it's red.\n\n- If a bird has both B_ and C_, it's brown (since B_ takes precedence over C_).\n\n- If a bird has neither, it's checkered.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has B_ (brown) or C_ (red). If both are present, it's brown. If only one is present, it's the respective color. If neither is present, it's checkered.\n\nSo now, let's compute the number of F2 birds in each category.\n\nIn the F2 generation, there are nine possible genotypic combinations:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Red (because C_ is present)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach groups them incorrectly. Let's instead look at the phenotypic categories directly.\n\n- Checkered: only when both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\n- Plain red: any bird with C_ \u2192 C_ (any B). In F2, the proportion of C_ is:\n\n  - From F1: Cc (which is 50% C_, 50% cc)\n\n  - Plus cc (25% cc)\n\n  Total C_ = 50% + 25% = 75%, but wait, the F2 genotypic probabilities are different. Actually, in the F2, each trait is inherited independently, so the probability of having at least one dominant allele for C is 75% (since 25% is cc), same for B. But since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of being red (at least C_ ) and brown (at least B_ ) is 100%. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to realize that in F2:\n\n- The probability of having at least one C (C_) is 3/4.\n\n- The probability of having at least one B (B_) is 3/4.\n\nSince these are independent, the probability of having at least one C and at least one B is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because the events are not mutually exclusive. Alternatively, the probability of having at least one C OR at least one B is 1 - probability of neither. Probability of neither C_ nor B_ is (probability cc for C) * (probability bb for B) = (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. So probability of at least one C OR at least one B is 15/16. But that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, going back to the phenotypic categories:\n\n- Checkered: only when both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb \u2192 frequency is 1/16.\n\n- Plain red: any bird with C_ \u2192 which includes C_ bb and C_ B_. The probability of C_ is 3/4, and within that, how much is B_? Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When F1 x F1 occurs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n\n- CC Bb (25%)\n\n- CC bb (25%)\n\n- Cc BB (25%)\n\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n\n- Cc bb (25%)\n\n- cc BB (25%)\n\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, let's classify each genotype into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red (C_ and B_ \u2192 Phenotype: Red)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red (C_ and B present \u2192 Phenotype: Red)\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red (C_ and B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Red)\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown (C_ and B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown)\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown (C_ and B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown)\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Brown (C_ and B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Brown)\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered (B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered)\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered (B present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered)\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered (Neither B nor C present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red: Cases 1, 2, 3 \u2192 3 cases\n\n- Brown: Cases 4, 5, 6 \u2192 3 cases\n\n- Checkered: Cases 7, 8, 9 \u2192 3 cases\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9, which matches the total of 9 F2 birds. But this suggests that each phenotype accounts for exactly one-third of the population. However, looking back, that doesn't seem right because in reality, the distribution shouldn't be uniform unless the traits are completely independent and equally likely. Let me double-check my classification.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in classifying the phenotypes. Let me go through each case again:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Both dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype: Brown\n\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Red\n\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 B absent \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 B present \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Neither \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Red: Cases 1, 3, 6 \u2192 3\n\n- Brown: Cases 2, 4, 5 \u2192 3\n\n- Checkered: Cases 7, 8, 9 \u2192 3\n\nThis totals 9 birds, which is correct. However, this suggests that each phenotype is equally represented, which contradicts my earlier assumption because I thought that depending on the alleles, the phenotypes might vary more. Wait, but in this case, each bird's phenotype is determined solely by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each trait, leading to three distinct phenotypes, each with 3/9 = 1/3 representation.\n\nBut looking at the options given, none of them match this scenario because option G is 12 checkered, 2 plain brown, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic categories.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes may not be expressed as phenotypes. So the phenotypes depend on whether the combination of C/c and B/b results in a particular trait.

Therefore, the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But let me confirm if that applies here.\n\nHowever, the actual phenotypes depend on how the alleles interact. For example, a bird could be CC BB (red-brown), CC Bb (red-brown), CC bb (red-checkered), Cc BB (pale-red-brown), etc. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait independently. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either C or B will express the corresponding phenotype. But the exact interaction might vary.\n\nAlternatively, considering that both genes are dominant, the phenotypes could be determined as follows:\n\n- If C is present (either C or cc), then regardless of B, it's red.\n- If B is present (either B or bb), then regardless of C, it's brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (cc and bb), it's plain.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because each gene contributes to the overall color. Alternatively, perhaps the expression combines both traits. Maybe the bird's color depends on both genes. For instance, if the bird is CC BB, it's red-brown. If it's CC Bb, it's red-brown. CC bb is red-checkered, Cc BB is pale red-brown, Cc Bb is pale red-brown, and so on.\n\nThis is getting complex. Perhaps a better way is to determine the phenotypic ratio by considering all possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pale Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pale Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pale Plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nNow, count the number of each type:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (CC Bb)\n- Checkered Plain: 1 (CC bb)\n- Pale Red: 2 (Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Pale Plain: 1 (Cc bb)\n- Plain Brown: 1 (cc BB)\n- Plain Red: 1 (cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 1 (cc Bb)\n- Plain Plain: 1 (cc bb)\n\nSo the counts are:\n\nCheckered Red: 1\nCheckered Brown: 2\nCheckered Plain: 1\nPale Red: 2\nPale Plain: 1\nPlain Brown: 1\nPlain Red: 1\nPlain Brown: 1\nPlain Plain: 1\n\nAdding them up: 1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1+1=10. Hmm, that adds up to 10, but the options don't include 10. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the individual birds are counted as F2, so each gamete is from a F1, which is CcBb. When F1 selfs, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: Cc Bb (twice, once for each order)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo there are three distinct genotypes: CC BB, Cc Bb (two copies), and cc bb.\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pale Red (since C is present)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nEach of these occurs in proportion based on the gametes. The probabilities are:\n\n- CC BB: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n- Cc Bb: 2*(1/2)*(1/2)=1/2\n- cc bb: (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes and their proportions are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Pale Red: 1/2 \u2192 50%\n- Plain: 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nNow, applying the phenotypes based on the rules:\n\n- Checkered Red: Always Checkered Red\n- Pale Red: Always Pale Red\n- Plain: Always Plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, with Checkered Red being the most frequent, followed by Pale Red, and Plain being the least frequent.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That doesn't match my current understanding. Option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which also doesn't fit. Option A is \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" \u2013 still not matching. Option J is \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 closer. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 no. Option F is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2013 same as J. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the F2 proportions.\n\nWait, earlier I thought F2 genotypes were 1/4 each, leading to 25% Checkered Red, 50% Pale Red, 25% Plain. But looking back, I see that in the original F2 description, there are 4 genotypes: 1 Checkered Red, 2 Pale Red, 1 Plain, 1 Pale Red again, and 1 Plain. Wait, perhaps I overcounted. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the F2 set given:\n\nGametes: (CB) (cb)\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2 gametes: (CB)(cb)(cB)(cb)\n\nSo F2 would be:\n\n- CB + CB: CC BB\n- CB + cb: Cc Bb\n- cb + CB: Cc Bb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo four possible genotypes: 1 CC BB, 2 Cc Bb, 1 cc bb.\n\nTherefore, proportions:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: 2/4 \u2192 50% \u2192 Pale Red\n- cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1. Applying the dominance hierarchy, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Red (always present)\n- Pale Red (present if C is present)\n- Plain (only if both alleles are recessive for both genes)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, with Checkered Red being the most common, followed by Pale Red, and Plain being the least.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match this. However, option J states \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of dominant B makes the bird brown, overriding the C. So:\n\nIf B is present, the bird is brown. Otherwise, it's red. Similarly, if C is present, it's red; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait:\n\n- Brown (B) overrides red (C)\n- Plain (c) overrides brown (B)\n- Checkered (b) overrides both\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Brown (if B is present)\n2. Checkered (if b and c)\n3. Plain (if c and b)\n\nGiven that, let's reevaluate the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red \u2192 Red, but since B is present, it's brown?\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe hierarchy is such that the presence of dominant B makes the bird brown, overriding the presence of dominant c. Similarly, the presence of dominant c makes it plain, overriding the presence of dominant B.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- If both B and c are present (i.e., B is dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If C is present (dominant), regardless of B, it's red.\n- If neither C nor B is present, it's plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be determined as:\n\n1. Brown (if B is dominant)\n2. Red (if C is dominant)\n3. Plain (if neither)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the frequency of each condition.\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n2. Cc BB \u2192 C is present \u2192 Red\n3. CC Bb \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n5. CC bb \u2192 B is absent (since b is recessive) \u2192 Plain\n6. Cc bb \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 C is absent \u2192 Plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Neither \u2192 Plain\n\nCounting the instances where each phenotype occurs:\n\n- Brown: Cases 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 6 cases\n- Red: Case 2 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain: Cases 5,7 \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Brown:Red:Plain = 6:1:2.\n\nBut the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, possibly including all phenotypes. However, the options provided do not include 6:1:2. Instead, the closest is option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio based on all possible combinations, not just dominance. But according to the hierarchy I've established, the ratio would be 6:1:2, but the options don't reflect that exactly. Looking at the options:\n\nOption J is \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2014 Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting dominance. Let me double-check.\n\nAnother approach: The dominance hierarchy could mean that if B is present, the bird is brown, overriding red. If C is present, red overrides brown. If neither is present, it's plain.\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n- If B is present (B_), it's brown.\n- Else, if C is present (C_), it's red.\n- Else, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as:\n\n1. Brown\n2. Red\n3. Plain\n\nThe frequencies of these phenotypes are based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown occurs in cases 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 7 cases\n- Red occurs in case 4 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain occurs in cases 3,7 \u2192 2 cases\n\nThus, the ratio is 7:1:2. Again, none of the options match this except option J, which suggests a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that if both B and b are present, the bird is brown, overriding the effect of C. So, the presence of B overrides C, making the bird brown unless C is present, in which case it's red unless B is present, in which case it's plain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me refer back to the initial F2 analysis. In the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But under the dominance hierarchy, some categories combine. Given that B is dominant over b and C is dominant over c, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Brown (B_: always brown)\n- Red (C_: always red)\n- Checkered (bb and cc): but wait, in the hierarchy, checkered would be when neither B nor C is dominant, i.e., when both alleles are recessive. But in reality, the hierarchy goes from B to C to checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is such that:\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If neither B nor C is present (both recessive), the bird is checkered.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because checkered is usually recessive, while brown and red are dominant. Alternatively, perhaps the hierarchy is:\n\n- Brown (B_) \u2192 overrides red (C_)\n- Red (Cc) \u2192 overrides brown (B_)\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 overrides both.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- Brown (B_) \u2192 brown\n- Red (Cc) \u2192 red\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 checkered\n\nBecause B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B is brown. Only if both are recessive (cc) does it become checkered, overriding any potential red.\n\nSimilarly, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C is red. Only if both are recessive (bb) does it become plain, overriding any potential brown.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown: B_\n- Red: Cc (but only if not B_, i.e., C_ and B_ combined?)\nWait, no. Because if a bird is B_, it's brown regardless of C. If it's C_ but not B_, it's red. If it's neither B_ nor C_, it's checkered. Similarly, if it's B_ but not C_, it's brown.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: The presence of B makes it brown, overriding the presence of C. The presence of C makes it red, overriding the presence of B. The absence of both makes it checkered.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown: B_ (regardless of C)\n- Red: C_ (regardless of B)\n- Checkered: cc\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether B is present, then C.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown: All birds with B_ (B_ can be BB, Bb, or Bb, but wait, in terms of dominance, B_ includes Bb and BB)\n- Red: All birds with C_ (Cc, Cc)\n- Checkered: All birds with cc (only the homozygous recessive)\n\nBut according to the hierarchy, if a bird has B_, it's brown, even if it's not C_. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Brown: B_ (any bird with at least one B)\n2. Red: C_ (any bird with at least one C)\n3. Checkered: cc\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16 (assuming 4x4 grid).\n\nNumber with B_: 13 (since only 3 have bb)\nNumber with C_: 13 (since only 3 have BB)\nNumber with cc: 1 (the last)\n\nBut according to the hierarchy:\n\nBrown: B_ \u2192 13 (all except bb)\nRed: C_ \u2192 13 (all except BB)\nCheckered: cc \u2192 1\n\nBut this leads to overlapping categories:\n\n- Brown includes red and checkered (wait no, because brown overrides red and checkered).\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up. According to the hierarchy, if a bird is brown, it's brown regardless of red or checkered. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown: B_ \u2192 13\n2. Red: C_ but not B_ \u2192 3 (Cc, Cc)\n3. Checkered: cc \u2192 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 13:3:1.\n\nBut the options don't include this ratio. The closest is option J, which lists a ratio of Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the hierarchy is such that brown is dominant over red, and red is dominant over checkered. But that contradicts the previous reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hierarchy is:\n\n- Brown (B) \u2192 dominant over red (C)\n- Red (C) \u2192 dominant over checkered (b)\n- Checkered (b) \u2192 dominant over brown (B)\n\nBut that would reverse the usual hierarchy, which seems unlikely. More likely, it's:\n\n- Brown (B) overrides red (C)\n- Red (C) overrides checkered (b)\n- Checkered (b) overrides brown (B)\n\nWhich would mean:\n\n- Brown: B_\n- Red: C_\n- Checkered: bb\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\nBrown: B_ (BB, Bb)\nRed: C_ (CC, Cb, cc)\nCheckered: bb\n\nAnd according to this, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nBrown: 9 (BB, Bb, bB, bb) \u2192 Wait, no, F2 is 16, so:\n\nBrown: 9 (since B_ can be BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, etc.)\nRed: 3 (Cc, C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes may not be expressed as phenotypes. So the phenotypes depend on whether the combination of C/c and B/b results in a particular trait. The traits are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the F2 generation without relying solely on the Punnett square. Instead, use the laws of Mendelian inheritance, considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since both genes are on separate chromosomes, their segregation is independent. Therefore, the F2 generation would have the following genotypic ratios:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pale red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor gene B:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nSince the two genes are on different chromosomes, their segregation is independent. Therefore, the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But let me confirm if that applies here.\n\nHowever, the actual phenotypes depend on how the alleles interact. For example, a bird could be CC BB (red-brown), CC Bb (red-brown), CC bb (red-checkered), Cc BB (pale-red-brown), etc. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait independently. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either C or B will express the corresponding phenotype. But the exact interaction might vary.\n\nAlternatively, considering that both genes are dominant, the phenotypes could be determined as follows:\n\n- If C is present (either C or cc), then regardless of B, it's red.\n- If B is present (either B or bb), then regardless of C, it's brown.\n- If neither C nor B is present (cc and bb), it's plain.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because each gene contributes to the overall color. Alternatively, perhaps the expression combines both traits. Maybe the bird's color depends on both genes. For instance, if the bird is CC BB, it's red-brown. If it's CC Bb, it's red-brown. CC bb is red-checkered, Cc BB is pale red-brown, Cc Bb is pale red-brown, and so on.\n\nThis is getting complex. Perhaps a better way is to determine the phenotypic ratio by considering all possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pale Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pale Red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pale Plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nNow, count the number of each type:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (CC Bb)\n- Checkered Plain: 1 (CC bb)\n- Pale Red: 2 (Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Pale Plain: 1 (Cc bb)\n- Plain Brown: 1 (cc BB)\n- Plain Red: 1 (cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 1 (cc Bb)\n- Plain Plain: 1 (cc bb)\n\nSo the counts are:\n\nCheckered Red: 1\nCheckered Brown: 2\nCheckered Plain: 1\nPale Red: 2\nPale Plain: 1\nPlain Brown: 1\nPlain Red: 1\nPlain Brown: 1\nPlain Plain: 1\n\nAdding them up: 1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1+1=10. Hmm, that adds up to 10, but the options don't include 10. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the individual birds are counted as F2, so each gamete is from a F1, which is CcBb. When F1 selfs, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB\n- From CB + cb: Cc Bb (twice, once for each order)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo there are three distinct genotypes: CC BB, Cc Bb (two copies), and cc bb.\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pale Red (since C is present)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain\n\nEach of these occurs in proportion based on the gametes. The probabilities are:\n\n- CC BB: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n- Cc Bb: 2*(1/2)*(1/2)=1/2\n- cc bb: (1/2)^2 = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes and their proportions are:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1/4 \u2192 25%\n- Pale Red: 1/2 \u2192 50%\n- Plain: 1/4 \u2192 25%\n\nNow, applying the phenotypes based on the rules:\n\n- Checkered Red: Always Checkered Red\n- Pale Red: Always Pale Red\n- Plain: Always Plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, with Checkered Red being the most frequent, followed by Pale Red, and Plain being the least frequent.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That doesn't match my current understanding. Option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which also doesn't fit. Option A is \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" \u2013 still not matching. Option J is \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 closer. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 no. Option F is \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2013 same as J. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the F2 proportions.\n\nWait, earlier I thought F2 genotypes were 1/4 each, leading to 25% Checkered Red, 50% Pale Red, 25% Plain. But looking back, I see that in the original F2 description, there are 4 genotypes: 1 Checkered Red, 2 Pale Red, 1 Plain, 1 Pale Red again, and 1 Plain. Wait, perhaps I overcounted. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the F2 set given:\n\nGametes: (CB) (cb)\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2 gametes: (CB)(cb)(cB)(cb)\n\nSo F2 would be:\n\n- CB + CB: CC BB\n- CB + cb: Cc Bb\n- cb + CB: Cc Bb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n\nSo four possible genotypes: 1 CC BB, 2 Cc Bb, 1 cc bb.\n\nTherefore, proportions:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: 2/4 \u2192 50% \u2192 Pale Red\n- cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1. Applying the dominance hierarchy, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered Red (always present)\n- Pale Red (present if C is present)\n- Plain (only if both alleles are recessive for both genes)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, with Checkered Red being the most common, followed by Pale Red, and Plain being the least.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match this. However, option J states \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of dominant B makes the bird brown, overriding the C. So:\n\nIf B is present, the bird is brown. Otherwise, it's red. Similarly, if C is present, it's red; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each trait:\n\n- Brown (B) overrides red (C)\n- Plain (c) overrides brown (B)\n- Checkered (b) overrides both\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Brown (if B is present)\n2. Checkered (if b and c)\n3. Plain (if c and b)\n\nGiven that, let's reevaluate the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red \u2192 Red, but since B is present, it's brown?\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe hierarchy is such that the presence of dominant B makes the bird brown, overriding the presence of dominant c. Similarly, the presence of dominant c makes it plain, overriding the presence of dominant B.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- If both B and c are present (i.e., B is dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If C is present (dominant), regardless of B, it's red.\n- If neither C nor B is present, it's plain.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be determined as:\n\n1. Brown (if B is dominant)\n2. Red (if C is dominant)\n3. Plain (if neither)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the frequency of each condition.\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n2. Cc BB \u2192 C is present \u2192 Red\n3. CC Bb \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n5. CC bb \u2192 B is absent (since b is recessive) \u2192 Plain\n6. Cc bb \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 C is absent \u2192 Plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 B is present \u2192 Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Neither \u2192 Plain\n\nCounting the instances where each phenotype occurs:\n\n- Brown: Cases 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 6 cases\n- Red: Case 2 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain: Cases 5,7 \u2192 2 cases\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Brown:Red:Plain = 6:1:2.\n\nBut the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, possibly including all phenotypes. However, the options provided do not include 6:1:2. Instead, the closest is option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio based on all possible combinations, not just dominance. But according to the hierarchy I've established, the ratio would be 6:1:2, but the options don't reflect that exactly. Looking at the options:\n\nOption J is \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2014 Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting dominance. Let me double-check.\n\nAnother approach: The dominance hierarchy could mean that if B is present, the bird is brown, overriding red. If C is present, red overrides brown. If neither is present, it's plain.\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n- If B is present (B_), it's brown.\n- Else, if C is present (C_), it's red.\n- Else, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as:\n\n1. Brown\n2. Red\n3. Plain\n\nThe frequencies of these phenotypes are based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain\n8. cc Bb \u2192 brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown occurs in cases 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 \u2192 7 cases\n- Red occurs in case 4 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain occurs in cases 3,7 \u2192 2 cases\n\nThus, the ratio is 7:1:2. Again, none of the options match this except option J, which suggests a different ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that if both B and b are present, the bird is brown, overriding the effect of C. So, the presence of B overrides C, making the bird brown unless C is present, in which case it's red unless B is present, in which case it's plain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me refer back to the initial F2 analysis. In the standard dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But under the dominance hierarchy, some categories combine. Given that B is dominant over b and C is dominant over c, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Brown (B_: always brown)\n- Red (C_: always red)\n- Checkered (bb and cc): but wait, in the hierarchy, checkered would be when neither B nor C is dominant, i.e., when both alleles are recessive. But in reality, the hierarchy goes from B to C to checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps the dominance hierarchy is such that:\n\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If neither B nor C is present (both recessive), the bird is checkered.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because checkered is usually recessive, while brown and red are dominant. Alternatively, perhaps the hierarchy is:\n\n- Brown (B_) \u2192 overrides red (C_)\n- Red (Cc) \u2192 overrides brown (B_)\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 overrides both.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\n- Brown (B_) \u2192 brown\n- Red (Cc) \u2192 red\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 checkered\n\nBecause B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B is brown. Only if both are recessive (cc) does it become checkered, overriding any potential red.\n\nSimilarly, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C is red. Only if both are recessive (bb) does it become plain, overriding any potential brown.\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Brown: B_\n- Red: Cc (but only if not B_, i.e., C_ and B_ combined?)\nWait, no. Because if a bird is B_, it's brown regardless of C. If it's C_ but not B_, it's red. If it's neither B_ nor C_, it's checkered. Similarly, if it's B_ but not C_, it's brown.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: The presence of B makes it brown, overriding the presence of C. The presence of C makes it red, overriding the presence of B. The absence of both makes it checkered.\n\nSo:\n\n- Brown: B_ (regardless of C)\n- Red: C_ (regardless of B)\n- Checkered: cc\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether B is present, then C.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown: All birds with B_ (B_ can be BB, Bb, or Bb, but wait, in terms of dominance, B_ includes Bb and BB)\n- Red: All birds with C_ (Cc, Cc)\n- Checkered: All birds with cc (only the homozygous recessive)\n\nBut according to the hierarchy, if a bird has B_, it's brown, even if it's not C_. So:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Brown: B_ (any bird with at least one B)\n2. Red: C_ (any bird with at least one C)\n3. Checkered: cc\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16 (assuming 4x4 grid).\n\nNumber with B_: 13 (since only 3 have bb)\nNumber with C_: 13 (since only 3 have BB)\nNumber with cc: 1 (the last)\n\nBut according to the hierarchy:\n\nBrown: B_ \u2192 13 (all except bb)\nRed: C_ \u2192 13 (all except BB)\nCheckered: cc \u2192 1\n\nBut this leads to overlapping categories:\n\n- Brown includes red and checkered (wait no, because brown overrides red and checkered).\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up. According to the hierarchy, if a bird is brown, it's brown regardless of red or checkered. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Brown: B_ \u2192 13\n2. Red: C_ but not B_ \u2192 3 (Cc, Cc)\n3. Checkered: cc \u2192 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 13:3:1.\n\nBut the options don't include this ratio. The closest is option J, which lists a ratio of Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the hierarchy is such that brown is dominant over red, and red is dominant over checkered. But that contradicts the previous reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hierarchy is:\n\n- Brown (B) \u2192 dominant over red (C)\n- Red (C) \u2192 dominant over checkered (b)\n- Checkered (b) \u2192 dominant over brown (B)\n\nBut that would reverse the usual hierarchy, which seems unlikely. More likely, it's:\n\n- Brown (B) overrides red (C)\n- Red (C) overrides checkered (b)\n- Checkered (b) overrides brown (B)\n\nWhich would mean:\n\n- Brown: B_\n- Red: C_\n- Checkered: bb\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\nBrown: B_ (BB, Bb)\nRed: C_ (CC, Cb, cc)\nCheckered: bb\n\nAnd according to this, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nBrown: 9 (BB, Bb, bB, bb) \u2192 Wait, no, F2 is 16, so:\n\nBrown: 9 (since B_ can be BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, etc.)\nRed: 3 (Cc, C",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes might combine into the same phenotype.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes might combine into the same phenotype. Wait, but the question specifies looking at the phenotypic ratio based on the phenotypes, not the actual genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on what's needed: the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their offspring are F1 (CcBb) and then F2. Wait, but if the F1 is CcBb, then F2 would be the results of F1 selfing, producing four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But when considering dominance, the actual phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- For pigment color (gene C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- For color (gene B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc BB \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 3, 7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2, 4, 5, 6 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 3, 7, 9 \u2192 Wait, case 3 is plain red, case 7 is plain brown, case 9 is plain red. So that's 2 plain red.\nWait, hold on. Case 3 is Cc BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red. Case 7 is cc BB \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain brown. Case 9 is cc bb \u2192 c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1 (CC BB), 3 (Cc BB), 7 (cc BB) \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2 (CC Bb), 4 (Cc Bb), 5 (Cc Bb?), Wait, wait, no. Cases 2, 4, 5, 6 are all Checkered Brown because they have at least one dominant B allele. Cases 2: CC Bb (B present), 4: Cc Bb (B present), 5: Cc Bb (B present), 6: Cc bb (B present). So that's 4 cases.\n\n- Plain red: Cases 3 (Cc BB), 9 (cc bb) \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: Cases 2 (CC Bb), 4 (Cc Bb), 5 (Cc Bb), 6 (Cc Bb) \u2192 4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 4 : 2 : 4\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our count of 3, 4, 2, 4. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which seems off. Option D is 1,3,9,3. Hmm, none seem to match exactly. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me recount. Cases:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,3,7 \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,4,5,6 \u2192 4\n- Plain red: Cases 3,6,9 \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n\nSo the ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 4 : 3 : 2\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check the F2 generation again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the F2 refers to the F1 selfed, which would include the F1's gametes. Wait, no, the F2 is the next generation after F1 selfing. So the F2 would have the following genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. As calculated earlier.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio based on dominance would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1), Cc BB (2), cc BB (3) \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb (4), Cc Bb (5), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (5) \u2192 Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (C_B_)\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (C_Bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (c_B_)\nPhenotype 4: Plain brown (c_Bb)\n\nLet's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n\n- Dominant C: 3/4 (since cc is 1/4)\nFor Color (B):\n\n- Dominant B: 3/4 (since bb is 1/4)\n\nSince both traits are independently assorting, the combined probabilities are:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nCheckered brown (C_Bb): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain red (c_B_): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain brown (c_Bb): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratio based on probabilities is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. This translates to 9/16 Checkered red, 3/16 Checkered brown, etc., totaling 16 parts.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation. If the F2 includes all possible genotypes and their phenotypes, then the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, there isn't a 9:3:3:1 option. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16?\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16?\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes! This matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All the same, which would mean all phenotypes equally represented, but that's not the case here.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but higher counts.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same.\nL. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nM. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but higher numbers.\nN. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, which states the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1, matching our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might combine into the same phenotype. Wait, but the question specifies looking at the phenotypic ratio based on the phenotypes, not the actual genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's focus on what's needed: the F2 phenotypic ratio based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their offspring are F1 (CcBb) and then F2. Wait, but if the F1 is CcBb, then F2 would be the results of F1 selfing, producing four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But when considering dominance, the actual phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- For pigment color (gene C):\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\n- For color (gene B):\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc BB \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 3, 7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2, 4, 5, 6 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 3, 7, 9 \u2192 Wait, case 3 is plain red, case 7 is plain brown, case 9 is plain red. So that's 2 plain red.\nWait, hold on. Case 3 is Cc BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red. Case 7 is cc BB \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain brown. Case 9 is cc bb \u2192 c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain red.\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1 (CC BB), 3 (Cc BB), 7 (cc BB) \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2 (CC Bb), 4 (Cc Bb), 5 (Cc Bb?), Wait, wait, no. Cases 2, 4, 5, 6 are all Checkered Brown because they have at least one dominant B allele. Cases 2: CC Bb (B present), 4: Cc Bb (B present), 5: Cc Bb (B present), 6: Cc bb (B present). So that's 4 cases.\n\n- Plain red: Cases 3 (Cc BB), 9 (cc bb) \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: Cases 2 (CC Bb), 4 (Cc Bb), 5 (Cc Bb), 6 (Cc Bb) \u2192 4\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 4 : 2 : 4\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our count of 3, 4, 2, 4. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which seems off. Option D is 1,3,9,3. Hmm, none seem to match exactly. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me recount. Cases:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,3,7 \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,4,5,6 \u2192 4\n- Plain red: Cases 3,6,9 \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2\n\nSo the ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 4 : 3 : 2\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check the F2 generation again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the F2 refers to the F1 selfed, which would include the F1's gametes. Wait, no, the F2 is the next generation after F1 selfing. So the F2 would have the following genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. As calculated earlier.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio based on dominance would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1), Cc BB (2), cc BB (3) \u2192 3\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb (4), Cc Bb (5), Cc BB (2), Cc Bb (5) \u2192 Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered red (C_B_)\nPhenotype 2: Checkered brown (C_Bb)\nPhenotype 3: Plain red (c_B_)\nPhenotype 4: Plain brown (c_Bb)\n\nLet's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor Pigment Color (C):\n\n- Dominant C: 3/4 (since cc is 1/4)\nFor Color (B):\n\n- Dominant B: 3/4 (since bb is 1/4)\n\nSince both traits are independently assorting, the combined probabilities are:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nCheckered brown (C_Bb): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain red (c_B_): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPlain brown (c_Bb): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratio based on probabilities is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. This translates to 9/16 Checkered red, 3/16 Checkered brown, etc., totaling 16 parts.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation. If the F2 includes all possible genotypes and their phenotypes, then the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, there isn't a 9:3:3:1 option. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16?\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16?\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes! This matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All the same, which would mean all phenotypes equally represented, but that's not the case here.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but higher counts.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same.\nL. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nM. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but higher numbers.\nN. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, which states the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1, matching our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " However, since the parents are both homozygous, the actual F2 genotypes depend on how the alleles assort. In this case, since both parents are homozygous, all F2 offspring will inherit either CC, Cc, cc, or bb. But considering dominance, the phenotypes will follow: - Dominant C and dominant B = red-brown (assuming red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered)\n- Dominant C and recessive B = red-checkered (since B is dominant, so if it's recessive, then the presence of B would make it brown, but wait, the way it's described is that B is dominant, so if B is present, it's brown, else checkered. Similarly, c is recessive for both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's focus on the F2 phenotype ratios. Since the parents are homozygous, the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be the result of selfing F1. Using Mendel's laws, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (all C)\n- 25% Cc (half C, half c)\n- 25% cc (all c)\n\nFor each of these, considering the genes separately:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - CC \u2192 dominant C (red)\n  - Cc \u2192 dominant C (red)\n  - cc \u2192 recessive c (plain)\n  \n- For gene B:\n  - CC \u2192 dominant B (brown)\n  - Cc \u2192 dominant B (brown)\n  - cc \u2192 recessive b (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles. Therefore:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: occurs when C is dominant and B is dominant. So CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. That's 5 cases.\n- Red-checkered: occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive. So CC bb, Cc bb. That's 2 cases.\n- Plain-brown: occurs when c is dominant and B is dominant. So cc BB, cc Bb. That's 2 cases.\n- Plain-checkered: occurs when c is dominant and B is recessive. So cc bb. That's 1 case.\n\nBut wait, the F2 population should be calculated based on the probabilities. Each F2 individual has a probability based on the F1 gametes. Since F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have the following probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nCounting the percentages:\n\n- Red-brown: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n- Red-checkered: 6.25% + 12.5% + 25% = 43.75%\n- Plain-brown: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n- Plain-checkered: 6.25%\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 ratios. Wait, another approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 cross. Since F1 is CcBb, F2 will be generated by crossing two F1 individuals. The possible F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (50%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown (phenotype A)\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown (B)\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered (C)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered (D)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered (D)\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered (D)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown (E)\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered (F)\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown (E)\n\nCounting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- A: 1 (CC BB)\n- B: 1 (CC Bb)\n- C: 1 (CC bb)\n- D: 3 (Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- E: 2 (cc BB, cc bb)\n- F: 1 (cc Bb)\n\nTotal: 1+1+1+3+2+1=9\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- A: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- B: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- C: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- D: 3/9 = 33.33%\n- E: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- F: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, close but not exact.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Closest is option J.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, the plain-brown phenotype is 2%, and checkered brown is 3%. Option J has plain red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, and plain brown 1. Hmm, that adds up to 12% (2+6+3+1=12). But in reality, plain-brown is 2%, checkered brown is 3%, red-brown is ~11.11%, and red-checkered is ~33.33%.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (CC BB, CC Bb)\n- Checkered brown: 6 (CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain red: 3 (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 1 (cc bb)\n\nAdding up to 12 out of 9, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 100%. Wait, I must have messed up somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 isn't correctly calculated. Another approach: each F1 is CcBb, so F2 will have a 25% chance for each combination. Let's list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nOut of these, how many fall into each category:\n\n- Red-brown: Cases 1 and 2 \u2192 2\n- Red-checkered: Cases 3,4,5,6 \u2192 4\n- Plain-brown: Cases 7 and 9 \u2192 2\n- Plain-checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- Red-brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Red-checkered: 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Plain-brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain-checkered: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our counts: 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But wait, 2+6+3+1=12, which is more than 100%. That's impossible. So perhaps the options are misrepresented, or I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 isn't what I thought. Maybe I should consider that the F1 is CcBb, so F2 would have different ratios. Wait, perhaps I confused F1 and F2 generations earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, where checkered red 12, etc., but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 to be CcBb and the F2 to be F1 x F1, leading to the correct counts. But according to my calculations, option J is the closest, even though it sums to 12 instead of 9. This suggests a possible error in the options or in the interpretation of the question.\n\nGiven the options, the most accurate choice based on my reasoning is option J, but there's a discrepancy in the sum. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but I'm not sure. Given the confusion, I'll go with option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, since the parents are both homozygous, the actual F2 genotypes depend on how the alleles assort. In this case, since both parents are homozygous, all F2 offspring will inherit either CC, Cc, cc, or bb. But considering dominance, the phenotypes will follow: - Dominant C and dominant B = red-brown (assuming red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered)\n- Dominant C and recessive B = red-checkered (since B is dominant, so if it's recessive, then the presence of B would make it brown, but wait, the way it's described is that B is dominant, so if B is present, it's brown, else checkered. Similarly, c is recessive for both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's focus on the F2 phenotype ratios. Since the parents are homozygous, the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will be the result of selfing F1. Using Mendel's laws, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (all C)\n- 25% Cc (half C, half c)\n- 25% cc (all c)\n\nFor each of these, considering the genes separately:\n\n- For gene C:\n  - CC \u2192 dominant C (red)\n  - Cc \u2192 dominant C (red)\n  - cc \u2192 recessive c (plain)\n  \n- For gene B:\n  - CC \u2192 dominant B (brown)\n  - Cc \u2192 dominant B (brown)\n  - cc \u2192 recessive b (checkered)\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles. Therefore:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: occurs when C is dominant and B is dominant. So CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. That's 5 cases.\n- Red-checkered: occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive. So CC bb, Cc bb. That's 2 cases.\n- Plain-brown: occurs when c is dominant and B is dominant. So cc BB, cc Bb. That's 2 cases.\n- Plain-checkered: occurs when c is dominant and B is recessive. So cc bb. That's 1 case.\n\nBut wait, the F2 population should be calculated based on the probabilities. Each F2 individual has a probability based on the F1 gametes. Since F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have the following probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, we multiply the probabilities:\n\n- CC BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: 50% * 50% = 25%\n- Cc bb: 50% * 25% = 12.5%\n- cc BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- cc bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nCounting the percentages:\n\n- Red-brown: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n- Red-checkered: 6.25% + 12.5% + 25% = 43.75%\n- Plain-brown: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n- Plain-checkered: 6.25%\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 ratios. Wait, another approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 cross. Since F1 is CcBb, F2 will be generated by crossing two F1 individuals. The possible F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (50%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 red-brown (phenotype A)\n- CC Bb \u2192 red-brown (B)\n- CC bb \u2192 red-checkered (C)\n- Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered (D)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered (D)\n- Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered (D)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain-brown (E)\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered (F)\n- cc bb \u2192 plain-brown (E)\n\nCounting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- A: 1 (CC BB)\n- B: 1 (CC Bb)\n- C: 1 (CC bb)\n- D: 3 (Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb)\n- E: 2 (cc BB, cc bb)\n- F: 1 (cc Bb)\n\nTotal: 1+1+1+3+2+1=9\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- A: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- B: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- C: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n- D: 3/9 = 33.33%\n- E: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- F: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with my calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, close but not exact.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. No.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Closest is option J.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, the plain-brown phenotype is 2%, and checkered brown is 3%. Option J has plain red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, and plain brown 1. Hmm, that adds up to 12% (2+6+3+1=12). But in reality, plain-brown is 2%, checkered brown is 3%, red-brown is ~11.11%, and red-checkered is ~33.33%.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (CC BB, CC Bb)\n- Checkered brown: 6 (CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain red: 3 (cc BB, cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 1 (cc bb)\n\nAdding up to 12 out of 9, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 100%. Wait, I must have messed up somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 isn't correctly calculated. Another approach: each F1 is CcBb, so F2 will have a 25% chance for each combination. Let's list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 red-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-checkered\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red-checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n\nOut of these, how many fall into each category:\n\n- Red-brown: Cases 1 and 2 \u2192 2\n- Red-checkered: Cases 3,4,5,6 \u2192 4\n- Plain-brown: Cases 7 and 9 \u2192 2\n- Plain-checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1\n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n- Red-brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Red-checkered: 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Plain-brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain-checkered: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our counts: 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But wait, 2+6+3+1=12, which is more than 100%. That's impossible. So perhaps the options are misrepresented, or I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 isn't what I thought. Maybe I should consider that the F1 is CcBb, so F2 would have different ratios. Wait, perhaps I confused F1 and F2 generations earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, where checkered red 12, etc., but that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 to be CcBb and the F2 to be F1 x F1, leading to the correct counts. But according to my calculations, option J is the closest, even though it sums to 12 instead of 9. This suggests a possible error in the options or in the interpretation of the question.\n\nGiven the options, the most accurate choice based on my reasoning is option J, but there's a discrepancy in the sum. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but I'm not sure. Given the confusion, I'll go with option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Let me look back at the options. Hmm, none of the options A through H list 25%. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe first parent is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), which makes sense because it's homozygous dominant for both traits. The second parent is plain brown (cc bb), homozygous recessive for both traits.\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as each gene segregates independently. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\nEach gene segregates into two gametes, so for C, gametes are C and c (25% each), and for B, gametes are B and b (25% each). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for gene C.\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for gene B.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are 1/4 CC BB, 1/4 CC bb, 1/4 cc BB, 1/4 cc bb.\n\nPhenotype-wise:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or equally likely for each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's not matching. Option D is 1, 3, 9, 3, which seems like a different distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the parents differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Let me re-read the problem. The first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the second is a plain brown bird (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would follow.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the phenotypes would be equally distributed. However, the options don't reflect that. Perhaps I missed something in the genotypes.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the dihybrid cross involves both traits, but the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio isn't 1:1:1:1 due to incomplete dominance or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the F2 generation without the assumption of independent assortment. But I think the standard approach assumes independent assortment unless stated otherwise.\n\nLet me consider the options again. If the F2 has four phenotypes, each with 25% probability, but some might combine. For example, if a bird is both checkered and red, it would still be classified as checkered red, regardless of whether it's also brown or plain. So the phenotypic ratio would be four categories, each with 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut none of the options match that exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 12.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Summing to 16.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16.\n\nHmm, none of them sum to 16 except option F. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recount.\n\nWait, 16 birds total. If each phenotype is equally likely, 4 categories each with 4 birds (25% each). So each phenotype would have 4 birds. So F option shows each phenotype with 4 birds, which adds up to 16.\n\nYes, that matches. So the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, since both genes are independently assorting, each combination occurs. But in reality, since each parent contributes either CB or cb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC (from CB+CB), Cc (from CB+cb), cc (from cb+cb), and bb (from cb+cb). But wait, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb):\n- 25% CB gamete \u2192 parent 1: CcBb \u2192 Cc (from CB) and Bb (from CB)\nWait, no. Actually, the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb in equal amounts. So when F1 selfs, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB+CB): dominant C and dominant B\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb): dominant C and heterozygous B\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb): recessive c and recessive b\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb): recessive c and dominant B\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the F1 is CcBb, which is a double heterozygote. So when selfed, the F2 will have four genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for B: Bb: 50%, bb: 25%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, looking at the phenotype:\n\nFor each genotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- CC bb \u2192 checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n- cc BB \u2192 plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be 25% checkered red, 25% checkered brown, 25% plain red, 25% plain brown.\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include 25% each. Let me look back at the options. Hmm, none of the options A through H list 25%. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe first parent is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), which makes sense because it's homozygous dominant for both traits. The second parent is plain brown (cc bb), homozygous recessive for both traits.\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, as each gene segregates independently. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\nEach gene segregates into two gametes, so for C, gametes are C and c (25% each), and for B, gametes are B and b (25% each). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for gene C.\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for gene B.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are 1/4 CC BB, 1/4 CC bb, 1/4 cc BB, 1/4 cc bb.\n\nPhenotype-wise:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or equally likely for each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's not matching. Option D is 1, 3, 9, 3, which seems like a different distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the parents differently.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Let me re-read the problem. The first parent is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the second is a plain brown bird (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would follow.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the phenotypes would be equally distributed. However, the options don't reflect that. Perhaps I missed something in the genotypes.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the dihybrid cross involves both traits, but the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio isn't 1:1:1:1 due to incomplete dominance or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the F2 generation without the assumption of independent assortment. But I think the standard approach assumes independent assortment unless stated otherwise.\n\nLet me consider the options again. If the F2 has four phenotypes, each with 25% probability, but some might combine. For example, if a bird is both checkered and red, it would still be classified as checkered red, regardless of whether it's also brown or plain. So the phenotypic ratio would be four categories, each with 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut none of the options match that exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Summing to 12.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Summing to 16.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16.\n\nHmm, none of them sum to 16 except option F. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recount.\n\nWait, 16 birds total. If each phenotype is equally likely, 4 categories each with 4 birds (25% each). So each phenotype would have 4 birds. So F option shows each phenotype with 4 birds, which adds up to 16.\n\nYes, that matches. So the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned.

CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered checkered\n4. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, looking at the F2 generation, what are the probabilities?\n\nSince each parent contributes either CB or cb, the F2 genotypes are equally likely among the four possibilities. But considering dominance, some genotypes may produce the same phenotype.\n\nHowever, when calculating the phenotypic ratio, we consider the number of each phenotype regardless of the underlying genotype. Let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 1/4 of the time (25%)\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb \u2192 another 1/4 (25%)\n- Checkered checkered: cc bb \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n- Plain brown: cc Bb \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n- Plain checkered: CC bb \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n\nWait, but that sums up to 6 categories, but in reality, some genotypes produce the same phenotype. Specifically:\n\n- CC BB and cc bb both result in Checkered.\n- CC Bb results in Checkered brown.\n- cc BB and cc bb both result in Plain red.\n- CC bb and cc Bb both result in Plain checkered.\n- CC Bb and cc Bb both result in Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (from CC BB) + 1 (from cc bb) = 2\n- Checkered brown: 1 (from CC Bb)\n- Plain red: 1 (from cc BB) + 1 (from cc bb) = 2\n- Plain brown: 1 (from CC Bb) + 1 (from cc Bb) = 2\n- Plain checkered: 1 (from CC bb) + 1 (from cc bb) = 2\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because there are six phenotypes, but in reality, each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach F2 individual can be classified into one of six phenotypic categories based on their combination of alleles for C and B.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): Checkered red\n2. C (dominant) and B (recessive): Checkered brown\n3. C (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain brown\n4. C (recessive) and B (recessive): Plain red\n\nEach of these combinations is distinct and non-overlapping, except for cases where they might produce similar phenotypes due to dominance. But according to the problem statement, each trait is controlled by separate genes, so the phenotypes are determined independently. Therefore, each of these combinations leads to a unique phenotype.\n\nThus, the F2 generation would have the following phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 1/4 of the time\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): 1/4 of the time\n- Plain brown (cc_B_): 1/4 of the time\n- Plain red (cc_bb): 1/4 of the time\n- Checkered brown (CC_Bb): 1/4 of the time\n- Plain brown (CC_bB): 1/4 of the time\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\nActually, each F2 individual is a combination of the two genes. The possible phenotypic outcomes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C_B_), the phenotype is Checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is absent (C_bb), phenotype is Checkered brown.\n- If B is present but C is absent (cc_B_), phenotype is Plain brown.\n- If neither is present (cc_bb), phenotype is Plain red.\n\nAdditionally, if both C and B are absent (cc_bb), it's Plain red. Similarly, any presence of C or B would lead to different phenotypes.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of the dominant alleles leads to those phenotypes. So:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered red\n- C_bb: Checkered brown\n- cc_B_: Plain brown\n- cc_bb: Plain red\n\nEach of these four combinations represents a distinct phenotype. Therefore, the F2 generation would have four phenotypic categories, each occurring at a frequency of 25%. But the options given in the question don't seem to reflect this directly. Instead, the options are giving a total of six phenotypes, which suggests that I might have misapplied something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the actual number of each phenotype based on the number of genotypes, without grouping them into phenotypes. In that case, each phenotype occurs in certain numbers:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (from CC BB and cc bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (from CC Bb)\n- Plain red: 2 (from cc BB and cc bb)\n- Plain brown: 2 (from CC Bb and cc Bb)\n- Plain checkered: 2 (from CC bb and cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 10 individuals, which doesn't make sense. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's instead calculate the actual counts based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each parent (the F1) produces gametes in a 1:1 ratio of CB and cb. So, the F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2:\n\nPossible gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb (assuming random segregation).\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so each parent can produce four types of gametes, but since both parents are heterozygous for both genes, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, no\u2014the question specifies that it's an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), which would result in a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, no\u2014the initial description was a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but with specific phenotypes based on the dominance of each gene.\n\nLet me outline the possible F2 phenotypes and their frequencies:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_):\n   This occurs when both C and B are present. The probability is (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9.\n\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb):\n   This occurs when C is present but B is absent. Probability is (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9.\n\n3. Plain brown (cc_B_):\n   This occurs when B is present but C is absent. Probability is (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9.\n\n4. Plain red (cc_bb):\n   This occurs when neither C nor B is present. Probability is (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Adding them up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to actual counts, assuming a large population:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 parts\n- Checkered brown: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 2 parts\n- Plain red: 1 part\n\nIf the total is 9 parts, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 \u2248 44.4%\n- Checkered brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n- Plain brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n- Plain red: 1/9 \u2248 11.1%\n\nBut the answer choices given are numerical ratios, so perhaps I need to express them in whole numbers.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems off because it sums to 16, which isn't possible. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which also seems inconsistent. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16, which is impossible. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16 as well. Hmm, none of these add up to 16, which is the sum of all phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the F2 phenotypic ratios.\n\nUsing the 9:3:3:1 ratio for dihybrid crosses:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 4 parts\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): 2 parts\n- Plain brown (cc_B_): 2 parts\n- Plain red (cc_bb): 1 part\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 parts.\n\nAssuming 9 animals, how many would fall into each category:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain red: 1\n\nBut the answer options don't provide such exact numbers. They use \"checkered red 6\", etc., implying approximate counts. Looking back at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which is too high.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16, which is also too high.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total: 16.\n\nHmm, none of these exactly match my calculation. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The answer options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nWait, none of these options add up to 16. The total number of F2 individuals is 16 (since 2^4 = 16 for a dihybrid cross). So perhaps the options are presented as counts per phenotype rather than percentages.\n\nGiven that, let's see:\n\nCheckered red: 4\nCheckered brown: 2\nPlain brown: 2\nPlain red: 1\n\nAdding up to 9, which is less than 16. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the options are simplified or rounded.\n\nLooking at option C: 9, 3, 3, 1. That adds up to 16. So, perhaps the actual counts are:\n\nCheckered red: 9\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain brown: 3\nPlain red: 1\n\nWhich matches option C. So, even though my calculation gave 4, 2, 2, 1, the closest matching option is C: 9, 3, 3, 1.\n\nBut wait, why? Let me verify the calculations once more. The dihybrid cross for two genes with dominant alleles will yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Applying dominance, we get:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 4/9\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): 2/9\n- Plain brown (cc_B_): 2/9\n- Plain red (cc_bb): 1/9\n\nMultiplying by 16 (total number of F2 individuals):\n\n- Checkered red: 4 * (16/9) \u2248 7.11 (but since we can't have fractions, it rounds to 7 or 8)\n- Checkered brown: 2 * (16/9) \u2248 3.55 \u2192 4\n- Plain brown: 2 * (16/9) \u2248 3.55 \u2192 4\n- Plain red: 1 * (16/9) \u2248 1.78 \u2192 2\n\nBut rounding could vary. Alternatively, considering the actual counts, the F2 dihybrid cross would have 16 animals, and the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 4:2:2:1. However, none of the options perfectly match this. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16, suggesting that the actual counts are higher. But that contradicts our expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of phenotypes, not the absolute counts. So, considering the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Checkered brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain red: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nIf we take the denominator as 16 (total individuals), then:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 * 16 \u2248 7.11 \u2192 approx 7\n- Checkered brown: 2/9 * 16 \u2248 3.55 \u2192 approx 4\n- Plain brown: 2/9 * 16 \u2248 3.55 \u2192 approx 4\n- Plain red: 1/9 * 16 \u2248 1.78 \u2192 approx 2\n\nBut the options don't include these rounded numbers. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16, but that would mean 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain red. However, according to our calculation, the actual numbers should be around 7, 4, 4, 2. None of the options match exactly. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio before the dihybrid cross, but that doesn't align with the question wording. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which would correspond to option C.\n\nTherefore, despite the confusion, I think the correct answer is option C, as it reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is typical for a dihybrid cross with independent traits.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, in reality, each parent's gametes are either CB or cb, so the possible combinations are:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself (F1 \u00d7 F1), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each with 50% probability. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC (25%)\n- From CB + cb: Cc (25%)\n- From cb + CB: Cc (another 25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc (25%)\n\nWait, but no\u2014that's not quite right. Because each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the possible combinations are:\n\nParent A (F1): CB or cb\nParent B (F1): CB or cb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc (25%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc (another 25%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc (25%)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes, we need to look at the alleles for both genes.\n\nGene C affects pigment color:\n- C \u2192 red\n- c \u2192 plain\n\nGene B affects color:\n- B \u2192 brown\n- b \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both C and B.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered checkered\n4. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n5. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n6. cc bb \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, looking at the F2 generation, what are the probabilities?\n\nSince each parent contributes either CB or cb, the F2 genotypes are equally likely among the four possibilities. But considering dominance, some genotypes may produce the same phenotype.\n\nHowever, when calculating the phenotypic ratio, we consider the number of each phenotype regardless of the underlying genotype. Let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 1/4 of the time (25%)\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb \u2192 another 1/4 (25%)\n- Checkered checkered: cc bb \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n- Plain brown: cc Bb \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n- Plain checkered: CC bb \u2192 1/4 (25%)\n\nWait, but that sums up to 6 categories, but in reality, some genotypes produce the same phenotype. Specifically:\n\n- CC BB and cc bb both result in Checkered.\n- CC Bb results in Checkered brown.\n- cc BB and cc bb both result in Plain red.\n- CC bb and cc Bb both result in Plain checkered.\n- CC Bb and cc Bb both result in Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (from CC BB) + 1 (from cc bb) = 2\n- Checkered brown: 1 (from CC Bb)\n- Plain red: 1 (from cc BB) + 1 (from cc bb) = 2\n- Plain brown: 1 (from CC Bb) + 1 (from cc Bb) = 2\n- Plain checkered: 1 (from CC bb) + 1 (from cc bb) = 2\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because there are six phenotypes, but in reality, each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach F2 individual can be classified into one of six phenotypic categories based on their combination of alleles for C and B.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): Checkered red\n2. C (dominant) and B (recessive): Checkered brown\n3. C (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain brown\n4. C (recessive) and B (recessive): Plain red\n\nEach of these combinations is distinct and non-overlapping, except for cases where they might produce similar phenotypes due to dominance. But according to the problem statement, each trait is controlled by separate genes, so the phenotypes are determined independently. Therefore, each of these combinations leads to a unique phenotype.\n\nThus, the F2 generation would have the following phenotypic distribution:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 1/4 of the time\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): 1/4 of the time\n- Plain brown (cc_B_): 1/4 of the time\n- Plain red (cc_bb): 1/4 of the time\n- Checkered brown (CC_Bb): 1/4 of the time\n- Plain brown (CC_bB): 1/4 of the time\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me clarify:\n\nActually, each F2 individual is a combination of the two genes. The possible phenotypic outcomes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So:\n\n- If both C and B are present (C_B_), the phenotype is Checkered red.\n- If C is present but B is absent (C_bb), phenotype is Checkered brown.\n- If B is present but C is absent (cc_B_), phenotype is Plain brown.\n- If neither is present (cc_bb), phenotype is Plain red.\n\nAdditionally, if both C and B are absent (cc_bb), it's Plain red. Similarly, any presence of C or B would lead to different phenotypes.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of the dominant alleles leads to those phenotypes. So:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered red\n- C_bb: Checkered brown\n- cc_B_: Plain brown\n- cc_bb: Plain red\n\nEach of these four combinations represents a distinct phenotype. Therefore, the F2 generation would have four phenotypic categories, each occurring at a frequency of 25%. But the options given in the question don't seem to reflect this directly. Instead, the options are giving a total of six phenotypes, which suggests that I might have misapplied something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the actual number of each phenotype based on the number of genotypes, without grouping them into phenotypes. In that case, each phenotype occurs in certain numbers:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (from CC BB and cc bb)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (from CC Bb)\n- Plain red: 2 (from cc BB and cc bb)\n- Plain brown: 2 (from CC Bb and cc Bb)\n- Plain checkered: 2 (from CC bb and cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 10 individuals, which doesn't make sense. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's instead calculate the actual counts based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each parent (the F1) produces gametes in a 1:1 ratio of CB and cb. So, the F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2:\n\nPossible gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb (assuming random segregation).\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so each parent can produce four types of gametes, but since both parents are heterozygous for both genes, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, no\u2014the question specifies that it's an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), which would result in a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, no\u2014the initial description was a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 selfing.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but with specific phenotypes based on the dominance of each gene.\n\nLet me outline the possible F2 phenotypes and their frequencies:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_):\n   This occurs when both C and B are present. The probability is (2/3)*(2/3) = 4/9.\n\n2. Checkered brown (C_bb):\n   This occurs when C is present but B is absent. Probability is (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9.\n\n3. Plain brown (cc_B_):\n   This occurs when B is present but C is absent. Probability is (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9.\n\n4. Plain red (cc_bb):\n   This occurs when neither C nor B is present. Probability is (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Adding them up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to actual counts, assuming a large population:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 parts\n- Checkered brown: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 2 parts\n- Plain red: 1 part\n\nIf the total is 9 parts, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 \u2248 44.4%\n- Checkered brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n- Plain brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.2%\n- Plain red: 1/9 \u2248 11.1%\n\nBut the answer choices given are numerical ratios, so perhaps I need to express them in whole numbers.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems off because it sums to 16, which isn't possible. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which also seems inconsistent. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That totals 16, which is impossible. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16 as well. Hmm, none of these add up to 16, which is the sum of all phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the F2 phenotypic ratios.\n\nUsing the 9:3:3:1 ratio for dihybrid crosses:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 4 parts\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): 2 parts\n- Plain brown (cc_B_): 2 parts\n- Plain red (cc_bb): 1 part\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 parts.\n\nAssuming 9 animals, how many would fall into each category:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain brown: 2\n- Plain red: 1\n\nBut the answer options don't provide such exact numbers. They use \"checkered red 6\", etc., implying approximate counts. Looking back at option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which is too high.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16, which is also too high.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Total: 16.\n\nHmm, none of these exactly match my calculation. Maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The answer options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nWait, none of these options add up to 16. The total number of F2 individuals is 16 (since 2^4 = 16 for a dihybrid cross). So perhaps the options are presented as counts per phenotype rather than percentages.\n\nGiven that, let's see:\n\nCheckered red: 4\nCheckered brown: 2\nPlain brown: 2\nPlain red: 1\n\nAdding up to 9, which is less than 16. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the options are simplified or rounded.\n\nLooking at option C: 9, 3, 3, 1. That adds up to 16. So, perhaps the actual counts are:\n\nCheckered red: 9\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain brown: 3\nPlain red: 1\n\nWhich matches option C. So, even though my calculation gave 4, 2, 2, 1, the closest matching option is C: 9, 3, 3, 1.\n\nBut wait, why? Let me verify the calculations once more. The dihybrid cross for two genes with dominant alleles will yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Applying dominance, we get:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 4/9\n- Checkered brown (C_bb): 2/9\n- Plain brown (cc_B_): 2/9\n- Plain red (cc_bb): 1/9\n\nMultiplying by 16 (total number of F2 individuals):\n\n- Checkered red: 4 * (16/9) \u2248 7.11 (but since we can't have fractions, it rounds to 7 or 8)\n- Checkered brown: 2 * (16/9) \u2248 3.55 \u2192 4\n- Plain brown: 2 * (16/9) \u2248 3.55 \u2192 4\n- Plain red: 1 * (16/9) \u2248 1.78 \u2192 2\n\nBut rounding could vary. Alternatively, considering the actual counts, the F2 dihybrid cross would have 16 animals, and the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 4:2:2:1. However, none of the options perfectly match this. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16, suggesting that the actual counts are higher. But that contradicts our expectation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of phenotypes, not the absolute counts. So, considering the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Checkered brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain brown: 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain red: 1/9 \u2248 11.11%\n\nIf we take the denominator as 16 (total individuals), then:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9 * 16 \u2248 7.11 \u2192 approx 7\n- Checkered brown: 2/9 * 16 \u2248 3.55 \u2192 approx 4\n- Plain brown: 2/9 * 16 \u2248 3.55 \u2192 approx 4\n- Plain red: 1/9 * 16 \u2248 1.78 \u2192 approx 2\n\nBut the options don't include these rounded numbers. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16, but that would mean 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain red. However, according to our calculation, the actual numbers should be around 7, 4, 4, 2. None of the options match exactly. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio before the dihybrid cross, but that doesn't align with the question wording. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross, leading to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which would correspond to option C.\n\nTherefore, despite the confusion, I think the correct answer is option C, as it reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is typical for a dihybrid cross with independent traits.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, the actual F1 may have different genotypes if there's any linkage or dominance issues, but the question doesn't mention any linkage, so we'll assume independent assortment.",
    "rollout": " However, the actual F1 may have different genotypes if there's any linkage or dominance issues, but the question doesn't mention any linkage, so we'll assume independent assortment.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the parents are CC BB (F1) and cc bb (F1). So F2 would be the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, which would indeed lead to the four genotypes above. Now, what about the phenotypes? Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc_: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb_: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Red) x BB (Brown): Phenotype = Red Brown\n2. CC (Red) x Bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Red Checkered\n3. Cc (Red) x BB (Brown): Phenotype = Red Brown\n4. Cc (Red) x Bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Red Checkered\n5. cc (Plain) x BB (Brown): Phenotype = Plain Brown\n6. cc (Plain) x Bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Plain Checkered\n7. cc (Plain) x BB (Brown): Phenotype = Plain Brown\n8. cc (Plain) x Bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1, 3 \u2192 2 cases\n- Red Checkered: Cases 2, 4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Brown: Cases 5, 7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Checkered: Cases 6, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n\nBut wait, the options given don't seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options:\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off because according to my calculation, each phenotype occurs twice. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the dihybrid cross without considering independent assortment, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the question counts each occurrence based on the number of possible gametes. Wait, another approach: in a dihybrid cross where both parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, since some phenotypes might overlap or be confused, like 'plain red' being the same as 'plain checkered,' but I think each combination is unique.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. For example, a bird with genotype cc bb will be plain checkered because both are recessive. Similarly, CC BB is red and brown. CC bb is red and plain. cc BB is plain and brown. And cc bb is plain and plain. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (from CC BB)\n2. Red Plain (from CC bb)\n3. Plain Brown (from cc BB)\n4. Plain Plain (from cc bb)\n\nIn the F2 generation, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nGiven that each F2 bird is produced by F1 \u00d7 F1, and each F1 is CcBb, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for each of these, combined with B and b:\n\n- For CC (Red):\n  - BB (Brown): Phenotype Red Brown\n  - Bb (Checkered): Phenotype Red Checkered\n\n- For Cc (Red):\n  - BB (Brown): Phenotype Red Brown\n  - Bb (Checkered): Phenotype Red Checkered\n\n- For cc (Plain):\n  - BB (Brown): Phenotype Plain Brown\n  - Bb (Checkered): Phenotype Plain Checkered\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Red Checkered: 25% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that's not matching. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not quite. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigmentation (C): C_ (C dominant) \u2192 Red; cc \u2192 Plain.\n- Color (B): B_ (B dominant) \u2192 Brown; bb \u2192 Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (c_bb)\n\nFrom the F2, each of these would occur as follows:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% of the time\n- Red Checkered: 25% of the time\n- Plain Brown: 25% of the time\n- Plain Checkered: 25% of the time\n\nSo, the total population would have equal numbers for each phenotype. If the total F2 is 100%, then each phenotype is 25%. But looking at the options, they seem to suggest larger numbers. Perhaps the options are scaled differently, maybe considering the number of possible gametes or considering that some phenotypes combine into others due to blending.\n\nWait, perhaps the options consider the sum of certain phenotypes. For instance, \"checkered red\" might refer to individuals who are both checkered and red, but in reality, each bird is either red or plain, and brown or checkered. So perhaps the term \"checkered\" refers only to the pigmentation part, and \"red\" refers to the color part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute the actual numbers. In F2, each bird has four possible phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. However, if we count the number of birds per phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 = 100 birds (for simplicity).\n\nPhenotype 1: Red Brown \u2192 25 birds\nPhenotype 2: Red Checkered \u2192 25 birds\nPhenotype 3: Plain Brown \u2192 25 birds\nPhenotype 4: Plain Checkered \u2192 25 birds\n\nThis totals 100 birds. None of the answer choices match this exact distribution. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, adding up to 16, which is less than 100. Maybe the options are considering some scaling factor or perhaps a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't about a dihybrid cross but a monohybrid cross. Let me read the question again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So it's a dihybrid scenario. Then, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Wait, no\u2014that's a monohybrid cross. Oh! Wait, hold on, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, the initial description says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So that's a single trait for color. Then, the second point says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So that's another trait. Thus, the question involves two traits, making it a dihybrid cross. So the cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb), producing F1, then F2.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the result of that cross. But the user initially wrote that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the cross is a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the first parent is CC BB (homozygous), and the second is cc bb (homozygous recessive). So the F1 would be CcBb, as each allele combines. Then, F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. So the F2 would include all possible combinations of C and B alleles, leading to the four phenotypes I discussed earlier.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to fit except option E, which is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding those up gives 16, which is still less than 100. Maybe the options are scaled differently, perhaps considering the number of possible gametes or the actual numbers in the F2 generation based on Mendelian inheritance.\n\nWait, let me calculate the actual numbers in F2. The F1 is CcBb. Each gene locus segregates independently, so for each gene, the probability is 25% for each allele.\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- C_: 50% (since Cc \u2192 50% chance)\n- cc: 50% (since cc is homozygous recessive)\n\nFor Color (B):\n- B_: 50% (since Bb \u2192 50% chance)\n- bb: 50% (since bb is homozygous recessive)\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the overall probabilities are multiplied. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_ (Red Brown): 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Phenotype 2: C_b_ (Red Checkered): 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Phenotype 3: c_B_ (Plain Brown): 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Phenotype 4: c_bb (Plain Checkered): 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nIf we take 100 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 25\n- Red Checkered: 25\n- Plain Brown: 25\n- Plain Checkered: 25\n\nBut the options don't match this. Let me see if any of them approximate this. Option G has 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., totaling 20, which is also not matching. Option H has 5, 3, 2, 6, totalling 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2\u219216. Option B: 8,4,0,4\u219216. Option C:12,2,2,2\u219218. Option D:1,3,9,3\u219216. Option E:3,9,1,3\u219216. Option F:4,4,4,4\u219216. Option I:7,5,1,3\u219216. Option J:2,6,3,1\u219212. Option K: etc.\n\nWait, all options add up to 16 or 12 or 18. Unless I'm missing something else. Perhaps the options are considering only certain phenotypes. For example, \"checkered red\" might refer to the combination of both traits being present, i.e., having both checkered and red pigment. But in reality, each bird is either red or plain, and either brown or checkered. So perhaps \"checkered red\" is a typo, and it should mean \"plain checkered,\" which would be phenotype 4. But even then, the options don't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation's ratio of checkered red to plain red, ignoring the other colors. Wait, the question specifically asks for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. Looking at option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Totaling 12, which doesn't make sense because F2 should be 100.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are based on the number of birds expressed in the F2 under certain conditions, such as survival or viability. But the question doesn't mention any exceptions, so all birds should survive.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the number of viable offspring considering incomplete dominance or other factors, but that's not indicated in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let me recount:\n\nEach F1 is CcBb. The F2 generation results from F1 \u00d7 F1, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red, plain)\n- 50% Cc (red, brown)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc (plain, plain)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each gene segregates independently. So for each gene:\n\n- C: 50% C_, 50% cc\n- B: 50% B_, 50% bb\n\nThus, combining them, the F2 would have the following phenotypes:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Red Brown (25%)\n2. C_bb \u2192 Red Checkered (25%)\n3. cc B_ \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (25%)\n\nSo, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, resulting in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options reflect this exact distribution. The closest option with equal parts is option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Which adds up to 16. But the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, so 25% each.\n\nWait, unless the options are presenting the F2 generation in terms of the number of birds per phenotype rather than percentages, assuming each bird has an equal chance. For example, if there are 100 birds, each phenotype would have 25 birds. But the options don't have that. They have smaller numbers. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which is less than 100. Option F sums to 16. Option E sums to 16 as well. Option G sums to 18. None matches 100. This suggests that either the options are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only one aspect of the phenotypes, such as whether the bird is red or plain, regardless of the color itself. But that wouldn't make much sense because red and plain are distinct categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are considering only the presence of the checkered trait along with the pigment color. For example, \"checkered red\" could mean the bird is both checkered and red, while \"plain red\" would be plain but red. But that interpretation complicates things further.\n\nWait, going back to the question: the options are presented as ratios, and I need to choose the one that correctly reflects the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. Given that, and knowing that the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different assumption, such as considering only certain phenotypes as separate entities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. But assuming the options are correct, perhaps the right choice is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16, but that's too small. Another thought: maybe the options are listing the number of birds with specific traits relative to others, perhaps focusing on the number of possible combinations rather than absolute counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with certain traits, considering the dominance hierarchy. Let me try recalculating based on dominance:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nColor (B):\n\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSo, the F2 generation would have:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. cc B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nEach of these occurs 25% of the time. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are considering the number of birds with each phenotype divided by the total, but the user wants the ratio expressed as numbers instead of percentages. So, if there are, say, 16 birds in F2, the ratios would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not reflected in any options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are giving the number of birds with certain combinations.\n\nWait, looking at option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which is inconsistent. Option E: 3+9=12, plus 1+3=4, total 16. Again, not 100.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose based on the reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 generation to have only two phenotypes: checkered and plain, ignoring color, but that contradicts the given traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the options, but given the analysis, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't present. Among the options, option E sums to 16, which is half of 32, suggesting that maybe the options are showing the proportion within a subset of the F2 generation, possibly considering only dominant traits or something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of the checkered trait, which would be two phenotypes: checkered and plain. But that's not what the question states.\n\nWait, perhaps",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the actual F1 may have different genotypes if there's any linkage or dominance issues, but the question doesn't mention any linkage, so we'll assume independent assortment.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the parents are CC BB (F1) and cc bb (F1). So F2 would be the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, which would indeed lead to the four genotypes above. Now, what about the phenotypes? Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc_: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb_: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSo each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Red) x BB (Brown): Phenotype = Red Brown\n2. CC (Red) x Bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Red Checkered\n3. Cc (Red) x BB (Brown): Phenotype = Red Brown\n4. Cc (Red) x Bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Red Checkered\n5. cc (Plain) x BB (Brown): Phenotype = Plain Brown\n6. cc (Plain) x Bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Plain Checkered\n7. cc (Plain) x BB (Brown): Phenotype = Plain Brown\n8. cc (Plain) x Bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Plain Checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1, 3 \u2192 2 cases\n- Red Checkered: Cases 2, 4 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Brown: Cases 5, 7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain Checkered: Cases 6, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n\nBut wait, the options given don't seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options:\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off because according to my calculation, each phenotype occurs twice. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the dihybrid cross without considering independent assortment, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the question counts each occurrence based on the number of possible gametes. Wait, another approach: in a dihybrid cross where both parents are homozygous for both traits, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, since some phenotypes might overlap or be confused, like 'plain red' being the same as 'plain checkered,' but I think each combination is unique.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. For example, a bird with genotype cc bb will be plain checkered because both are recessive. Similarly, CC BB is red and brown. CC bb is red and plain. cc BB is plain and brown. And cc bb is plain and plain. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (from CC BB)\n2. Red Plain (from CC bb)\n3. Plain Brown (from cc BB)\n4. Plain Plain (from cc bb)\n\nIn the F2 generation, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nGiven that each F2 bird is produced by F1 \u00d7 F1, and each F1 is CcBb, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nAnd for each of these, combined with B and b:\n\n- For CC (Red):\n  - BB (Brown): Phenotype Red Brown\n  - Bb (Checkered): Phenotype Red Checkered\n\n- For Cc (Red):\n  - BB (Brown): Phenotype Red Brown\n  - Bb (Checkered): Phenotype Red Checkered\n\n- For cc (Plain):\n  - BB (Brown): Phenotype Plain Brown\n  - Bb (Checkered): Phenotype Plain Checkered\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Red Checkered: 25% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25% \u00d7 50% = 25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, that's not matching. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not quite. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- Pigmentation (C): C_ (C dominant) \u2192 Red; cc \u2192 Plain.\n- Color (B): B_ (B dominant) \u2192 Brown; bb \u2192 Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (c_bb)\n\nFrom the F2, each of these would occur as follows:\n\n- Red Brown: 25% of the time\n- Red Checkered: 25% of the time\n- Plain Brown: 25% of the time\n- Plain Checkered: 25% of the time\n\nSo, the total population would have equal numbers for each phenotype. If the total F2 is 100%, then each phenotype is 25%. But looking at the options, they seem to suggest larger numbers. Perhaps the options are scaled differently, maybe considering the number of possible gametes or considering that some phenotypes combine into others due to blending.\n\nWait, perhaps the options consider the sum of certain phenotypes. For instance, \"checkered red\" might refer to individuals who are both checkered and red, but in reality, each bird is either red or plain, and brown or checkered. So perhaps the term \"checkered\" refers only to the pigmentation part, and \"red\" refers to the color part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute the actual numbers. In F2, each bird has four possible phenotypes, each occurring 25% of the time. However, if we count the number of birds per phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 = 100 birds (for simplicity).\n\nPhenotype 1: Red Brown \u2192 25 birds\nPhenotype 2: Red Checkered \u2192 25 birds\nPhenotype 3: Plain Brown \u2192 25 birds\nPhenotype 4: Plain Checkered \u2192 25 birds\n\nThis totals 100 birds. None of the answer choices match this exact distribution. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, adding up to 16, which is less than 100. Maybe the options are considering some scaling factor or perhaps a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem isn't about a dihybrid cross but a monohybrid cross. Let me read the question again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So it's a dihybrid scenario. Then, the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Wait, no\u2014that's a monohybrid cross. Oh! Wait, hold on, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, the initial description says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So that's a single trait for color. Then, the second point says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So that's another trait. Thus, the question involves two traits, making it a dihybrid cross. So the cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb), producing F1, then F2.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the result of that cross. But the user initially wrote that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the cross is a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the first parent is CC BB (homozygous), and the second is cc bb (homozygous recessive). So the F1 would be CcBb, as each allele combines. Then, F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. So the F2 would include all possible combinations of C and B alleles, leading to the four phenotypes I discussed earlier.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to fit except option E, which is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding those up gives 16, which is still less than 100. Maybe the options are scaled differently, perhaps considering the number of possible gametes or the actual numbers in the F2 generation based on Mendelian inheritance.\n\nWait, let me calculate the actual numbers in F2. The F1 is CcBb. Each gene locus segregates independently, so for each gene, the probability is 25% for each allele.\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- C_: 50% (since Cc \u2192 50% chance)\n- cc: 50% (since cc is homozygous recessive)\n\nFor Color (B):\n- B_: 50% (since Bb \u2192 50% chance)\n- bb: 50% (since bb is homozygous recessive)\n\nSince the two genes assort independently, the overall probabilities are multiplied. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_ (Red Brown): 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Phenotype 2: C_b_ (Red Checkered): 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Phenotype 3: c_B_ (Plain Brown): 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Phenotype 4: c_bb (Plain Checkered): 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nIf we take 100 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 25\n- Red Checkered: 25\n- Plain Brown: 25\n- Plain Checkered: 25\n\nBut the options don't match this. Let me see if any of them approximate this. Option G has 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., totaling 20, which is also not matching. Option H has 5, 3, 2, 6, totalling 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2\u219216. Option B: 8,4,0,4\u219216. Option C:12,2,2,2\u219218. Option D:1,3,9,3\u219216. Option E:3,9,1,3\u219216. Option F:4,4,4,4\u219216. Option I:7,5,1,3\u219216. Option J:2,6,3,1\u219212. Option K: etc.\n\nWait, all options add up to 16 or 12 or 18. Unless I'm missing something else. Perhaps the options are considering only certain phenotypes. For example, \"checkered red\" might refer to the combination of both traits being present, i.e., having both checkered and red pigment. But in reality, each bird is either red or plain, and either brown or checkered. So perhaps \"checkered red\" is a typo, and it should mean \"plain checkered,\" which would be phenotype 4. But even then, the options don't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation's ratio of checkered red to plain red, ignoring the other colors. Wait, the question specifically asks for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. Looking at option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Totaling 12, which doesn't make sense because F2 should be 100.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are based on the number of birds expressed in the F2 under certain conditions, such as survival or viability. But the question doesn't mention any exceptions, so all birds should survive.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the number of viable offspring considering incomplete dominance or other factors, but that's not indicated in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 phenotypic ratio. Let me recount:\n\nEach F1 is CcBb. The F2 generation results from F1 \u00d7 F1, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red, plain)\n- 50% Cc (red, brown)\n- 25% cc (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc (plain, plain)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each gene segregates independently. So for each gene:\n\n- C: 50% C_, 50% cc\n- B: 50% B_, 50% bb\n\nThus, combining them, the F2 would have the following phenotypes:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Red Brown (25%)\n2. C_bb \u2192 Red Checkered (25%)\n3. cc B_ \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (25%)\n\nSo, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, resulting in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options reflect this exact distribution. The closest option with equal parts is option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Which adds up to 16.

Another thought: maybe the options are listing the number of birds with specific traits relative to others, perhaps focusing on the number of possible combinations rather than absolute counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with certain traits, considering the dominance hierarchy. Let me try recalculating based on dominance:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nColor (B):\n\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSo, the F2 generation would have:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. cc B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nEach of these occurs 25% of the time. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are considering the number of birds with each phenotype divided by the total, but the user wants the ratio expressed as numbers instead of percentages. So, if there are, say, 16 birds in F2, the ratios would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not reflected in any options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are giving the number of birds with certain combinations.\n\nWait, looking at option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which is inconsistent. Option E: 3+9=12, plus 1+3=4, total 16. Again, not 100.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I must choose based on the reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 generation to have only two phenotypes: checkered and plain, ignoring color, but that contradicts the given traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the options, but given the analysis, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't present. Among the options, option E sums to 16, which is half of 32, suggesting that maybe the options are showing the proportion within a subset of the F2 generation, possibly considering only dominant traits or something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the presence of the checkered trait, which would be two phenotypes: checkered and plain. But that's not what the question states.\n\nWait, perhaps",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, the actual segregation might differ if there are any lethal traits or if the parents are producing different gametes. In our case, let's proceed under standard Mendelian assumptions.\n\nNow, considering the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. Let's consider each gene separately first, then combine them.\n\nGene C: \n- C (red) \n- c (plain)\n\nGene B: \n- B (brown) \n- b (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, we can analyze each independently and then combine the results.\n\nFirst, let's look at the phenotype ratios for each gene without considering the other.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- If both alleles are C (CC or Cc), the bird is red.\n- If both are c (cc), it's plain.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n- If both are B (BB or Bb), the bird is brown.\n- If both are b (bb), it's checkered.\n\nBut since the question is about a dihybrid cross, we'll need to consider the combination of these two traits.\n\nWait, but the question specifies a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing F1.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1. F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nSo the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red, checkered)\n- 25% CcBb (red, brown)\n- 25% CcBb (red, brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because in a typical dihybrid cross, we'd expect certain ratios for each trait. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross between the two parents, i.e., F1 \u00d7 F1. But the options given include various ratios, so let's see what each option says.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the F2 generation.\n\nF1 is CcBb. Each gamete is either CB or cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo F2 would have:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB \u2192 red, checkered\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb \u2192 red, brown\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: same as above\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red, checkered)\n- 50% CcBb (red, brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- For each bird, if it's CC (red) and BB (checkered): red, checkered\n- CC (red) and Bb (brown): red, brown\n- cc (plain) and BB (checkered): plain, checkered\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown): plain, brown\n\nSo the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Red, checkered (CC BB)\n2. Red, brown (CC Bb)\n3. Plain, checkered (cc BB)\n4. Plain, brown (cc Bb)\n\nNow, the ratios would depend on how many of each genotype exist in the F2.\n\nFrom the Punnett square, each genotype occurs as follows:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB \u2192 red, checkered\n- 2/4 CcBb \u2192 red, brown\n- 1/4 cc bb \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014because each F2 bird has two alleles for each gene, so the probabilities are additive. For example, for Gene C:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50% (since Cc is half of the remaining)\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of a bird being red (for Gene C) and brown (for Gene B) is 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%, etc.\n\nSo let's compute the phenotypic ratios:\n\n1. Red, checkered: This occurs when the bird is CC (red) and bb (checkered). The probability is 25% for CC and 25% for bb, so 25% * 25% = 6.25% or 1/16.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Wait, the presence of two dominant alleles is independent. So the probability of being red (at least one dominant C) is 75%, but in terms of checking whether it's red, the only way to get red is if the bird is CC or Cc. Similarly, being checkered depends on the B gene.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of birds in each phenotype category.\n\nAssuming a large population, say 16 birds (to make calculations easy):\n\n- Number of red, checkered: 16 * (25%) * (25%) = 16 * 6.25% = 1 bird\n- Red, brown: 16 * (25%) * (50%) = 16 * 12.5% = 2 birds\n- Plain, checkered: 16 * (25%) * (25%) = 1 bird\n- Plain, brown: 16 * (25%) * (50%) = 4 birds\n\nWait, but that adds up to 8 birds, which isn't matching the options. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to ignore dominance and consider all possible combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each phenotype, giving a total of 4 phenotypes. But looking at the options, some have 6 phenotypic categories, others don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me go back.\n\nThe question states: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So adihybridcross implies two traits, each with two alleles.\n\nThe Punnett square would involve the F1 crossed with itself (F1 \u00d7 F1).\n\nWait, perhaps I was too quick before. Let me construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nF1 will be CcBb (as each parent contributes one allele, so Cc and Bb).\n\nWhen F1 \u00d7 F1, the F2 will have:\n\nGametes from Parent 1: CB and cb (each at 50%)\nGametes from Parent 2: CB and cb (each at 50%)\n\nSo F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (Red, Checkered)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (Red, Brown)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (Red, Brown)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (Plain, Checkered)\n\nThus, in F2:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Red, Checkered\n- CcBb: Red, Brown\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nRed, Checkered : Red, Brown : Plain, Checkered\n\nWhich translates to 25% : 50% : 25%, or 1:2:1 in terms of proportion.\n\nBut none of the options directly reflect this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\u2192 18 total, but according to my calculation, it's 4 parts.\n\nB.

Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\u2192 16 total, fits\n\nBut none of the options exactly match 1:2:1 or similar. However, looking closer, option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, so probably not. Option K is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16, which is correct. Option M is 4:4:4:4, same as K.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at the user's message, he listed options A through Z, but in the original query, he pasted several letters like A, B, ..., E, F, etc. But in the user's last line, he wrote:\n\n\"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{J}.\"\n\nSo he must have meant to choose among J, K, etc. Looking back, I previously thought that option K is 4:4:4:4, which seems plausible. But another approach is to count the possible combinations of the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, each bird can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the combination of their two traits. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both dominant for C and B: CC BB \u2192 Red, Checkered\n2. C dominant, B recessive: CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: cC BB \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n4. Both recessive: cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, no, because B is brown if B is present. So:\n\n- CC (red) and BB (checkered): Red, Checkered\n- CC (red) and Bb (brown): Red, Brown\n- cc (plain) and BB (checkered): Plain, Checkered\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown): Plain, Brown\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red, Checkered\n2. Red, Brown\n3. Plain, Checkered\n4. Plain, Brown\n\nNow, calculating the proportion in the F2 generation:\n\n- For each bird, the probability of having the dominant C and dominant B is 25% (since each gene is independently dominant).\n- The probability of having dominant C and recessive B is 25% (C dominant, B recessive).\n- The probability of having recessive C and dominant B is 25% (c recessive, B dominant).\n- The probability of having recessive C and recessive B is 25% (cc bb).\n\nHowever, the phenotype is determined by both genes, so each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n- Red, Checkered: Only when both C and B are dominant (probability 25%).\n- Red, Brown: When C is dominant but B is recessive (25%).\n- Plain, Checkered: When C is recessive but B is dominant (25%).\n- Plain, Brown: When both C and B are recessive (25%).\n\nThus, each phenotype should occur at 25% frequency in the F2 generation. But wait, that would mean four phenotypes each occurring once, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options list a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption K: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16 total, all equal.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which doesn't add up to 16. So likely not.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me reconsider.\n\nIf both genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as:\n\n- Red, Checkered: CC BB \u2192 (25% for C) * (25% for B) = 6.25%\n- Red, Brown: (25% for C) * (50% for B) = 12.5%\n- Plain, Checkered: (50% for C) * (25% for B) = 12.5%\n- Plain, Brown: (50% for C) * (50% for B) = 25%\n\nAdding these percentages: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%, which exceeds 100%, indicating a mistake. That can't be right. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Punnett square counts each possibility correctly, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the actual counts in the F2 generation.\n\nIn reality, when crossing a dihybrid with itself, the phenotypic ratio is often 9:3:3:1, but depending on the dominance hierarchy. However, in this case, since the dominant allele masks the recessive, the phenotypes would follow a 1:2:1:1 ratio, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to consider that each trait is segregating independently, so the total number of phenotypes is 2^2 = 4, each with equal representation, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Thus, each phenotype would occur equally in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which is option K. But looking back, none of the options list K as the correct choice.\n\nWait, let me verify. If the F2 generation is 16 birds, and each phenotype occurs once, then each would have 4 birds. So the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which is option K.\n\nBut I initially thought that the correct ratio was 1:2:1:1, which would correspond to 16 birds split into 1, 2, 1, 1, totaling 5, which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that usually applies to three traits. Here, we have two traits, so it",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the actual segregation might differ if there are any lethal traits or if the parents are producing different gametes. In our case, let's proceed under standard Mendelian assumptions.\n\nNow, considering the phenotypes:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. Let's consider each gene separately first, then combine them.\n\nGene C: \n- C (red) \n- c (plain)\n\nGene B: \n- B (brown) \n- b (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, we can analyze each independently and then combine the results.\n\nFirst, let's look at the phenotype ratios for each gene without considering the other.\n\nFor Gene C:\n- If both alleles are C (CC or Cc), the bird is red.\n- If both are c (cc), it's plain.\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n- If both are B (BB or Bb), the bird is brown.\n- If both are b (bb), it's checkered.\n\nBut since the question is about a dihybrid cross, we'll need to consider the combination of these two traits.\n\nWait, but the question specifies a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing F1.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1. F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb = CcBb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB = CcBb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nSo the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red, checkered)\n- 25% CcBb (red, brown)\n- 25% CcBb (red, brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because in a typical dihybrid cross, we'd expect certain ratios for each trait. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross between the two parents, i.e., F1 \u00d7 F1. But the options given include various ratios, so let's see what each option says.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the F2 generation.\n\nF1 is CcBb. Each gamete is either CB or cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo F2 would have:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB \u2192 red, checkered\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb \u2192 red, brown\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: same as above\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red, checkered)\n- 50% CcBb (red, brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- For each bird, if it's CC (red) and BB (checkered): red, checkered\n- CC (red) and Bb (brown): red, brown\n- cc (plain) and BB (checkered): plain, checkered\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown): plain, brown\n\nSo the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Red, checkered (CC BB)\n2. Red, brown (CC Bb)\n3. Plain, checkered (cc BB)\n4. Plain, brown (cc Bb)\n\nNow, the ratios would depend on how many of each genotype exist in the F2.\n\nFrom the Punnett square, each genotype occurs as follows:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB \u2192 red, checkered\n- 2/4 CcBb \u2192 red, brown\n- 1/4 cc bb \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014because each F2 bird has two alleles for each gene, so the probabilities are additive. For example, for Gene C:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50% (since Cc is half of the remaining)\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for Gene B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of a bird being red (for Gene C) and brown (for Gene B) is 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5%, etc.\n\nSo let's compute the phenotypic ratios:\n\n1. Red, checkered: This occurs when the bird is CC (red) and bb (checkered). The probability is 25% for CC and 25% for bb, so 25% * 25% = 6.25% or 1/16.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Wait, the presence of two dominant alleles is independent. So the probability of being red (at least one dominant C) is 75%, but in terms of checking whether it's red, the only way to get red is if the bird is CC or Cc. Similarly, being checkered depends on the B gene.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of birds in each phenotype category.\n\nAssuming a large population, say 16 birds (to make calculations easy):\n\n- Number of red, checkered: 16 * (25%) * (25%) = 16 * 6.25% = 1 bird\n- Red, brown: 16 * (25%) * (50%) = 16 * 12.5% = 2 birds\n- Plain, checkered: 16 * (25%) * (25%) = 1 bird\n- Plain, brown: 16 * (25%) * (50%) = 4 birds\n\nWait, but that adds up to 8 birds, which isn't matching the options. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to ignore dominance and consider all possible combinations, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each phenotype, giving a total of 4 phenotypes. But looking at the options, some have 6 phenotypic categories, others don't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me go back.\n\nThe question states: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So adihybridcross implies two traits, each with two alleles.\n\nThe Punnett square would involve the F1 crossed with itself (F1 \u00d7 F1).\n\nWait, perhaps I was too quick before. Let me construct the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 CC BB\nParent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nF1 will be CcBb (as each parent contributes one allele, so Cc and Bb).\n\nWhen F1 \u00d7 F1, the F2 will have:\n\nGametes from Parent 1: CB and cb (each at 50%)\nGametes from Parent 2: CB and cb (each at 50%)\n\nSo F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (Red, Checkered)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (Red, Brown)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (Red, Brown)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (Plain, Checkered)\n\nThus, in F2:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Red, Checkered\n- CcBb: Red, Brown\n- cc bb: Plain, Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nRed, Checkered : Red, Brown : Plain, Checkered\n\nWhich translates to 25% : 50% : 25%, or 1:2:1 in terms of proportion.\n\nBut none of the options directly reflect this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\u2192 18 total, but according to my calculation, it's 4 parts.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\u2192 16 total, which could be 8:4:0:4, but that's inconsistent.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\u2192 Total 16, which aligns with 9+3+3+1=16\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\u2192 16 total, which also matches\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\u2192 16 total, consistent\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\u2192 16 total, all equal\n\nG.

Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\u2192 16 total, doesn't fit\n\nS. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\u2192 16 total, fits\n\nT. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\u2192 16 total, fits\n\nU. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\u2192 16 total, all equal\n\nV. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\u2192 16 total, fits\n\nW. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\u2192 16 total, fits\n\nX.

Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\u2192 16 total, fits\n\nBut none of the options exactly match 1:2:1 or similar. However, looking closer, option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, so probably not. Option K is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16, which is correct. Option M is 4:4:4:4, same as K.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at the user's message, he listed options A through Z, but in the original query, he pasted several letters like A, B, ..., E, F, etc. But in the user's last line, he wrote:\n\n\"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{J}.\"\n\nSo he must have meant to choose among J, K, etc. Looking back, I previously thought that option K is 4:4:4:4, which seems plausible. But another approach is to count the possible combinations of the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, each bird can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the combination of their two traits. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both dominant for C and B: CC BB \u2192 Red, Checkered\n2. C dominant, B recessive: CC Bb \u2192 Red, Brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant: cC BB \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n4. Both recessive: cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nWait, no, because B is brown if B is present. So:\n\n- CC (red) and BB (checkered): Red, Checkered\n- CC (red) and Bb (brown): Red, Brown\n- cc (plain) and BB (checkered): Plain, Checkered\n- cc (plain) and Bb (brown): Plain, Brown\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red, Checkered\n2. Red, Brown\n3. Plain, Checkered\n4. Plain, Brown\n\nNow, calculating the proportion in the F2 generation:\n\n- For each bird, the probability of having the dominant C and dominant B is 25% (since each gene is independently dominant).\n- The probability of having dominant C and recessive B is 25% (C dominant, B recessive).\n- The probability of having recessive C and dominant B is 25% (c recessive, B dominant).\n- The probability of having recessive C and recessive B is 25% (cc bb).\n\nHowever, the phenotype is determined by both genes, so each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations:\n\n- Red, Checkered: Only when both C and B are dominant (probability 25%).\n- Red, Brown: When C is dominant but B is recessive (25%).\n- Plain, Checkered: When C is recessive but B is dominant (25%).\n- Plain, Brown: When both C and B are recessive (25%).\n\nThus, each phenotype should occur at 25% frequency in the F2 generation. But wait, that would mean four phenotypes each occurring once, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options list a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption K: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16 total, all equal.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which doesn't add up to 16. So likely not.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me reconsider.\n\nIf both genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as:\n\n- Red, Checkered: CC BB \u2192 (25% for C) * (25% for B) = 6.25%\n- Red, Brown: (25% for C) * (50% for B) = 12.5%\n- Plain, Checkered: (50% for C) * (25% for B) = 12.5%\n- Plain, Brown: (50% for C) * (50% for B) = 25%\n\nAdding these percentages: 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 25 = 56.25%, which exceeds 100%, indicating a mistake. That can't be right. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Punnett square counts each possibility correctly, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the actual counts in the F2 generation.\n\nIn reality, when crossing a dihybrid with itself, the phenotypic ratio is often 9:3:3:1, but depending on the dominance hierarchy. However, in this case, since the dominant allele masks the recessive, the phenotypes would follow a 1:2:1:1 ratio, but I'm getting confused now.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to consider that each trait is segregating independently, so the total number of phenotypes is 2^2 = 4, each with equal representation, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Thus, each phenotype would occur equally in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which is option K. But looking back, none of the options list K as the correct choice.\n\nWait, let me verify. If the F2 generation is 16 birds, and each phenotype occurs once, then each would have 4 birds. So the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, which is option K.\n\nBut I initially thought that the correct ratio was 1:2:1:1, which would correspond to 16 birds split into 1, 2, 1, 1, totaling 5, which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that usually applies to three traits. Here, we have two traits, so it",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, if the parents are producing different gametes due to dominance, but in this case, the parents are homozygous.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, if the parents are producing different gametes due to dominance, but in this case, the parents are homozygous. So all gametes are either CB or cb. Hence, F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s the case if each parent contributes a gamete randomly, but since both parents are homozygous, the gametes are all the same. So F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but the question mentions an F2 generation where each bird is a F2, which typically refers to the second generation after selfing. However, the options given seem to suggest that the answer is among A to H, which include various phenotypic ratios.\n\nNow, moving to the phenotype determination. Each bird has two genes: C and B. The dominant alleles are C and B, while the recessives are c and b. The colors are determined by the presence of B (brown) or b (checkered). Pigmentation is also influenced by the presence of C (red) or c (plain). So, the phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list the possible genotypes and then determine the phenotype:\n\nPossible genotypes for C:\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nPossible genotypes for B:\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nSo, the combination of these gives the phenotype. Let's make a grid:\n\n- CC x BB \u2192 red x brown = red-brown\n- CC x Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC x bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc x BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc x bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc x BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc x Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc x bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach bird is produced equally, so the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by counting how many of each phenotype there are. Let's count:\n\n- red-brown: CCxBB (1/4), CCxBb (1/4), CcxBB (1/4?), Wait no. Wait, the F2 generation is 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. But considering the interaction of C and B:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. Since C and B are independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red) x BB (brown): red-brown\n2. CC x Bb: red-brown\n3. CC x bb: red-checkered\n4. Cc x BB: red-brown\n5. Cc x Bb: red-brown\n6. Cc x bb: red-checkered\n7. cc x BB: plain-brown\n8. cc x Bb: plain-brown\n9. cc x bb: plain-checkered\n\nSince all four genotypes are equally likely (25%), each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. But wait, some phenotypes may overlap. For example, red-brown and red-checkered might combine into something else, but according to the problem statement, each bird has a unique phenotype based on the combination of C and B. So, the total phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red-brown\n2. Red-checkered\n3. Plain-brown\n4. Plain-checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many of each:\n\n- Red-brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Red-checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain-brown: Case 7 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain-checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6,2, etc.\nB. 8,4\nC. 9,3, etc.\nD. 1,3, etc.\nE. 3,9\nF. 4,4\nG. 12,2\nH.5,3\nI.7,5\nJ.2,6\nK.4,4\n\nWait, none of them exactly match my calculation. Hmm. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about F2 but F1? Because the original parents are homozygous, and the cross described seems like F1. But looking back, the user said \"adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So probably F1. But the question asks for F2. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps I misinterpreted the cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is between F1 (which is CcBb) and itself (so F2), leading to the Punnett square as per the user's description. So, let's go back to that.\n\nThe user lists the gametes for F1 as:\n\nGametes: (CB), (cb) \u2014 no, wait, they listed F1's gametes as (CB) and (cb) with counts. Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"Gametes: (CB) (cb)\"\n\n\"F1 \u00d7 F1 CcBB \u00d7 ccbb\"\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo. Actually, the F1 would be CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc for both genes. Let me consider the actual F2.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- CC (red) with any B: red\n- CC with any b: red (since bb is still present)\n- Cc (red) with any B: red\n- Cc (red) with any b: red\n- cc (plain) with any B: plain\n- cc (plain) with any b: plain\n\nBut wait, the presence of B or b affects the phenotype beyond just being red or plain. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, if a bird is CC (red) and BB (brown), it's red-brown. If it's Cc (red) and bb (checkered), it's red-checkered. If it's cc (plain) and BB (brown), it's plain-brown. And if it's cc (plain) and bb (checkered), it's plain-checkered.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-Brown\n2. Red-Checkered\n3. Plain-Brown\n4. Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, what's the proportion of each in F2? Let's calculate.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the loci assort independently, the combined phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the percentages for each trait.\n\nBut instead of doing that, let's consider all possible combinations:\n\nTotal phenotypes = 4 (as above).\n\nTo find the frequency of each:\n\n1. Red-Brown: This occurs when the bird is CC (red) and BB (brown) or CC and bb (brown). So,\n\n- CC (red) * BB (brown) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC (red) * bb (brown) = 6.25%\nTotal for Red-Brown: 12.5%\n\n2.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, if the parents are producing different gametes due to dominance, but in this case, the parents are homozygous. So all gametes are either CB or cb. Hence, F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s the case if each parent contributes a gamete randomly, but since both parents are homozygous, the gametes are all the same. So F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but the question mentions an F2 generation where each bird is a F2, which typically refers to the second generation after selfing. However, the options given seem to suggest that the answer is among A to H, which include various phenotypic ratios.\n\nNow, moving to the phenotype determination. Each bird has two genes: C and B. The dominant alleles are C and B, while the recessives are c and b. The colors are determined by the presence of B (brown) or b (checkered). Pigmentation is also influenced by the presence of C (red) or c (plain). So, the phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list the possible genotypes and then determine the phenotype:\n\nPossible genotypes for C:\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nPossible genotypes for B:\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nSo, the combination of these gives the phenotype. Let's make a grid:\n\n- CC x BB \u2192 red x brown = red-brown\n- CC x Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- CC x bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- Cc x BB \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 red-brown\n- Cc x bb \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc x BB \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc x Bb \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc x bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nEach bird is produced equally, so the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by counting how many of each phenotype there are. Let's count:\n\n- red-brown: CCxBB (1/4), CCxBb (1/4), CcxBB (1/4?), Wait no. Wait, the F2 generation is 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. But considering the interaction of C and B:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. Since C and B are independently assorting, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each gene.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nLet me list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red) x BB (brown): red-brown\n2. CC x Bb: red-brown\n3. CC x bb: red-checkered\n4. Cc x BB: red-brown\n5. Cc x Bb: red-brown\n6. Cc x bb: red-checkered\n7. cc x BB: plain-brown\n8. cc x Bb: plain-brown\n9. cc x bb: plain-checkered\n\nSince all four genotypes are equally likely (25%), each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. But wait, some phenotypes may overlap. For example, red-brown and red-checkered might combine into something else, but according to the problem statement, each bird has a unique phenotype based on the combination of C and B. So, the total phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red-brown\n2. Red-checkered\n3. Plain-brown\n4. Plain-checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many of each:\n\n- Red-brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Red-checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain-brown: Case 7 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain-checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6,2, etc.\nB. 8,4\nC. 9,3, etc.\nD. 1,3, etc.\nE. 3,9\nF. 4,4\nG. 12,2\nH.5,3\nI.7,5\nJ.2,6\nK.4,4\n\nWait, none of them exactly match my calculation. Hmm. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about F2 but F1? Because the original parents are homozygous, and the cross described seems like F1. But looking back, the user said \"adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So probably F1. But the question asks for F2. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps I misinterpreted the cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross is between F1 (which is CcBb) and itself (so F2), leading to the Punnett square as per the user's description. So, let's go back to that.\n\nThe user lists the gametes for F1 as:\n\nGametes: (CB), (cb) \u2014 no, wait, they listed F1's gametes as (CB) and (cb) with counts. Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"Gametes: (CB) (cb)\"\n\n\"F1 \u00d7 F1 CcBB \u00d7 ccbb\"\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo. Actually, the F1 would be CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc for both genes. Let me consider the actual F2.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- CC (red) with any B: red\n- CC with any b: red (since bb is still present)\n- Cc (red) with any B: red\n- Cc (red) with any b: red\n- cc (plain) with any B: plain\n- cc (plain) with any b: plain\n\nBut wait, the presence of B or b affects the phenotype beyond just being red or plain. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So, if a bird is CC (red) and BB (brown), it's red-brown. If it's Cc (red) and bb (checkered), it's red-checkered. If it's cc (plain) and BB (brown), it's plain-brown. And if it's cc (plain) and bb (checkered), it's plain-checkered.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-Brown\n2. Red-Checkered\n3. Plain-Brown\n4. Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, what's the proportion of each in F2? Let's calculate.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the loci assort independently, the combined phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the percentages for each trait.\n\nBut instead of doing that, let's consider all possible combinations:\n\nTotal phenotypes = 4 (as above).\n\nTo find the frequency of each:\n\n1. Red-Brown: This occurs when the bird is CC (red) and BB (brown) or CC and bb (brown). So,\n\n- CC (red) * BB (brown) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC (red) * bb (brown) = 6.25%\nTotal for Red-Brown: 12.5%\n\n2. Red-Checkered: This occurs when the bird is Cc (red) and bb (checkered).\n\n- Cc (red) * bb (checkered) = 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nSo, Red-Checkered: 12.5%\n\n3. Plain-Brown: This occurs when the bird is cc (plain) and BB (brown).\n\n- cc (plain) * BB (brown) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nSo, Plain-Brown: 6.25%\n\n4. Plain-Checkered: This occurs when the bird is cc (plain) and bb (checkered).\n\n- cc (plain) * bb (checkered) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 37.5%. That doesn't add up to 100%, indicating a miscalculation.\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue is that when calculating phenotypic ratios, sometimes overlapping is considered. Let me try another approach: considering the possible phenotypes and their frequencies.\n\nEach bird has four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red-Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red-Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain-Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red-Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 cases\n- Red-Checkered: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain-Brown: Cases 7 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain-Checkered: Cases 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nSo, the ratios are 4:2:1:1.\n\nBut the options don't have this exact ratio. Looking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,...\n\nH. 5,3,...\n\nI.7,5,...\n\nJ.2,6,...\n\nSo none match 4:2:1:1. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation is not being interpreted correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different cross. Alternatively, maybe the question is about F1 instead of F2.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, the actual F2 would depend on whether the genes assort independently, which they do in most cases.",
    "rollout": " However, the actual F2 would depend on whether the genes assort independently, which they do in most cases. So the F2 genotypes would be 25% CC BB, 25% Cc Bb, 25% cc bb, 25% cc BB. But wait, in reality, the presence of one allele affects the segregation of another due to dominance. So if C is dominant over c, then CC and Cc will express the same phenotype for C, and similarly for B. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we're considering all genotypes regardless of phenotype.\n\nWait, but the question is about phenotypes, not genotypes. So we'll look at the phenotypic ratios based on the genotypes. Let's map the genotypes to phenotypes. The genes are independent (assuming Mendelian inheritance): \n\n- C: Red (dominant) vs plain (recessive)\n- B: Brown (dominant) vs checkered (recessive)\n\nSo:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have four genotypes, each with certain probabilities. From F2, we can calculate the phenotypic ratios. Let's compute the number of each genotype. Since each parent contributes gametes in a 50% ratio, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CC BB: (50% CB)(50% CB) = 25%\n- Cc Bb: (50% CB)(50% cb) + (50% cb)(50% CB) = 50%\n- cc BB: (50% cb)(50% cb) = 25%\n- cc Bb: (50% cb)(50% cb) = 25%\n\nBut wait, let me make sure: Each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb. So when F1 selfs, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (50%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb (another 50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are indeed 25% CC BB, 50% Cc Bb, and 25% cc bb. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n\nEach of these is 25%, 50%, and 25% respectively. So the phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 50%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nWait, but looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide different ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which seems too low. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation without considering dominance. Let me try recalculating the F2 genotypes differently. If the F1 is CcBb, and it selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain\n- bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% Checkered Red\n- 25% Checkered Brown\n- 25% Plain Red\n- 25% Plain Brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed among the options. Wait, but looking at option G, it says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 16. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. In some contexts, dominance might affect the segregation of alleles beyond simple percentages. However, standard Mendelian calculations assume independent assortment and simple segregation. So under those assumptions, each F2 individual has a 25% chance of each genotype, leading to equal phenotypic ratios.\n\nGiven that, none of the options match perfectly. Let me double-check the original question to ensure I understood it correctly. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, along with the genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. The options provided don't align with my calculation. Perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the F2 refers to the F2 generation after a dihybrid cross, but the parent's genotypes are different. Let me re-examine the parent genotypes. One parent is CC BB (homozygous dominant), and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. As before, F2 genotypes would be 25% CC BB, 50% Cc Bb, 25% cc BB, and 25% cc bb. Applying dominance:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which corresponds to 25% each. None of the options reflect this exact ratio, except possibly option G, which states checkered red 12, etc., totaling 16. That suggests that perhaps the options are scaled differently, maybe considering approximate numbers or rounding errors. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 rather than F2, but that wouldn't make sense because the question specifies F2.\n\nLooking again at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. This could correspond to a different approach where each F2 individual's contribution to the next generation is weighted differently. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of each type of bird instead of the phenotypic ratio directly. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio relative to the total, considering only the phenotypically distinct categories. In any case, based on standard Mendelian genetics, the F2 would exhibit a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Among the options provided, option G seems to fit better when considering a different approach, such as counting the number of each genotype and then their phenotypic representation.\n\nWait, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That totals to 16 birds, which is 25% each. So perhaps the options are intended to represent the number of birds rather than percentages, implying that each bird contributes equally to the next generation. Under this interpretation, each F2 bird has an equal chance to pass on their alleles, leading to the same phenotypic ratio.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the confusion, the correct phenotypic ratio based on standard Mendelian genetics would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't explicitly listed. However, if we interpret the options as counting the number of birds rather than their proportion, then option G fits, showing 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown. This could be the intended answer, especially if the question is expecting a count-based ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

So the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 (red, checkered)\n- Cc Bb: 2/4 (red, brown)\n- cc bb: 1/4 (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, considering phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB and cc BB\n- Plain red: cc BB (wait, no, cc would be plain, regardless of B)\nWait, no, because in terms of phenotype, it's based on both genes. If a bird is checkered (cc), it's always plain, right? Because 'c' is recessive for both genes. Wait no: 'c' is recessive for gene C (so if you have cc, you are plain) and recessive for gene B as well (since 'b' is recessive for B). So any bird with 'cc' in both genes will be plain, regardless of the B trait.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotype:\n\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 plain, whether B is present or not.\n- Plain (cc) \u2192 depends on B. If B is present (BB or Bb), then it's brown; else, plain.\n\nSimilarly, red (either CC or Cc):\n\n- CC \u2192 red, checkered\n- Cc \u2192 red, brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes in F2 would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1/4)\n- Checkered plain: cc BB (1/4)\n- Plain red: Cc BB (2/4) [because Cc Bb is red, brown]\n- Plain plain: cc Bb (2/4) [because Bb is brown]\n\nWait, but wait: No, because B is expressed only if B is present. So:\n\n- If a bird is CC or Cc (i.e., C is dominant), it's red. If it's cc, it's plain.\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- All birds with C present (CC or Cc) \u2192 red, checkered (phenotype)\n- All birds with c present (cc) \u2192 plain, regardless of B.\n\nThen, within the C present group:\n\n- Those with BB or Bb \u2192 brown\n- Those with bb \u2192 plain\n\nWithin the cc group:\n\n- Those with BB or Bb \u2192 brown\n- Those with bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1/4)\n- Checkered plain: cc BB (1/4)\n- Plain red: Cc BB (2/4)\n- Plain plain: cc Bb (2/4)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:2:2.

Wait, but in the options, option F says 4,4,4,4\u2014which doesn't match.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of birds.

Cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Plain checkered\n5. cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n6. cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. In reality, there are only four types of gametes contributing to F2, each producing 25% of the total. So the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (1/4)\n2. Cc Bb (2/4)\n3. cc BB (1/4)\n4. cc Bb (1/4)\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1/4)\n- Checkered plain: cc BB (1/4)\n- Plain red: Cc BB (2/4)\n- Plain brown: Cc Bb (2/4)\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypic classes:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered plain: 1 part\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 2 parts\n\nTotal = 1+1+2+2=6 parts. So the ratio is 1:1:2:2, which corresponds to checkered red : checkered plain : plain red : plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me consider the number of birds:\n\nIn F2, each parent produces 4 gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations. However, due to Mendelian ratios, certain combinations occur. Specifically, the four types are:\n\n1. 1:1 (for C and B) \u2192 4 outcomes (e.g., CB, CB, CB, CB?) Wait, no\u2014it's 1/4 each, totaling 16 birds. So:\n\n- CC BB: 4 birds (1 from each parent's gamete combination)\n- Cc Bb: 8 birds (2 from each parent's gamete combination)\n- cc BB: 4 birds\n- cc Bb: 4 birds\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each F1 (CcBb) produces 2 types of gametes: CB and cb, each 50%. So F2 would have four types:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 25%\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 25%\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 25%\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 25%\n\nEach type contributes 25% of the population. So:\n\n- 1/4 of the birds: CC BB (checkered red)\n- 1/4: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- 1/4: cc BB (plain checkered)\n- 1/4: cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nNow, converting this into counts:\n\nIf there are N birds in total, say N=16 for simplicity:\n\n- CC BB: 4 birds (checkered red)\n- Cc Bb: 8 birds (checkered brown)\n- cc BB: 4 birds (plain checkered)\n- cc Bb: 4 birds (plain brown)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n- Checkered plain: 4 birds\n- Plain red: 8 birds\n- Plain brown: 4 birds\n\nSo the ratio is 4:4:8:4. Simplifying by dividing each by 4 gives 1:1:2:1.\n\nWait, no, simplifying 4:4:8:4 is 1:1:2:1. That doesn't match any of the options exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Also doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 6,2,2,2. Hmm, not matching.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me try again. If F2 is 16 birds:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB \u2192 4 birds (red, checkered)\n- 1/4 Cc Bb \u2192 8 birds (red, brown)\n- 1/4 cc BB \u2192 4 birds (plain, checkered)\n- 1/4 cc Bb \u2192 4 birds (plain, brown)\n\nSo phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered plain: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nRatio: 4:4:8:4 \u2192 which simplifies to 1:1:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to match. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided don't include 1:1:2:1, but option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 is being considered differently. Wait, the F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. The F1 was CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 has 16 birds, with the distribution as above. But the options don't reflect 1:1:2:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says \"the F2 generation.\" Wait, perhaps the user is confused about the generations. The F1 is from a homozygous parent (CC BB) \u00d7 a heterozygous parent (cc bb), resulting in F1 (CcBb). Then F1 \u00d7 F1 results in F2. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Let me see:\n\n- All checkered (cc) are plain, regardless of B. So those are separate from red.\n\n- Among red (CC or Cc), some are brown (Cc Bb) and others are plain (cc Bb).\n\n- Among plain (cc), some are brown (cc Bb) and others are plain (cc bb).\n\nSo the groups are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 1/4\n2. Checkered plain: cc BB \u2192 1/4\n3. Plain red: cc Bb \u2192 2/4 (since Cc Bb is brown)\n4. Plain brown: cc BB and Cc Bb? Wait, no. Within cc:\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo among plain:\n\n- 2/4 (cc Bb) \u2192 brown\n- 2/4 (cc bb) \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered plain: 1 part\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 2 parts\n\nWhich totals 6 parts. So the ratio is 1:1:2:2.\n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but assuming the options are correct, maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of birds as follows:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce 4 types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb? No, wait, the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- CB: from C and B\n- cb: from c and b\n- cB: same as CB?\nWait, no, actually, the gametes are determined by the alleles. The F1 is CcBb, so it can produce:\n\n- CB (from C and B)\n- cb (from c and b)\n- cB (same as cb?)\nWait, no, actually, the gametes are determined by each homolog separately. So the gametes are:\n\n- From Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the possible gametes are:\n\n- CB\n- Cb\n- cB\n- cb\n\nEach with a 25% chance. So the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- 25% CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- 25% cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- 25% cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nThus, the four genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (checkered red)\n- Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- cc bb (plain checkered)\n\nSo, phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered plain: 1 part\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 2 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 1:1:2:2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- None seems to match exactly. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which isn't matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read again:\n\nThe adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 is CcBb. Then F1 \u00d7 F1 (F2) is considered.\n\nBut perhaps the question refers to a dihybrid cross where both parents are CcBB and ccbb, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the dihybrid cross is between two CcBB and ccbb, but that's not what the question states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including recombinant types, but under Mendelian inheritance, there are no recombinants because the traits are not linked. So the F2 should have only the four types I've listed.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:2:2, which isn't reflected in the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that sums up to 16 birds (5+3+2+6=16). Let's see how many fall into each category:\n\n- Checkered red: 5 birds \u2192 5/16\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: 2 birds \u2192 2/16\n- Plain brown: 6 birds \u2192 6/16\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with our previous calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me see:\n\nIf F2 is 16 birds, and the phenotypic breakdown is 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown, that totals 16. So the ratio is 5:3:2:6. But that's not the same as our expectation of 1:1:2:2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the problem, but given the options, I think the intended answer might be option H, as it sums to 16 and shows the numbers as 5,3,2,6, but without understanding why, I'm unsure. Another possibility is that the user mixed up the cross types, but based on the analysis, the correct ratio isn't among the options. However, since the user expects an answer, I'll proceed with the most plausible option, which seems to be option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some phenotypes might combine. Alternatively, another approach: each parent contributes either CB or cb. The F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (red, checkered)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc Bb (red, brown)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: Cc Bb (red, brown)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nBut since gametes are equally likely, the probabilities would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red, checkered)\n- 25% Cc Bb (red, brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (red, brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, but this counts twice for Cc Bb. So the actual F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 (red, checkered)\n- Cc Bb: 2/4 (red, brown)\n- cc bb: 1/4 (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, considering phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB and cc BB\n- Plain red: cc BB (wait, no, cc would be plain, regardless of B)\nWait, no, because in terms of phenotype, it's based on both genes. If a bird is checkered (cc), it's always plain, right? Because 'c' is recessive for both genes. Wait no: 'c' is recessive for gene C (so if you have cc, you are plain) and recessive for gene B as well (since 'b' is recessive for B). So any bird with 'cc' in both genes will be plain, regardless of the B trait.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotype:\n\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 plain, whether B is present or not.\n- Plain (cc) \u2192 depends on B. If B is present (BB or Bb), then it's brown; else, plain.\n\nSimilarly, red (either CC or Cc):\n\n- CC \u2192 red, checkered\n- Cc \u2192 red, brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes in F2 would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1/4)\n- Checkered plain: cc BB (1/4)\n- Plain red: Cc BB (2/4) [because Cc Bb is red, brown]\n- Plain plain: cc Bb (2/4) [because Bb is brown]\n\nWait, but wait: No, because B is expressed only if B is present. So:\n\n- If a bird is CC or Cc (i.e., C is dominant), it's red. If it's cc, it's plain.\n\nSo, in F2:\n\n- All birds with C present (CC or Cc) \u2192 red, checkered (phenotype)\n- All birds with c present (cc) \u2192 plain, regardless of B.\n\nThen, within the C present group:\n\n- Those with BB or Bb \u2192 brown\n- Those with bb \u2192 plain\n\nWithin the cc group:\n\n- Those with BB or Bb \u2192 brown\n- Those with bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1/4)\n- Checkered plain: cc BB (1/4)\n- Plain red: Cc BB (2/4)\n- Plain plain: cc Bb (2/4)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:2:2. But looking at the options given:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 plain red, etc.\u2014doesn't match.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\u2014doesn't fit.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\u2014nope.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\u2192No.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4\u2192Hmm, this matches my calculation where checkered red:1, plain red:2, but wait, according to my earlier count, it's 1 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain plain, and 2 checkered plain. Wait, but in the options, option F says 4,4,4,4\u2014which doesn't match.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of birds. Let me recount.\n\nEach F2 generation has four types of offspring:\n\n1. CC BB: 1/4 of total \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Plain checkered\n5. cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n6. cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. In reality, there are only four types of gametes contributing to F2, each producing 25% of the total. So the four possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (1/4)\n2. Cc Bb (2/4)\n3. cc BB (1/4)\n4. cc Bb (1/4)\n\nNow, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1/4)\n- Checkered plain: cc BB (1/4)\n- Plain red: Cc BB (2/4)\n- Plain brown: Cc Bb (2/4)\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypic classes:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered plain: 1 part\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 2 parts\n\nTotal = 1+1+2+2=6 parts. So the ratio is 1:1:2:2, which corresponds to checkered red : checkered plain : plain red : plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this ratio. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.

So F2 would have four types:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 25%\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 25%\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 25%\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 25%\n\nEach type contributes 25% of the population. So:\n\n- 1/4 of the birds: CC BB (checkered red)\n- 1/4: Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- 1/4: cc BB (plain checkered)\n- 1/4: cc Bb (plain brown)\n\nNow, converting this into counts:\n\nIf there are N birds in total, say N=16 for simplicity:\n\n- CC BB: 4 birds (checkered red)\n- Cc Bb: 8 birds (checkered brown)\n- cc BB: 4 birds (plain checkered)\n- cc Bb: 4 birds (plain brown)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 birds\n- Checkered plain: 4 birds\n- Plain red: 8 birds\n- Plain brown: 4 birds\n\nSo the ratio is 4:4:8:4. Simplifying by dividing each by 4 gives 1:1:2:1.\n\nWait, no, simplifying 4:4:8:4 is 1:1:2:1. That doesn't match any of the options exactly. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Also doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 6,2,2,2. Hmm, not matching.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me try again. If F2 is 16 birds:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB \u2192 4 birds (red, checkered)\n- 1/4 Cc Bb \u2192 8 birds (red, brown)\n- 1/4 cc BB \u2192 4 birds (plain, checkered)\n- 1/4 cc Bb \u2192 4 birds (plain, brown)\n\nSo phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered plain: 4\n- Plain red: 8\n- Plain brown: 4\n\nRatio: 4:4:8:4 \u2192 which simplifies to 1:1:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to match. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided don't include 1:1:2:1, but option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 is being considered differently. Wait, the F2 generation comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. The F1 was CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 has 16 birds, with the distribution as above. But the options don't reflect 1:1:2:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says \"the F2 generation.\" Wait, perhaps the user is confused about the generations. The F1 is from a homozygous parent (CC BB) \u00d7 a heterozygous parent (cc bb), resulting in F1 (CcBb). Then F1 \u00d7 F1 results in F2. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Let me see:\n\n- All checkered (cc) are plain, regardless of B. So those are separate from red.\n\n- Among red (CC or Cc), some are brown (Cc Bb) and others are plain (cc Bb).\n\n- Among plain (cc), some are brown (cc Bb) and others are plain (cc bb).\n\nSo the groups are:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC BB \u2192 1/4\n2. Checkered plain: cc BB \u2192 1/4\n3. Plain red: cc Bb \u2192 2/4 (since Cc Bb is brown)\n4. Plain brown: cc BB and Cc Bb? Wait, no. Within cc:\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo among plain:\n\n- 2/4 (cc Bb) \u2192 brown\n- 2/4 (cc bb) \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered plain: 1 part\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 2 parts\n\nWhich totals 6 parts. So the ratio is 1:1:2:2.\n\nLooking back at the options, none exactly match this. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but assuming the options are correct, maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of birds as follows:\n\nEach F1 (CcBb) can produce 4 types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb? No, wait, the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- CB: from C and B\n- cb: from c and b\n- cB: same as CB?\nWait, no, actually, the gametes are determined by the alleles. The F1 is CcBb, so it can produce:\n\n- CB (from C and B)\n- cb (from c and b)\n- cB (same as cb?)\nWait, no, actually, the gametes are determined by each homolog separately. So the gametes are:\n\n- From Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the possible gametes are:\n\n- CB\n- Cb\n- cB\n- cb\n\nEach with a 25% chance. So the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- 25% CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- 25% cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- 25% cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nThus, the four genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (checkered red)\n- Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- Cc Bb (checkered brown)\n- cc bb (plain checkered)\n\nSo, phenotypically:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered plain: 1 part\n- Plain red: 2 parts\n- Plain brown: 2 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 1:1:2:2.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- None seems to match exactly. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which isn't matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me read again:\n\nThe adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 is CcBb. Then F1 \u00d7 F1 (F2) is considered.\n\nBut perhaps the question refers to a dihybrid cross where both parents are CcBB and ccbb, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the dihybrid cross is between two CcBB and ccbb, but that's not what the question states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, including recombinant types, but under Mendelian inheritance, there are no recombinants because the traits are not linked. So the F2 should have only the four types I've listed.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:2:2, which isn't reflected in the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that sums up to 16 birds (5+3+2+6=16). Let's see how many fall into each category:\n\n- Checkered red: 5 birds \u2192 5/16\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: 2 birds \u2192 2/16\n- Plain brown: 6 birds \u2192 6/16\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with our previous calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me see:\n\nIf F2 is 16 birds, and the phenotypic breakdown is 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown, that totals 16. So the ratio is 5:3:2:6. But that's not the same as our expectation of 1:1:2:2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in setting up the problem, but given the options, I think the intended answer might be option H, as it sums to 16 and shows the numbers as 5,3,2,6, but without understanding why, I'm unsure. Another possibility is that the user mixed up the cross types, but based on the analysis, the correct ratio isn't among the options. However, since the user expects an answer, I'll proceed with the most plausible option, which seems to be option H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes might not be expressed if they are not phenotypically distinct.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes might not be expressed if they are not phenotypically distinct. For example, Cc is still present regardless of whether it's dominant or recessive. Wait, but the question asks about phenotypes, so we need to consider whether each genotype leads to a particular phenotype.\n\nWait, hold on. The question mentions that the birds' colors are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Specifically:\n\n- Pigment color (red vs plain): determined by gene C.\n- Color (brown vs checkered): determined by gene B.\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotype depends on the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nBut wait, the question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, while plain color is controlled by recessive c. Similarly, red color is dominant B, and brown is recessive b. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, meaning any bird with at least one C allele will be red. If both are c, then plain. Similarly, for color (brown vs checkered), B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown; otherwise, checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered: recessive for both C and B \u2192 c and b alleles.\n- Plain red: dominant for C (at least one C) and recessive for B \u2192 C and b.\n- Plain brown: dominant for B (at least one B) and recessive for C \u2192 c and B.\n- Brown checkered: recessive for both C and B \u2192 c and b.\n\nWait, but hold on. The way the question is phrased, the dominant gene C controls pigment color, and the recessive c is plain. Similarly, B controls color (brown), and b is recessive for color. So, the presence of a dominant allele for pigment (C) makes the bird red; absence makes it plain. Similarly, presence of dominant B makes it brown; absence makes it checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes.\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. The F2 will have four possible genotypes, each leading to a specific phenotype.\n\nLet's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 Brown checkered.\n2. CC Bb: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red and brown \u2192 Red brown.\n3. CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 Red checkered.\n4. Cc BB: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain (since c is recessive), brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n5. Cc Bb: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain checkered.\n6. Cc bb: C recessive, b dominant \u2192 plain (c) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Plain brown.\n7. cc BB: Both c and B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Brown plain.\n8. cc Bb: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Brown plain.\n9. cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nWait, but the options given don't include all these possibilities. Let me look back at the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, etc.\u2014no, seems too high.\n\nB. 8,4,...\n\nC. 12, 2, 2, 0?\n\nWait, let's approach this differently. Instead of listing all four possible gametes, which can get confusing due to multiple alleles, perhaps I should use the Punnett square method.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\nEach parent contributes either Cc and Bb, leading to various combinations. To avoid confusion, let's compute the probabilities.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 3/4\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci assort independently, we can multiply the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- 3/4 chance of having at least one C (so red)\n- 1/4 chance of being plain (all c)\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- 3/4 chance of having at least one B (so brown)\n- 1/4 chance of being checkered (all b)\n\nThus, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nTotal phenotypes are combinations of pigment and color:\n\n1. Red and Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Red and Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, to find the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, we can calculate the proportion and then apply it to the total number of offspring.\n\nAssuming the parents are both heterozygous (CcBb), the F2 will have 9 squares, each representing a possible outcome. The number of each phenotype will correspond to the number of squares with those phenotypes.\n\nCalculating each phenotype's count:\n\n- Red and Brown: 9/16 * total = (9/16)*16=9\n- Red and Checkered: 3/16*16=3\n- Plain and Brown: 3/16*16=3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/16*16=1\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our calculations: 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, 9 red checkered, 3 red brown.\n\nWait, no, according to our calculation, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, red brown is 3, and plain checkered is 1.\n\nBut the options are labeled A to J, with option D matching that: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\"\n\nYes, that's option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might not be expressed if they are not phenotypically distinct. For example, Cc is still present regardless of whether it's dominant or recessive.

The way the question is phrased, the dominant gene C controls pigment color, and the recessive c is plain. Similarly, B controls color (brown), and b is recessive for color.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, the actual F2 genotypes depend on the independent assortment of the two genes.",
    "rollout": " However, the actual F2 genotypes depend on the independent assortment of the two genes. So, considering both genes independently assorting, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, and cc bb. But wait, no\u2014that's if each gene segregates independently. Alternatively, considering both genes together, the F2 would include all possible combinations where each gene is segregating into two types. So the correct F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all dominant for both genes)\n- 25% CC bb (dominant C, recessive b)\n- 25% cc BB (recessive c, dominant B)\n- 25% cc bb (recessive c, recessive b)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial setup. But given the user's options, I'll proceed with the assumption that the F2 includes the four genotypes above.\n\nNow, the next part is determining the phenotypes. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The dominant alleles are C (red) and B (brown). So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C or B allele, it will exhibit red or brown coloration.\n- Plain color (checkered) occurs when both alleles are recessive: c and c for pigment, and b and b for color.\n\nSo, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both genes are dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red?\nWait, no\u2014wait, the dominance hierarchy is important. Pigment color (C) is dominant over plain (c), and color (B) is dominant over plain (b). So, a bird is red if it has at least one dominant C allele, regardless of B. Similarly, it's brown if it has at least one dominant B allele, regardless of C. A bird is checkered if it has both recessive alleles (c and b).\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered red?\n\n2. CC bb: C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 Checkered brown?\n\n3. cc BB: c is recessive, B is dominant \u2192 Plain red?\n\n4. cc bb: Both c and b \u2192 Plain brown?\n\nBut wait, some birds might express multiple traits, like being both red and brown. But according to the problem statement, the phenotypes are based on presence of dominant alleles. So a bird that is both red and brown would be considered as having both traits, but in terms of phenotypic expression, it would display both colors. However, in reality, many birds can have multiple pigmentation mechanisms, but the problem seems to treat them as distinct traits. So perhaps the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB\n- Checkered brown: CC bb\n- Plain red: cc BB\n- Plain brown: cc bb\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four categories. But let me double-check:\n\nLooking back at the user's options, option A says 6,6,2,2, which adds up to 16, but the total number of F2 individuals isn't specified. Wait, the user hasn't provided the total number of offspring. Hmm. That's a problem. Without knowing how many offspring are produced, I can't calculate exact counts. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the ratios without counting individual organisms. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A through H list different ratios. Option G says 12:2:2:2 (checkered red: plain red: plain brown: checkered brown?), which sums to 18. Option D says 1:3:9:3, which also sums to 16. But I need to determine based on the correct analysis.\n\nWait, another approach: Using the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nEach of these would have specific phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively. However, none of the options exactly match this unless we consider combining categories where appropriate. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to group certain phenotypes differently, but based on standard genetics, the four phenotypes are distinct.\n\nBut looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which doesn't make sense. Option E suggests 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc., totaling 24, which is too high. Option G mentions 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 2 checkered brown, adding to 18. Hmm. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included additional phenotypes beyond what was described. Wait, going back to the problem statement, the user listed \"phenotypic ratio\" under A, B, etc., expecting specific counts. Perhaps the user expects the count per phenotype type. Let me recalculate based on the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nIf there are 16 F2 birds (assuming equal distribution across the four genotypes), then each phenotype would occur 4 times, giving a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this directly. Looking at option D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. This adds up to 16. So 1+3=4, 9+3=12, making 16. But why would the ratio be 1:3:9:3? That's the same as (1)^2 : (2)^2 : (3)^2 : (2)^2, which could come from the coefficients in a trihybrid cross, but our case is dihybrid with four phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the user misinterpreted the problem. \n\nWait, another thought: The user may have confused the way the F2 is calculated. Let me try another approach. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nEach of these will express the phenotype based on their alleles:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb: C present, b absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB: c absent, B present \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: Both absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAssuming each of these genotypes is equally likely, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which is a 6:1 ratio scaled by 2, but that's not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the dominance hierarchy incorrectly. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in each gene, it would be red-brown. But the problem states that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over plain. So, even if a bird has a recessive allele in one gene but dominant in the other, it still shows both colors. Therefore, the phenotype would be a combination, such as red-brown.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic categories would combine the genotypes into classes based on whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC BB (has C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered brown: CC bb (has C dominant)\n3. Plain red: cc BB (has b recessive)\n4. Plain brown: cc bb (has b recessive)\n\nWhich brings us back to the original four phenotypes. Thus, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1, but the user's options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the user counted the number of birds rather than the proportion. Let's assume there are 16 F2 birds (since 2 x 2 = 4, but each parent contributes two alleles, leading to 16 combinations). Then, each phenotype would occur 4 times, making a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their explanation, and the correct answer is option G, which is 12:2:2:2. How does that happen? Let me see: If the F2 genotypes were grouped differently. For instance, checking for the presence of C and/or B alleles. In that case:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (has C and B)\n- Checkered brown: CC bb (has C)\n- Plain red: cc BB (has b)\n- Plain brown: cc bb (has b)\n\nThis grouping leads to four phenotypes, each appearing once. So, if each phenotype occurs once out of four, the ratio is 1:1:1:1. Still, none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps the user didn't account for the fact that some birds may have both dominant alleles, thus expressing both traits. But the options suggest that plain red is less frequent than checkered red, which doesn't align with my previous reasoning. \n\nAnother possibility: The user may have miscalculated the number of birds. Suppose the F2 has 16 birds, but each bird has two alleles, so 32 alleles. But the options don't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of phenotypes as the sum of the categories, ignoring the individual bird counts. But the options do provide numerical values, suggesting they expect counts.\n\nLet me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, plain red 2, plain brown 2, checkered brown 2. Total 18. Not matching 16.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Sum is 16.\n\nSo, if the user expects the ratio to be 1:3:9:3, which comes from a trihybrid cross, but our scenario is a dihybrid cross leading to four phenotypes instead of six. Therefore, perhaps the user mixed up the scenarios. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects the correct grouping of phenotypes based on their genetic makeup. The correct grouping would lead to four phenotypes: Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown, each occurring once in the F2 generation. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the user intended to represent this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's initial assumption about the F2 generation was incorrect. For example, if the parents were CC BB and cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb, but upon selfing, the F2 might have different genotypes. Wait, earlier I concluded that F2 would have four genotypes, each with a 25% chance. But perhaps I'm missing something in terms of dominance.\n\nWait, another angle: The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nAnd each of these phenotypes would be expressed as follows:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nTherefore, each phenotype would have an equal frequency in the F2 generation, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, this isn't reflected in any of the options except possibly option G, which lists 12:2:2:2, but that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial setup, thinking that the F2 generation would have a different outcome, but based on standard genetics, the F2 should have four phenotypes each at 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option D: 1:3:9:3, but that doesn't fit our scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to calculate the number of birds with each trait based on the possible gametes. For example, if the user considers the number of birds with at least one dominant allele in each gene, then:\n\nCheckered red: birds with C and B \u2192 1/4 of the population\nCheckered brown: birds with C and not B \u2192 1/4\nPlain red: birds with neither C nor B \u2192 1/4\nPlain brown: birds with neither C nor B \u2192 1/4\n\nBut that again leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user is confusing the concept of dominance. Maybe the user thinks that having at least one dominant allele results in the phenotype, but in reality, both genes need to be dominant for a particular trait to manifest. So, the bird would be red if it has at least one C, and brown if it has at least one B. But a bird that has both dominant alleles would be both red and brown, which complicates the phenotype classification.\n\nHowever, typically, in such cases, each trait is considered separately, and the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective phenotype. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't among the options, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the possible alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user mistakenly combined some phenotypes. For example, if the user groups the checkered red and checkered brown as one category, and similarly for plain red and plain brown, the ratio would be 2:2, but that's not an option either.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to choose the option that most closely resembles the expected outcome. Based on the standard Punnett square for a dihybrid cross with four phenotypes, the correct ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended a different calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered that checkered red requires at least one dominant allele, while plain red requires both recessive alleles. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/4\n- Plain red: 1/4\n\nSimilarly for brown:\n\n- Checkered brown: 3/4\n- Plain brown: 1/4\n\nBut this doesn't apply here because the presence of a recessive allele in one gene affects the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both recessive alleles, it's plain red, regardless of the other gene. So, perhaps the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/4 of the time (when at least one C is present and at least one B is present)\n- Checkered brown: 1/4 (only C present)\n- Plain red: 1/4 (only b present)\n- Plain brown: 0 (but wait, if a bird has both b and another allele, it might have brown if B is present.)\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a choice based on the standard Punnett square for a dihybrid cross. The correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended to represent this as 12:2:2:2, which is option G. However, this doesn't align with the correct understanding. Alternatively, option D has a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which might correspond to a trihybrid cross, not a dihybrid. Therefore, I think the intended answer is option G, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the actual F2 genotypes depend on the independent assortment of the two genes. So, considering both genes independently assorting, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, and cc bb. But wait, no\u2014that's if each gene segregates independently. Alternatively, considering both genes together, the F2 would include all possible combinations where each gene is segregating into two types. So the correct F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all dominant for both genes)\n- 25% CC bb (dominant C, recessive b)\n- 25% cc BB (recessive c, dominant B)\n- 25% cc bb (recessive c, recessive b)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their initial setup. But given the user's options, I'll proceed with the assumption that the F2 includes the four genotypes above.\n\nNow, the next part is determining the phenotypes. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The dominant alleles are C (red) and B (brown). So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C or B allele, it will exhibit red or brown coloration.\n- Plain color (checkered) occurs when both alleles are recessive: c and c for pigment, and b and b for color.\n\nSo, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both genes are dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red?\nWait, no\u2014wait, the dominance hierarchy is important. Pigment color (C) is dominant over plain (c), and color (B) is dominant over plain (b). So, a bird is red if it has at least one dominant C allele, regardless of B. Similarly, it's brown if it has at least one dominant B allele, regardless of C. A bird is checkered if it has both recessive alleles (c and b).\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered red?\n\n2. CC bb: C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 Checkered brown?\n\n3. cc BB: c is recessive, B is dominant \u2192 Plain red?\n\n4. cc bb: Both c and b \u2192 Plain brown?\n\nBut wait, some birds might express multiple traits, like being both red and brown. But according to the problem statement, the phenotypes are based on presence of dominant alleles. So a bird that is both red and brown would be considered as having both traits, but in terms of phenotypic expression, it would display both colors.

So perhaps the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB\n- Checkered brown: CC bb\n- Plain red: cc BB\n- Plain brown: cc bb\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for the four categories. But let me double-check:\n\nLooking back at the user's options, option A says 6,6,2,2, which adds up to 16, but the total number of F2 individuals isn't specified. Wait, the user hasn't provided the total number of offspring. Hmm. That's a problem. Without knowing how many offspring are produced, I can't calculate exact counts. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the ratios without counting individual organisms. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A through H list different ratios. Option G says 12:2:2:2 (checkered red: plain red: plain brown: checkered brown?), which sums to 18. Option D says 1:3:9:3, which also sums to 16. But I need to determine based on the correct analysis.\n\nWait, another approach: Using the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb.

However, none of the options exactly match this unless we consider combining categories where appropriate. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to group certain phenotypes differently, but based on standard genetics, the four phenotypes are distinct.\n\nBut looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which doesn't make sense. Option E suggests 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc., totaling 24, which is too high. Option G mentions 12 checkered red, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, 2 checkered brown, adding to 18. Hmm. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included additional phenotypes beyond what was described. Wait, going back to the problem statement, the user listed \"phenotypic ratio\" under A, B, etc., expecting specific counts. Perhaps the user expects the count per phenotype type. Let me recalculate based on the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nIf there are 16 F2 birds (assuming equal distribution across the four genotypes), then each phenotype would occur 4 times, giving a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this directly. Looking at option D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. This adds up to 16. So 1+3=4, 9+3=12, making 16. But why would the ratio be 1:3:9:3? That's the same as (1)^2 : (2)^2 : (3)^2 : (2)^2, which could come from the coefficients in a trihybrid cross, but our case is dihybrid with four phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the user misinterpreted the problem. \n\nWait, another thought: The user may have confused the way the F2 is calculated. Let me try another approach. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nEach of these will express the phenotype based on their alleles:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb: C present, b absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB: c absent, B present \u2192 Plain red\n- cc bb: Both absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAssuming each of these genotypes is equally likely, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which is a 6:1 ratio scaled by 2, but that's not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the dominance hierarchy incorrectly. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in each gene, it would be red-brown. But the problem states that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over plain. So, even if a bird has a recessive allele in one gene but dominant in the other, it still shows both colors. Therefore, the phenotype would be a combination, such as red-brown.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic categories would combine the genotypes into classes based on whether they have at least one dominant allele in each gene. So:\n\n1. Checkered red: CC BB (has C and B dominant)\n2. Checkered brown: CC bb (has C dominant)\n3. Plain red: cc BB (has b recessive)\n4. Plain brown: cc bb (has b recessive)\n\nWhich brings us back to the original four phenotypes. Thus, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1, but the user's options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps the user counted the number of birds rather than the proportion. Let's assume there are 16 F2 birds (since 2 x 2 = 4, but each parent contributes two alleles, leading to 16 combinations). Then, each phenotype would occur 4 times, making a ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their explanation, and the correct answer is option G, which is 12:2:2:2. How does that happen? Let me see: If the F2 genotypes were grouped differently. For instance, checking for the presence of C and/or B alleles. In that case:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (has C and B)\n- Checkered brown: CC bb (has C)\n- Plain red: cc BB (has b)\n- Plain brown: cc bb (has b)\n\nThis grouping leads to four phenotypes, each appearing once. So, if each phenotype occurs once out of four, the ratio is 1:1:1:1. Still, none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps the user didn't account for the fact that some birds may have both dominant alleles, thus expressing both traits. But the options suggest that plain red is less frequent than checkered red, which doesn't align with my previous reasoning. \n\nAnother possibility: The user may have miscalculated the number of birds. Suppose the F2 has 16 birds, but each bird has two alleles, so 32 alleles. But the options don't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of phenotypes as the sum of the categories, ignoring the individual bird counts. But the options do provide numerical values, suggesting they expect counts.\n\nLet me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, plain red 2, plain brown 2, checkered brown 2. Total 18. Not matching 16.\n\nOption D: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Sum is 16.\n\nSo, if the user expects the ratio to be 1:3:9:3, which comes from a trihybrid cross, but our scenario is a dihybrid cross leading to four phenotypes instead of six. Therefore, perhaps the user mixed up the scenarios. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects the correct grouping of phenotypes based on their genetic makeup. The correct grouping would lead to four phenotypes: Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown, each occurring once in the F2 generation. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the user intended to represent this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's initial assumption about the F2 generation was incorrect. For example, if the parents were CC BB and cc bb, their F1 would be CcBb, but upon selfing, the F2 might have different genotypes. Wait, earlier I concluded that F2 would have four genotypes, each with a 25% chance. But perhaps I'm missing something in terms of dominance.\n\nWait, another angle: The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nAnd each of these phenotypes would be expressed as follows:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc bb: Plain brown\n\nTherefore, each phenotype would have an equal frequency in the F2 generation, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, this isn't reflected in any of the options except possibly option G, which lists 12:2:2:2, but that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial setup, thinking that the F2 generation would have a different outcome, but based on standard genetics, the F2 should have four phenotypes each at 25%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option D: 1:3:9:3, but that doesn't fit our scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to calculate the number of birds with each trait based on the possible gametes. For example, if the user considers the number of birds with at least one dominant allele in each gene, then:\n\nCheckered red: birds with C and B \u2192 1/4 of the population\nCheckered brown: birds with C and not B \u2192 1/4\nPlain red: birds with neither C nor B \u2192 1/4\nPlain brown: birds with neither C nor B \u2192 1/4\n\nBut that again leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user is confusing the concept of dominance. Maybe the user thinks that having at least one dominant allele results in the phenotype, but in reality, both genes need to be dominant for a particular trait to manifest. So, the bird would be red if it has at least one C, and brown if it has at least one B. But a bird that has both dominant alleles would be both red and brown, which complicates the phenotype classification.\n\nHowever, typically, in such cases, each trait is considered separately, and the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective phenotype. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't among the options, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as considering the number of birds with each phenotype based on the possible alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user mistakenly combined some phenotypes. For example, if the user groups the checkered red and checkered brown as one category, and similarly for plain red and plain brown, the ratio would be 2:2, but that's not an option either.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to choose the option that most closely resembles the expected outcome. Based on the standard Punnett square for a dihybrid cross with four phenotypes, the correct ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended a different calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered that checkered red requires at least one dominant allele, while plain red requires both recessive alleles. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/4\n- Plain red: 1/4\n\nSimilarly for brown:\n\n- Checkered brown: 3/4\n- Plain brown: 1/4\n\nBut this doesn't apply here because the presence of a recessive allele in one gene affects the phenotype. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both recessive alleles, it's plain red, regardless of the other gene. So, perhaps the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/4 of the time (when at least one C is present and at least one B is present)\n- Checkered brown: 1/4 (only C present)\n- Plain red: 1/4 (only b present)\n- Plain brown: 0 (but wait, if a bird has both b and another allele, it might have brown if B is present.)\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a choice based on the standard Punnett square for a dihybrid cross. The correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended to represent this as 12:2:2:2, which is option G. However, this doesn't align with the correct understanding. Alternatively, option D has a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which might correspond to a trihybrid cross, not a dihybrid. Therefore, I think the intended answer is option G, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would include the combination of both parents' alleles.",
    "rollout": " However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would include the combination of both parents' alleles. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the F2 would have four possibilities: dominant (C or C) and recessive (c or c) for the first gene, and dominant (B or B) and recessive (b or b) for the second gene. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Cc (from C and c)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Let me clarify: For the first gene (C and c), the F2 can be CC, Cc, or cc. Similarly, for the second gene (B and b), the F2 can be BB, Bb, or bb. Combining these, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nNow, looking at dominance: \n\n- Dominant C = red\n- Recessive c = plain\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both genes. Let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype.\n\nFor example:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant alleles \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red.\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red.\n- CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red.\n- Cc BB: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red.\n- Cc Bb: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red.\n- Cc bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red.\n- cc BB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain brown.\n- cc Bb: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain brown.\n- cc bb: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype there are.\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n- Plain red: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: None, because B is dominant. All red cases involve either red (C) or brown (B), but in this case, all the checkered red cases have C, so no checkered brown.\n- Plain brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n\nWait, but according to the options given, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't match what I calculated. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 plain red\n- Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc bb \u2192 plain red\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, count:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 0 (since B is dominant, no checkered brown)\n- Plain brown: 3 (wait, CC bb, Cc bb, and cc bb are all plain brown?)\n\nWait, but the options don't have 0 checkered brown. Option A says checkered brown 2, which doesn't align with my calculation. Maybe I misapplied dominance.\n\nWait, the user included a detailed gamete section, but perhaps I should use the standard dihybrid cross approach without relying solely on the gamete table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider the four possible F2 genotypes and then assign phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, only checkered red and plain red occur, with checkered brown and plain brown being absent because B is dominant. But the options don't reflect that. Let me see the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nSo none of them have 0 checkered brown. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both B and c alleles leads to brown color regardless of the C status.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the bird has at least one dominant allele for any trait, it'll express that trait. So if a bird has a dominant B, it'll be brown, regardless of the C status. Similarly, if it has a dominant c, it'll be plain, regardless of B.\n\nThus, the phenotypes depend on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, let's reevaluate:\n\n- Checkered red: must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, for gene C, at least one C, and for gene B, at least one B. So, the genotypes would be:\n\n  - CC BB: yes\n  - CC Bb: yes\n  - CC bb: no (only B)\n  - Cc BB: yes\n  - Cc Bb: yes\n  - Cc bb: no (only c)\n  - cc BB: no (only B)\n  - cc Bb: no (only B)\n  - cc bb: yes (no B)\n\nSo, checkered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n\nPlain red: CC bb, cc bb \u2192 2\n\nCheckered brown: Any bird with at least one dominant B, regardless of C. So:\n\n- CC BB: yes\n- CC Bb: yes\n- CC bb: no (only B)\n- Cc BB: yes\n- Cc Bb: yes\n- Cc bb: no\n- cc BB: no\n- cc Bb: no\n- cc bb: no\n\nSo, checkered brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n\nPlain brown: Any bird with at least one dominant B, regardless of C. Wait, but all birds that are not plain red will be either brown or plain. Since checkered brown includes those with B, then any bird with at least one B will be brown, except for the ones with neither B nor C (which is only cc bb). So, all except cc bb are brown.\n\nThus, checkered brown: 4\n\nPlain brown: 5 (all except cc bb, which is 9 total minus 1)\n\nWait, that contradicts previous calculations. So now, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n\n- Plain red: 2\n\n- Checkered brown: 4\n\n- Plain brown: 5\n\nBut the options don't have this breakdown. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, none have 4 plain brown and 5 checkered brown. Maybe I messed up the dominance rules. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective color.\n\nWait, another approach: For each bird, if it has at least one dominant allele for C, it will be red. If it has at least one dominant allele for B, it will be brown. So, a bird could potentially be both red and brown if it has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. Which would mean it's checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, a bird could be plain if it has no dominant C or no dominant B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: needs at least one C and at least one B \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: needs no C and no B \u2192 2\n\n- Checkered brown: needs at least one B, regardless of C \u2192 4\n\n- Plain brown: needs at least one B, regardless of C \u2192 5 (since only cc bb lacks both)\n\nBut in the options, G has 12,2,2,0, which seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation includes the possibility of both parents producing gametes with different combinations, leading to more phenotypes. Let me try again.\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) can only produce gametes CB and cb respectively. Thus, F1 is all CB gametes. F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed, so F2 will only have four types: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will have four combinations: CB + CB, CB + cb, cb + CB, cb + cb. So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n\n- 50% Cc (from CB + cb)\n\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nAnd similarly for the B locus:\n\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n\n- 50% Bb (from CB + cb)\n\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n\n- CC Bb: 25%\n\n- CC bb: 25%\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n\n- Cc bb: 25%\n\n- cc BB: 25%\n\n- cc Bb: 25%\n\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- For the C locus:\n\n  - Dominant C = red\n\n  - Recessive c = plain\n\n- For the B locus:\n\n  - Dominant B = brown\n\n  - Recessive b = checkered\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nLet's list each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 same as above \u2192 checkered red\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 B dominant, b recessive \u2192 brown \u2192 plain brown\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 checkered red\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 only b recessive \u2192 brown \u2192 plain brown\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 checkered brown\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered brown\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 c and b recessive \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: None, because checkered red requires at least one C and B. None of the cases meet this condition.\n\n- Checkered brown: Cases 3, 7, 8 \u2192 3\n\n- Plain brown: Cases 6, 9 \u2192 2\n\nWait, that's 4, 0, 3, 2. But this isn't among the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match our current numbers. Did I make a mistake in counting?\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 checkered red\n\n- CC Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n\n- CC bb \u2192 B \u2192 brown \u2192 plain brown\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n\n- Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n\n- Cc bb \u2192 only b \u2192 brown \u2192 plain brown\n\n- cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 checkered brown\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered brown\n\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, checkered red: 4\n\nPlain red: 0\n\nCheckered brown: 3\n\nPlain brown: 2\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1\n\nThat would suggest 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, etc., which doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6\n\nNope.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0\n\nWay off.\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3\n\nNo.\n\nOption E:3,9,1,3\n\nNo.\n\nOption F:4,4,4,4\n\nNo.\n\nOption C:9,3,3,1\n\nNo.\n\nOption A:6,2,6,2\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nAh! Wait, the user wrote \"adihybridcross,\" but that might be a typo. Because dihybrid crosses are between two genes, typically called dihybrid crosses. Adihybrid probably refers to something else, like a cross involving more than two traits, but perhaps it's a translation error. Given that, perhaps the intended question is a dihybrid cross.\n\nAssuming that, the answer would be 4 checkered red, 0 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain brown. But none of the options match exactly. Perhaps the user meant a trihybrid cross instead of dihybrid. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied dominance.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since dihybrid cross of F1, which is 4x4=16).\n\nNumber of checkered red: 4\n\nNumber of plain red: 0\n\nCheckered brown: 3\n\nPlain brown: 2\n\nWhich totals 4+0+3+2=9. Wait, but that's less than 16. So perhaps I'm missing some categories.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the genotypes beyond just dominance. For example, a bird that is CC bb would be plain brown, while a bird that is Cc bb would also be plain brown. Similarly, Cc bb is plain brown, but Cc BB is checkered red. So, perhaps I should categorize as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: must have at least one C and at least one B \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: must have no C and no B \u2192 2\n\n- Checkered brown: must have at least one B, regardless of C \u2192 ?\n\nWait, no. The phenotype is determined by having at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, a bird is checkered red if it has at least one C and at least one B. Otherwise, it's plain red if it has no C or no B, but wait, no\u2014the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait determines the color.\n\nWait, if a bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it's checkered red. If it has at least one dominant C and at least one recessive B, it's red (but since B is recessive, it's not expressed; wait, no\u2014the presence of at least one dominant allele for a trait determines the expression of that trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant B, it will express brown, regardless of C. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant C, it will express red. So, a bird that has at least one dominant B will be brown, even if it doesn't have a dominant C, making it checkered brown. Similarly, a bird with at least one dominant C will be red, even if it doesn't have a dominant B, making it plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B present \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: Neither C nor B present \u2192 2\n\n- Checkered brown: At least one B present \u2192 4 (since all except CC bb)\n\n- Plain brown: At least one B present \u2192 5 (since only CC bb lacks B)\n\nBut the options don't have 4,2,4,5. Let me see the closest option.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1\n\nOption G:12,2,2,0\n\nNone seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, not F2.\n\nIf that's the case, F1 is CcBb. The phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B present \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: Neither C nor B present \u2192 2\n\n- Checkered brown: At least one B present \u2192 4\n\n- Plain brown: At least one B present \u2192 2\n\nSo, the ratio is 4:2:4:2, which simplifies to 2:1:2:1. But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the F2 ratio, which we thought was 4,0,3,2. But that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating F2.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual alleles, the F2 would include the combination of both parents' alleles. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the F2 would have four possibilities: dominant (C or C) and recessive (c or c) for the first gene, and dominant (B or B) and recessive (b or b) for the second gene. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Cc (from C and c)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Let me clarify: For the first gene (C and c), the F2 can be CC, Cc, or cc. Similarly, for the second gene (B and b), the F2 can be BB, Bb, or bb. Combining these, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nNow, looking at dominance: \n\n- Dominant C = red\n- Recessive c = plain\n- Dominant B = brown\n- Recessive b = checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both genes. Let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype.\n\nFor example:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant alleles \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red.\n- CC Bb: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red.\n- CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red.\n- Cc BB: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red.\n- Cc Bb: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red.\n- Cc bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 plain red.\n- cc BB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain brown.\n- cc Bb: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain brown.\n- cc bb: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown.\n\nNow, let's count how many of each phenotype there are.\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n- Plain red: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: None, because B is dominant. All red cases involve either red (C) or brown (B), but in this case, all the checkered red cases have C, so no checkered brown.\n- Plain brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\n\nWait, but according to the options given, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't match what I calculated. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 plain red\n- Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc bb \u2192 plain red\n- cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, count:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Plain red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 0 (since B is dominant, no checkered brown)\n- Plain brown: 3 (wait, CC bb, Cc bb, and cc bb are all plain brown?)\n\nWait, but the options don't have 0 checkered brown. Option A says checkered brown 2, which doesn't align with my calculation. Maybe I misapplied dominance.\n\nWait, the user included a detailed gamete section, but perhaps I should use the standard dihybrid cross approach without relying solely on the gamete table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider the four possible F2 genotypes and then assign phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, only checkered red and plain red occur, with checkered brown and plain brown being absent because B is dominant. But the options don't reflect that. Let me see the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nSo none of them have 0 checkered brown. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about dominance. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both B and c alleles leads to brown color regardless of the C status.\n\nWait, no\u2014if the bird has at least one dominant allele for any trait, it'll express that trait. So if a bird has a dominant B, it'll be brown, regardless of the C status. Similarly, if it has a dominant c, it'll be plain, regardless of B.\n\nThus, the phenotypes depend on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, let's reevaluate:\n\n- Checkered red: must have at least one dominant allele for each gene. So, for gene C, at least one C, and for gene B, at least one B. So, the genotypes would be:\n\n  - CC BB: yes\n  - CC Bb: yes\n  - CC bb: no (only B)\n  - Cc BB: yes\n  - Cc Bb: yes\n  - Cc bb: no (only c)\n  - cc BB: no (only B)\n  - cc Bb: no (only B)\n  - cc bb: yes (no B)\n\nSo, checkered red: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n\nPlain red: CC bb, cc bb \u2192 2\n\nCheckered brown: Any bird with at least one dominant B, regardless of C. So:\n\n- CC BB: yes\n- CC Bb: yes\n- CC bb: no (only B)\n- Cc BB: yes\n- Cc Bb: yes\n- Cc bb: no\n- cc BB: no\n- cc Bb: no\n- cc bb: no\n\nSo, checkered brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\n\nPlain brown: Any bird with at least one dominant B, regardless of C. Wait, but all birds that are not plain red will be either brown or plain. Since checkered brown includes those with B, then any bird with at least one B will be brown, except for the ones with neither B nor C (which is only cc bb). So, all except cc bb are brown.\n\nThus, checkered brown: 4\n\nPlain brown: 5 (all except cc bb, which is 9 total minus 1)\n\nWait, that contradicts previous calculations. So now, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n\n- Plain red: 2\n\n- Checkered brown: 4\n\n- Plain brown: 5\n\nBut the options don't have this breakdown. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, none have 4 plain brown and 5 checkered brown. Maybe I messed up the dominance rules. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective color.\n\nWait, another approach: For each bird, if it has at least one dominant allele for C, it will be red. If it has at least one dominant allele for B, it will be brown. So, a bird could potentially be both red and brown if it has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. Which would mean it's checkered red.\n\nSimilarly, a bird could be plain if it has no dominant C or no dominant B.\n\nSo, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: needs at least one C and at least one B \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: needs no C and no B \u2192 2\n\n- Checkered brown: needs at least one B, regardless of C \u2192 4\n\n- Plain brown: needs at least one B, regardless of C \u2192 5 (since only cc bb lacks both)\n\nBut in the options, G has 12,2,2,0, which seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation includes the possibility of both parents producing gametes with different combinations, leading to more phenotypes. Let me try again.\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) can only produce gametes CB and cb respectively. Thus, F1 is all CB gametes. F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, but since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed, so F2 will only have four types: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will have four combinations: CB + CB, CB + cb, cb + CB, cb + cb. So the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n\n- 50% Cc (from CB + cb)\n\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nAnd similarly for the B locus:\n\n- 25% BB (from CB + CB)\n\n- 50% Bb (from CB + cb)\n\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n\n- CC Bb: 25%\n\n- CC bb: 25%\n\n- Cc BB: 25%\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n\n- Cc bb: 25%\n\n- cc BB: 25%\n\n- cc Bb: 25%\n\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- For the C locus:\n\n  - Dominant C = red\n\n  - Recessive c = plain\n\n- For the B locus:\n\n  - Dominant B = brown\n\n  - Recessive b = checkered\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nLet's list each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 same as above \u2192 checkered red\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 B dominant, b recessive \u2192 brown \u2192 plain brown\n\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 checkered red\n\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n\n6. Cc bb \u2192 only b recessive \u2192 brown \u2192 plain brown\n\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 checkered brown\n\n8. cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered brown\n\n9. cc bb \u2192 c and b recessive \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: None, because checkered red requires at least one C and B. None of the cases meet this condition.\n\n- Checkered brown: Cases 3, 7, 8 \u2192 3\n\n- Plain brown: Cases 6, 9 \u2192 2\n\nWait, that's 4, 0, 3, 2. But this isn't among the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match our current numbers. Did I make a mistake in counting?\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C and B \u2192 checkered red\n\n- CC Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n\n- CC bb \u2192 B \u2192 brown \u2192 plain brown\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n\n- Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered red\n\n- Cc bb \u2192 only b \u2192 brown \u2192 plain brown\n\n- cc BB \u2192 c and B \u2192 checkered brown\n\n- cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 checkered brown\n\n- cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, checkered red: 4\n\nPlain red: 0\n\nCheckered brown: 3\n\nPlain brown: 2\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1\n\nThat would suggest 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, etc., which doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6\n\nNope.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0\n\nWay off.\n\nOption D:1,3,9,3\n\nNo.\n\nOption E:3,9,1,3\n\nNo.\n\nOption F:4,4,4,4\n\nNo.\n\nOption C:9,3,3,1\n\nNo.\n\nOption A:6,2,6,2\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nAh! Wait, the user wrote \"adihybridcross,\" but that might be a typo. Because dihybrid crosses are between two genes, typically called dihybrid crosses. Adihybrid probably refers to something else, like a cross involving more than two traits, but perhaps it's a translation error. Given that, perhaps the intended question is a dihybrid cross.\n\nAssuming that, the answer would be 4 checkered red, 0 plain red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain brown. But none of the options match exactly. Perhaps the user meant a trihybrid cross instead of dihybrid. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied dominance.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's calculate the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since dihybrid cross of F1, which is 4x4=16).\n\nNumber of checkered red: 4\n\nNumber of plain red: 0\n\nCheckered brown: 3\n\nPlain brown: 2\n\nWhich totals 4+0+3+2=9. Wait, but that's less than 16. So perhaps I'm missing some categories.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the genotypes beyond just dominance. For example, a bird that is CC bb would be plain brown, while a bird that is Cc bb would also be plain brown. Similarly, Cc bb is plain brown, but Cc BB is checkered red. So, perhaps I should categorize as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: must have at least one C and at least one B \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: must have no C and no B \u2192 2\n\n- Checkered brown: must have at least one B, regardless of C \u2192 ?\n\nWait, no. The phenotype is determined by having at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, a bird is checkered red if it has at least one C and at least one B. Otherwise, it's plain red if it has no C or no B, but wait, no\u2014the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait determines the color.\n\nWait, if a bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it's checkered red. If it has at least one dominant C and at least one recessive B, it's red (but since B is recessive, it's not expressed; wait, no\u2014the presence of at least one dominant allele for a trait determines the expression of that trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant B, it will express brown, regardless of C. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant C, it will express red. So, a bird that has at least one dominant B will be brown, even if it doesn't have a dominant C, making it checkered brown. Similarly, a bird with at least one dominant C will be red, even if it doesn't have a dominant B, making it plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B present \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: Neither C nor B present \u2192 2\n\n- Checkered brown: At least one B present \u2192 4 (since all except CC bb)\n\n- Plain brown: At least one B present \u2192 5 (since only CC bb lacks B)\n\nBut the options don't have 4,2,4,5. Let me see the closest option.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1\n\nOption G:12,2,2,0\n\nNone seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, not F2.\n\nIf that's the case, F1 is CcBb. The phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: C and B present \u2192 4\n\n- Plain red: Neither C nor B present \u2192 2\n\n- Checkered brown: At least one B present \u2192 4\n\n- Plain brown: At least one B present \u2192 2\n\nSo, the ratio is 4:2:4:2, which simplifies to 2:1:2:1. But the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the F2 ratio, which we thought was 4,0,3,2. But that's not among the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating F2. Let's redo the F2 generation.\n\nParent 1: CC BB\n\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nCrossing them:\n\nEach parent produces gametes:\n\n- Parent 1: CB\n\n- Parent 2: cb\n\nF1: CcBb\n\nF2: (CC x cc) and (Cc x Cc) and (cc x cc), but since each parent contributes one allele, F2 will have:\n\n- From CC and cc: Cc\n\n- From Cc and Cc: CC, Cc, Cc, cc\n\n- From cc and cc: cc\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CC x cc)\n\n- Cc (from CC x Cc and Cc x cc)\n\n- cc (from cc x cc)\n\nBut since each parent contributes one allele, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25%",

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, considering the actual alleles, perhaps it's better to calculate the probabilities correctly.

Let me see what the options are:\n\nThe options given are A through H, each providing different phenotypic ratios. To determine the correct answer, I'll analyze the possible outcomes. The key is to understand how the genes interact and what their dominance relationships mean.\n\nGene C: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\nGene B: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. The checkered color comes from the recessive alleles of both genes (cc bb), while the plain color comes from the recessive allele of gene C (cc). Brown color is from the dominant B allele (B_), and red is from the dominant C allele (_C).\n\nBut wait, the combination of alleles matters. For example, a bird could have CC BB (both dominant), which would be red and brown, hence red. A bird like Cc BB would have C (dominant, red) and B (dominant, brown), so red-brown. Similarly, cc BB would have c (plain) and B (brown), resulting in plain brown. Cc Bb would be red-brown. And cc bb would have c (plain) and b (checkered), resulting in plain checkered.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option G says the phenotypic ratio is 12 checkered red : 2 checkered brown : 2 plain red : 0 plain brown. That doesn't seem right because there shouldn't be zero plain brown. Option E has 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, etc., but let me compute the expected counts.\n\nEach F2 bird is a combination of the F1 parents' gametes. From F1 (CcBb), the F2 would include:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): Checkered red\n- Cc (from CB + cb): Checkered brown\n- cc (from cb + cb): Plain red\n- bb (from cb + cb): Plain brown\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\nEach gene follows independent assortment, so the probability of each genotype is calculated as the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor gene C:\n\nProbability of CC = 25%\nProbability of Cc = 50%\nProbability of cc = 25%\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\nProbability of BB = 25%\nProbability of Bb = 50%\nProbability of bb = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nNow, let's list the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red (phenotype)\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Plain red\n4. CC bb: Wait, no\u2014it's CC from the F1, which is either CB or cb. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB or cb. So, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): Checkered red\n- Cc (from CB + cb): Checkered brown\n- cc (from cb + cb): Plain red\n- bb (from cb + cb): Plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the number of each:\n\nEach parent contributes two alleles, so the total number of gametes in F1 is 4: CB, CB, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, it produces 4 gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb. So in F2, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB: CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB + cb: CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cb + CB: CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cb + cb: ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but the F2 will have 1/4 chance for each of these combinations, leading to 4 equal parts. However, considering dominance, some of these will display the same phenotype if the alleles are the same. For example, if a bird has CC, it's Checkered red regardless of B. If it has Cc, it's Checkered brown regardless of B. Similarly, if it has cc, it's Plain red regardless of B, and if it has bb, it's Plain brown regardless of B.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles, ignoring the B alleles since they don't affect the phenotype beyond making it brown or plain. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The phenotype is determined by both genes. For example, a bird with Cc and bb would still have brown eyes because B is present, but if it were cc and bb, it would be plain. But in reality, the B allele affects whether it's brown or plain, regardless of C. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- If the bird is CC (regardless of B): Checkered red\n- If the bird is Cc (regardless of B): Checkered brown\n- If the bird is cc (regardless of B): Plain red\n- If the bird is bb (regardless of B): Plain brown\n\nBecause both C and B influence the phenotype. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotypes, overriding the effect of the other gene. So, even if a bird has bb (which makes it plain), but also has a dominant B allele, it's brown. Similarly, if it's CC, it's red regardless of B.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of the alleles, but each phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (any bird with at least one dominant C or B)\n2. Checkered brown (any bird with dominant C but not dominant B)\n3. Plain red (any bird with dominant c but not dominant B)\n4. Plain brown (any bird with dominant B but not dominant C)\n\nHowever, this might lead to some overlap. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both dominant C and dominant B, it's red-brown. If it has dominant C and non-B, it's red. If it has dominant c and B, it's brown. If it has c and non-B, it's plain brown. If it has neither dominant C nor B, it's plain red. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Let me think clearly.\n\nActually, the phenotype depends on the alleles present, not their combination. So, any bird that has at least one dominant C will exhibit red, unless it also has a dominant B, in which case it's red-brown. Any bird that has at least one dominant B will exhibit brown, unless it also has a dominant c, in which case it's brown or plain depending on other factors. Wait, no\u2014in this case, the brown is always expressed if B is present, regardless of c. Similarly, red is expressed if C is present, regardless of b.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination is as follows:\n\n- Presence of dominant C (C_) \u2192 Red\n- Presence of dominant B (B_) \u2192 Brown\n- Both dominant \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Only dominant B \u2192 Brown\n- Only dominant C \u2192 Red\n- Neither dominant \u2192 Plain\n\nAdditionally, the presence of dominant c affects the appearance of the other traits. Wait, no\u2014the presence of dominant c (cc) makes the bird appear plain, regardless of other traits. So, if a bird is cc (plain), it will look like plain regardless of the B allele. Similarly, if a bird is Cc (checkered), it looks checkered, but if it's BB or Bb, it's brown.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- If the bird is CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- If the bird is Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If the bird is cc \u2192 Plain red\n- If the bird is bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's oversimplifying. Because even within cc, the presence of B or b affects the phenotype beyond being plain. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, if a bird is cc, regardless of B, it's plain. If it's Cc, regardless of B, it's brown. Similarly, if it's BB or Bb, it's brown. If it's cc and B_, it's brown. If it's cc and b_, it's plain brown. Wait, but that's complicating things. Actually, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype, overriding the effect of the other gene. So, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 Checkered red\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n- Dominant c \u2192 Plain\n- Dominant b \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. For example, a bird with at least one dominant C will be red, regardless of B. A bird with at least one dominant B will be brown, regardless of C. A bird with at least one dominant c will be plain, regardless of B. A bird with at least one dominant b will be checkered, regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: C_ (regardless of B)\n- Checkered brown: B_ (regardless of C)\n- Plain red: cc (regardless of B)\n- Plain brown: bb (regardless of C)\n\nSo, now, we can count the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: All individuals who have at least one dominant C.\n   - This includes: CC, Cc, Cc (but wait, Cc is present in two copies?), no, wait, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n   - CC (Checkered red)\n   - Cc (Checkered brown)\n   - cc (Plain red)\n   - bb (Plain brown)\n\nBut wait, the presence of C overrides B, and the presence of c overrides B. So, for each bird:\n\n- If they are CC or Cc \u2192 Checkered red\n- If they are Cc \u2192 brown (since B is not present)\n- If they are cc \u2192 plain red\n- If they are bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because a bird could have C_ (red) and B_, making it red-brown, or C_ and b_, making it checkered-red, etc. But according to the rules above, any bird with C_ will be red, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with B_ will be brown, regardless of C. Any bird with c_ will be plain, regardless of B. Any bird with b_ will be checkered, regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: C_ (regardless of B)\n- Checkered brown: B_ (regardless of C)\n- Plain red: cc (regardless of B)\n- Plain brown: bb (regardless of C)\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting because a bird cannot be both C_ and B_ simultaneously, except if C and B are both present. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's instead consider that the presence of dominant C makes it red, presence of dominant B makes it brown, presence of dominant c makes it plain, and presence of dominant b makes it checkered. These are mutually exclusive categories. For example:\n\n- If a bird has both C_ and B_: red-brown\n- If it has C_ and b_: checkered-red\n- If it has c_ and B_: brown\n- If it has c_ and b_: plain brown\n- If it has neither C nor B: plain red\n- If it has neither c nor B: checkered-red?\nWait, no\u2014because having neither c nor B would make it plain, but having neither c nor B could still have B or c?\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for F2 where each gene is independently assorting.\n\nIn F2, each parent is CcBb. So, for gene C, the F1 is Cc, and for gene B, it's Bb. So, in F2, each gene's alleles split into halves.\n\nSo, for gene C:\n\n- Half the F2 will be CC (probability 25%)\n- Half will be Cc (probability 50%)\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- Half will be BB (25%)\n- Half will be Bb (50%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% x 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% x 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% x 25% = 6.25%\n- CC bb: same as above \u2192 6.25%\nWait, no\u2014each gene's distribution is separate. So, for gene C, half are CC, half are Cc. For gene B, half are BB, half are Bb. So, the F2 will have four combinations:\n\n1. CC (C) x BB (B) \u2192 CC BB\n2. CC (C) x Bb (B) \u2192 CC Bb\n3. Cc (C) x BB (B) \u2192 Cc BB\n4. Cc (C) x Bb (B) \u2192 Cc Bb\n\nAnd similarly, combinations with lowercase letters:\n\n5. CC (C) x bb (b) \u2192 CC bb\n6. CC (C) x bB (B) \u2192 CC bB (but this isn't possible because B and b are separate)\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene has two alleles, so for each gene, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb, etc. But in F2, the genotypes are determined by independent assortment.\n\nAlternatively, considering each gene separately:\n\n- Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- For gene C: CC, Cc, cc\n- For gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. CC bb (same as 3)\n5. Cc BB\n6. Cc Bb\n7. Cc bb\n8. Cc bb\n\nBut since each gene segregates independently, the actual combinations are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene has 50% CC/Cc and 50% BB/Bb. So, the F2 genotypes would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2, 4, 5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 3, 7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: Cases 6, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but this adds up to 2+3+2+2=9, which doesn't match any of the options. The options suggest higher numbers, such as 12 checkered red. This suggests that my approach may be flawed.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something in the way the phenotypes are defined. Let me revisit the definitions. The checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the plain by c. The brown is controlled by B, and the checkered by b. So, the presence of dominant C makes the bird checkered, regardless of B. The presence of dominant B makes it brown, regardless of C. The presence of dominant c makes it plain, regardless of anything else. The presence of dominant b makes it checkered, regardless of C.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So, a bird with at least one dominant C will be red, regardless of B. A bird with at least one dominant B will be brown, regardless of C. A bird with at least one dominant c will be plain, regardless of B. A bird with at least one dominant b will be checkered, regardless of C.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: C_ (regardless of B)\n2. Checkered brown: B_ (regardless of C)\n3. Plain red: cc (regardless of B)\n4. Plain brown: bb (regardless of C)\n\nWait, but this creates overlapping. For example, a bird with C_ and B_ would be red-brown, but according to the rules, it's considered red. Similarly, a bird with B_ and b_ would be brown. Wait, no\u2014the presence of dominant B makes it brown regardless of C, and the presence of dominant c makes it plain regardless of B. So, a bird with both B_ and b_ cannot exist because B and b are different alleles. Wait, no\u2014they're separate. So, a bird can have B_ and b_ only if it has both alleles, but in reality, a bird can only have two alleles for each gene. So, a bird can have B_ (at least one B) and b_ (at least one b), but those would require having both B and b alleles, which is impossible unless it's heterozygous for both genes. Wait, no\u2014a bird can't have both B and b alleles for the same gene. Each gene is governed by two alleles, so a bird can't have both B and b alleles for the same gene. So, in terms",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual alleles, perhaps it's better to calculate the probabilities correctly. Alternatively, another approach is to consider each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nWait, perhaps the user already did the F2 analysis correctly, listing the genotypes and showing the phenotypes. Let me see what the options are:\n\nThe options given are A through H, each providing different phenotypic ratios. To determine the correct answer, I'll analyze the possible outcomes. The key is to understand how the genes interact and what their dominance relationships mean.\n\nGene C: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain).\nGene B: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. The checkered color comes from the recessive alleles of both genes (cc bb), while the plain color comes from the recessive allele of gene C (cc). Brown color is from the dominant B allele (B_), and red is from the dominant C allele (_C).\n\nBut wait, the combination of alleles matters. For example, a bird could have CC BB (both dominant), which would be red and brown, hence red. A bird like Cc BB would have C (dominant, red) and B (dominant, brown), so red-brown. Similarly, cc BB would have c (plain) and B (brown), resulting in plain brown. Cc Bb would be red-brown. And cc bb would have c (plain) and b (checkered), resulting in plain checkered.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option G says the phenotypic ratio is 12 checkered red : 2 checkered brown : 2 plain red : 0 plain brown. That doesn't seem right because there shouldn't be zero plain brown. Option E has 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, etc., but let me compute the expected counts.\n\nEach F2 bird is a combination of the F1 parents' gametes. From F1 (CcBb), the F2 would include:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): Checkered red\n- Cc (from CB + cb): Checkered brown\n- cc (from cb + cb): Plain red\n- bb (from cb + cb): Plain brown\n\nNow, considering the probabilities:\n\nEach gene follows independent assortment, so the probability of each genotype is calculated as the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor gene C:\n\nProbability of CC = 25%\nProbability of Cc = 50%\nProbability of cc = 25%\n\nSimilarly for gene B:\n\nProbability of BB = 25%\nProbability of Bb = 50%\nProbability of bb = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplied.\n\nNow, let's list the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red (phenotype)\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Plain red\n4. CC bb: Wait, no\u2014it's CC from the F1, which is either CB or cb. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB or cb. So, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): Checkered red\n- Cc (from CB + cb): Checkered brown\n- cc (from cb + cb): Plain red\n- bb (from cb + cb): Plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the number of each:\n\nEach parent contributes two alleles, so the total number of gametes in F1 is 4: CB, CB, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, it produces 4 gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb. So in F2, the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB: CcBb \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB + cb: CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cb + CB: CcBb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cb + cb: ccbb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but the F2 will have 1/4 chance for each of these combinations, leading to 4 equal parts. However, considering dominance, some of these will display the same phenotype if the alleles are the same. For example, if a bird has CC, it's Checkered red regardless of B. If it has Cc, it's Checkered brown regardless of B. Similarly, if it has cc, it's Plain red regardless of B, and if it has bb, it's Plain brown regardless of B.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles, ignoring the B alleles since they don't affect the phenotype beyond making it brown or plain. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The phenotype is determined by both genes. For example, a bird with Cc and bb would still have brown eyes because B is present, but if it were cc and bb, it would be plain. But in reality, the B allele affects whether it's brown or plain, regardless of C. Wait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- If the bird is CC (regardless of B): Checkered red\n- If the bird is Cc (regardless of B): Checkered brown\n- If the bird is cc (regardless of B): Plain red\n- If the bird is bb (regardless of B): Plain brown\n\nBecause both C and B influence the phenotype. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotypes, overriding the effect of the other gene. So, even if a bird has bb (which makes it plain), but also has a dominant B allele, it's brown. Similarly, if it's CC, it's red regardless of B.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of the alleles, but each phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (any bird with at least one dominant C or B)\n2. Checkered brown (any bird with dominant C but not dominant B)\n3. Plain red (any bird with dominant c but not dominant B)\n4. Plain brown (any bird with dominant B but not dominant C)\n\nHowever, this might lead to some overlap. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has both dominant C and dominant B, it's red-brown. If it has dominant C and non-B, it's red. If it has dominant c and B, it's brown. If it has c and non-B, it's plain brown. If it has neither dominant C nor B, it's plain red. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Let me think clearly.\n\nActually, the phenotype depends on the alleles present, not their combination. So, any bird that has at least one dominant C will exhibit red, unless it also has a dominant B, in which case it's red-brown. Any bird that has at least one dominant B will exhibit brown, unless it also has a dominant c, in which case it's brown or plain depending on other factors. Wait, no\u2014in this case, the brown is always expressed if B is present, regardless of c. Similarly, red is expressed if C is present, regardless of b.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination is as follows:\n\n- Presence of dominant C (C_) \u2192 Red\n- Presence of dominant B (B_) \u2192 Brown\n- Both dominant \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Only dominant B \u2192 Brown\n- Only dominant C \u2192 Red\n- Neither dominant \u2192 Plain\n\nAdditionally, the presence of dominant c affects the appearance of the other traits. Wait, no\u2014the presence of dominant c (cc) makes the bird appear plain, regardless of other traits. So, if a bird is cc (plain), it will look like plain regardless of the B allele. Similarly, if a bird is Cc (checkered), it looks checkered, but if it's BB or Bb, it's brown.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- If the bird is CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- If the bird is Cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If the bird is cc \u2192 Plain red\n- If the bird is bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's oversimplifying. Because even within cc, the presence of B or b affects the phenotype beyond being plain. Wait, no\u2014the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, if a bird is cc, regardless of B, it's plain. If it's Cc, regardless of B, it's brown. Similarly, if it's BB or Bb, it's brown. If it's cc and B_, it's brown. If it's cc and b_, it's plain brown. Wait, but that's complicating things. Actually, the presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype, overriding the effect of the other gene. So, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 Checkered red\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n- Dominant c \u2192 Plain\n- Dominant b \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. For example, a bird with at least one dominant C will be red, regardless of B. A bird with at least one dominant B will be brown, regardless of C. A bird with at least one dominant c will be plain, regardless of B. A bird with at least one dominant b will be checkered, regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: C_ (regardless of B)\n- Checkered brown: B_ (regardless of C)\n- Plain red: cc (regardless of B)\n- Plain brown: bb (regardless of C)\n\nSo, now, we can count the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red: All individuals who have at least one dominant C.\n   - This includes: CC, Cc, Cc (but wait, Cc is present in two copies?), no, wait, in F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n   - CC (Checkered red)\n   - Cc (Checkered brown)\n   - cc (Plain red)\n   - bb (Plain brown)\n\nBut wait, the presence of C overrides B, and the presence of c overrides B. So, for each bird:\n\n- If they are CC or Cc \u2192 Checkered red\n- If they are Cc \u2192 brown (since B is not present)\n- If they are cc \u2192 plain red\n- If they are bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because a bird could have C_ (red) and B_, making it red-brown, or C_ and b_, making it checkered-red, etc. But according to the rules above, any bird with C_ will be red, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with B_ will be brown, regardless of C. Any bird with c_ will be plain, regardless of B. Any bird with b_ will be checkered, regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: C_ (regardless of B)\n- Checkered brown: B_ (regardless of C)\n- Plain red: cc (regardless of B)\n- Plain brown: bb (regardless of C)\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting because a bird cannot be both C_ and B_ simultaneously, except if C and B are both present. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's instead consider that the presence of dominant C makes it red, presence of dominant B makes it brown, presence of dominant c makes it plain, and presence of dominant b makes it checkered. These are mutually exclusive categories. For example:\n\n- If a bird has both C_ and B_: red-brown\n- If it has C_ and b_: checkered-red\n- If it has c_ and B_: brown\n- If it has c_ and b_: plain brown\n- If it has neither C nor B: plain red\n- If it has neither c nor B: checkered-red?\nWait, no\u2014because having neither c nor B would make it plain, but having neither c nor B could still have B or c?\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for F2 where each gene is independently assorting.\n\nIn F2, each parent is CcBb. So, for gene C, the F1 is Cc, and for gene B, it's Bb. So, in F2, each gene's alleles split into halves.\n\nSo, for gene C:\n\n- Half the F2 will be CC (probability 25%)\n- Half will be Cc (probability 50%)\n\nFor gene B:\n\n- Half will be BB (25%)\n- Half will be Bb (50%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% x 25% = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: 25% x 50% = 12.5%\n- CC bb: 25% x 25% = 6.25%\n- CC bb: same as above \u2192 6.25%\nWait, no\u2014each gene's distribution is separate. So, for gene C, half are CC, half are Cc. For gene B, half are BB, half are Bb. So, the F2 will have four combinations:\n\n1. CC (C) x BB (B) \u2192 CC BB\n2. CC (C) x Bb (B) \u2192 CC Bb\n3. Cc (C) x BB (B) \u2192 Cc BB\n4. Cc (C) x Bb (B) \u2192 Cc Bb\n\nAnd similarly, combinations with lowercase letters:\n\n5. CC (C) x bb (b) \u2192 CC bb\n6. CC (C) x bB (B) \u2192 CC bB (but this isn't possible because B and b are separate)\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene has two alleles, so for each gene, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb, etc. But in F2, the genotypes are determined by independent assortment.\n\nAlternatively, considering each gene separately:\n\n- Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- Gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these:\n\n- For gene C: CC, Cc, cc\n- For gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. CC bb (same as 3)\n5. Cc BB\n6. Cc Bb\n7. Cc bb\n8. Cc bb\n\nBut since each gene segregates independently, the actual combinations are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014each gene has 50% CC/Cc and 50% BB/Bb. So, the F2 genotypes would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 9 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2, 4, 5 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 3, 7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: Cases 6, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but this adds up to 2+3+2+2=9, which doesn't match any of the options. The options suggest higher numbers, such as 12 checkered red. This suggests that my approach may be flawed.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something in the way the phenotypes are defined. Let me revisit the definitions. The checkered pattern is controlled by C, and the plain by c. The brown is controlled by B, and the checkered by b. So, the presence of dominant C makes the bird checkered, regardless of B. The presence of dominant B makes it brown, regardless of C. The presence of dominant c makes it plain, regardless of anything else. The presence of dominant b makes it checkered, regardless of C.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So, a bird with at least one dominant C will be red, regardless of B. A bird with at least one dominant B will be brown, regardless of C. A bird with at least one dominant c will be plain, regardless of B. A bird with at least one dominant b will be checkered, regardless of C.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: C_ (regardless of B)\n2. Checkered brown: B_ (regardless of C)\n3. Plain red: cc (regardless of B)\n4. Plain brown: bb (regardless of C)\n\nWait, but this creates overlapping. For example, a bird with C_ and B_ would be red-brown, but according to the rules, it's considered red. Similarly, a bird with B_ and b_ would be brown. Wait, no\u2014the presence of dominant B makes it brown regardless of C, and the presence of dominant c makes it plain regardless of B. So, a bird with both B_ and b_ cannot exist because B and b are different alleles. Wait, no\u2014they're separate. So, a bird can have B_ and b_ only if it has both alleles, but in reality, a bird can only have two alleles for each gene. So, a bird can have B_ (at least one B) and b_ (at least one b), but those would require having both B and b alleles, which is impossible unless it's heterozygous for both genes. Wait, no\u2014a bird can't have both B and b alleles for the same gene. Each gene is governed by two alleles, so a bird can't have both B and b alleles for the same gene. So, in terms",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes might be expressed differently.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes might be expressed differently. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it using the Punnett square method without worrying too much about the order.\n\nBut perhaps the user already set up the gametes for F1 \u00d7 F1 as:\n\nGametes: (CB) (cb)\n\nSo when squaring, the F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield four combinations: CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB, CB \u00d7 cb = Cc BB, cb \u00d7 CB = Cc BB, cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb. Wait, but that doesn't account for the dominance. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. The actual F1 is CcBb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete: Cc (from C) and Bb (from B)\n- From cb gamete: cc (from c) and bb (from b)\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb. It will produce gametes as follows: The parent has two C's and two B's. Each gamete gets one C and one B. So the gametes are CB and cb. Each occurs at a 50% chance. So when F1 \u00d7 F1 happens, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut wait, dominance applies to each gene separately. So for the C locus, C is dominant over c, so CC and Cc will express red, and cc will express plain. Similarly, for the B locus, BB and Bb will express brown, and bb will express checkered. So the phenotype depends on both loci.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of these traits. Let's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that seems to suggest there are three phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, and plain brown. But looking back at the options provided, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That suggests four phenotypes. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes more genotypes due to independent assortment. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, then F2 would include all possible combinations, including those where both C and B are present (like CcBb, which would be brown checkered) and those where either C or B is missing (like ccBB would be red checkered, etc.).\n\nWait, but according to standard dihybrid cross results, the F2 would have a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, perhaps some categories combine. However, the options don't seem to match that exactly.\n\nLet me try another approach. Since each gene is independently assorting, the F2 would have the following:\n\nFor gene C: CC (red), Cc (red), cc (plain)\nFor gene B: BB (brown), Bb (brown), bb (checkered)\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cc BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n- 25% Cc bb (Checkered Checkered)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's eight phenotypes if we consider all combinations. But looking at the options, none directly mention eight phenotypes. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F2 ratio after considering only certain genotypes, like those where both genes are expressed.\n\nWait, but the user provided specific options, such as option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Let me see how that comes about.\n\nIf we consider the F2 genotypes, the phenotypes would depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive for each gene. For example:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (both dominant)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (since B is dominant)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1/8\n- Checkered Brown: 3/8 (since Cc appears in 3 cases: CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain Red: 1/8\n- Plain Brown: 3/8 (since cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc bb? Wait, no\u2014wait, cc BB is Plain Red, cc Bb is Plain Brown, and cc bb is Plain Checkered. Wait, that's inconsistent.)\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects us to ignore the dominance and count all phenotypes regardless of expression, leading to four phenotypes: Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown. In that case, the ratios would be 2 (Checkered Red) : 3 (Checkered Brown) : 2 (Plain Red) : 3 (Plain Brown). But that adds up to 10, which isn't listed in any option except E and G, which have different numbers.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. Summing to 16, which makes sense for 4^2=16. So perhaps that's the intended approach, treating each trait independently and counting the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype.\n\nIn that case, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (1)\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (3)\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (another 3)\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (another 3)\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (1)\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (3)\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered (3)\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (1)\n\nSo summing them up:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 3 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 total 9?\nWait, no, because each genotype corresponds to one phenotype, so:\n\nWait, each 25% contributes 1 to the count for their phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% * 1 = 1\n- Checkered Brown: 25% * 3 = 3\n- Plain Red: 25% * 1 = 1\n- Plain Brown: 25% * 3 = 3\n\nBut that sums to 8, which is not matching any of the given options. Perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each trait, the presence of dominant allele leads to the phenotype, and ignoring dominance for simplicity. Then, the F2 would have:\n\n- Both genes dominant: Checkered Red (1)\n- One dominant, one recessive: Checkered Brown (3)\n- Neither gene dominant: Plain Brown (3)\n- Both recessive: Plain Red (1)\n\nAdding up to 8, but the options don't have 8. Wait, but looking at option D: 1,3,9,3. That sums to 16. Hmm, perhaps the user considered that each gene has 4 outcomes, leading to 4x4=16 possible phenotypes, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included both genes' expressions, leading to more phenotypes. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Checkered Red 1, Checkered Brown 3, Plain Red 9, Plain Brown 3. This seems to group Checkered Red and Plain Red together, and Checkered Brown and Plain Brown together, but within each category, perhaps the counts add up differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the user grouped Checkered Red and Plain Red under one category, and similarly for brown. If that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered Red and Plain Red: 1 (Checkered) +1 (Plain) = 2\n- Checkered Brown and Plain Brown: 3 (Checkered) +3 (Plain) = 6\n\nBut that doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user counted the number of each phenotype irrespective of the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the F2 as having 9 genotypes, but each with their own phenotype, leading to the counts as per option D.\n\nWait, but in reality, the F2 would have:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (only from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 3 (from CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain Red: 1 (from cc BB)\n- Plain Brown: 3 (from cc Bb, Cc bb, cc bb)\n\nThat sums to 8. But none of the options have 8. However, option D has 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4^2 for each gene, indicating that each gene's effect is being considered individually, possibly accounting for dominance differently. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best answer is option D, as it accounts for the various combinations, even though the math doesn't perfectly align. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants us to disregard dominance and count each possibility, leading to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might be expressed differently. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it using the Punnett square method without worrying too much about the order.\n\nBut perhaps the user already set up the gametes for F1 \u00d7 F1 as:\n\nGametes: (CB) (cb)\n\nSo when squaring, the F1 \u00d7 F1 would yield four combinations: CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB, CB \u00d7 cb = Cc BB, cb \u00d7 CB = Cc BB, cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb. Wait, but that doesn't account for the dominance. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. The actual F1 is CcBb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB gamete: Cc (from C) and Bb (from B)\n- From cb gamete: cc (from c) and bb (from b)\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb. It will produce gametes as follows: The parent has two C's and two B's. Each gamete gets one C and one B. So the gametes are CB and cb. Each occurs at a 50% chance. So when F1 \u00d7 F1 happens, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut wait, dominance applies to each gene separately. So for the C locus, C is dominant over c, so CC and Cc will express red, and cc will express plain. Similarly, for the B locus, BB and Bb will express brown, and bb will express checkered. So the phenotype depends on both loci.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of these traits. Let's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but that seems to suggest there are three phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, and plain brown. But looking back at the options provided, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That suggests four phenotypes. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes more genotypes due to independent assortment. Wait, no\u2014if F1 is CcBb, then F2 would include all possible combinations, including those where both C and B are present (like CcBb, which would be brown checkered) and those where either C or B is missing (like ccBB would be red checkered, etc.).\n\nWait, but according to standard dihybrid cross results, the F2 would have a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, perhaps some categories combine. However, the options don't seem to match that exactly.\n\nLet me try another approach. Since each gene is independently assorting, the F2 would have the following:\n\nFor gene C: CC (red), Cc (red), cc (plain)\nFor gene B: BB (brown), Bb (brown), bb (checkered)\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cc BB (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n- 25% Cc bb (Checkered Checkered)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's eight phenotypes if we consider all combinations. But looking at the options, none directly mention eight phenotypes. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F2 ratio after considering only certain genotypes, like those where both genes are expressed.\n\nWait, but the user provided specific options, such as option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Let me see how that comes about.\n\nIf we consider the F2 genotypes, the phenotypes would depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive for each gene. For example:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (both dominant)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (since B is dominant)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, grouping similar phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1/8\n- Checkered Brown: 3/8 (since Cc appears in 3 cases: CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain Red: 1/8\n- Plain Brown: 3/8 (since cc Bb, Cc bb, and cc bb? Wait, no\u2014wait, cc BB is Plain Red, cc Bb is Plain Brown, and cc bb is Plain Checkered. Wait, that's inconsistent.)\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects us to ignore the dominance and count all phenotypes regardless of expression, leading to four phenotypes: Checkered Red, Checkered Brown, Plain Red, Plain Brown. In that case, the ratios would be 2 (Checkered Red) : 3 (Checkered Brown) : 2 (Plain Red) : 3 (Plain Brown). But that adds up to 10, which isn't listed in any option except E and G, which have different numbers.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3. Summing to 16, which makes sense for 4^2=16. So perhaps that's the intended approach, treating each trait independently and counting the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype.\n\nIn that case, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (1)\n- 25% CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (3)\n- 25% Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Brown (another 3)\n- 25% Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (another 3)\n- 25% cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (1)\n- 25% cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (3)\n- 25% Cc bb \u2192 Checkered Checkered (3)\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered (1)\n\nSo summing them up:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 3 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 total 9?\nWait, no, because each genotype corresponds to one phenotype, so:\n\nWait, each 25% contributes 1 to the count for their phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25% * 1 = 1\n- Checkered Brown: 25% * 3 = 3\n- Plain Red: 25% * 1 = 1\n- Plain Brown: 25% * 3 = 3\n\nBut that sums to 8, which is not matching any of the given options. Perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each trait, the presence of dominant allele leads to the phenotype, and ignoring dominance for simplicity. Then, the F2 would have:\n\n- Both genes dominant: Checkered Red (1)\n- One dominant, one recessive: Checkered Brown (3)\n- Neither gene dominant: Plain Brown (3)\n- Both recessive: Plain Red (1)\n\nAdding up to 8, but the options don't have 8. Wait, but looking at option D: 1,3,9,3. That sums to 16. Hmm, perhaps the user considered that each gene has 4 outcomes, leading to 4x4=16 possible phenotypes, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user included both genes' expressions, leading to more phenotypes. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Checkered Red 1, Checkered Brown 3, Plain Red 9, Plain Brown 3. This seems to group Checkered Red and Plain Red together, and Checkered Brown and Plain Brown together, but within each category, perhaps the counts add up differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the user grouped Checkered Red and Plain Red under one category, and similarly for brown. If that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered Red and Plain Red: 1 (Checkered) +1 (Plain) = 2\n- Checkered Brown and Plain Brown: 3 (Checkered) +3 (Plain) = 6\n\nBut that doesn't align with the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user counted the number of each phenotype irrespective of the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the F2 as having 9 genotypes, but each with their own phenotype, leading to the counts as per option D.\n\nWait, but in reality, the F2 would have:\n\n- Checkered Red: 1 (only from CC BB)\n- Checkered Brown: 3 (from CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain Red: 1 (from cc BB)\n- Plain Brown: 3 (from cc Bb, Cc bb, cc bb)\n\nThat sums to 8. But none of the options have 8. However, option D has 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4^2 for each gene, indicating that each gene's effect is being considered individually, possibly accounting for dominance differently. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best answer is option D, as it accounts for the various combinations, even though the math doesn't perfectly align. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants us to disregard dominance and count each possibility, leading to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?

    "chunk_resampled": "However, if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be CcBb, and their gametes would be CB and cb each at 50%.",
    "rollout": " However, if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be CcBb, and their gametes would be CB and cb each at 50%. Thus, the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each with a 25% chance. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the parents are not independent, but given that both are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach occurring at 25%, 50%, 25%, and 25% respectively. But wait, that adds up to 100%. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might not appear because of dominance. Wait, no\u2014because in the F1, the genotype is CcBb, so when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are indeed as above. Now, moving on to phenotypes. The traits are determined by the combination of alleles. For pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For pigmentation, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). So the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nThe possible combinations for pigment color are:\n\n- C (dominant) and B \u2192 Brown (B is dominant, regardless of c)\n- C and b \u2192 Checkered (b is recessive)\n- c (recessive) and B \u2192 Plain (since C is dominant)\n- c and b \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, but for pigmentation, it's B (dominant) over b. So any presence of B results in brown, while b makes it plain. Pigment color is determined independently, so the same applies here. Similarly, for the other gene, C (dominant) results in red, c makes it plain. Pigment is also determined independently. So the overall phenotype is a combination of both genes. So each bird's phenotype can be represented by two letters: one for pigment color and one for pigmentation.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and b \u2192 c, and b, but wait, no. Wait, C is for pigment, so C is dominant, so if C is present, pigment is red. If c is present, it's plain. Similarly, B is dominant, so brown, else plain. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.)\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are combinations where each gene contributes either dominant or recessive:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered brown (C and B)\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered plain (C and b)\n- If c is present and B is present \u2192 Plain brown (c and B)\n- If c is present and B is absent \u2192 Plain plain (c and b)\n\nNow, looking back at the F2 genotypes, we have:\n\n- 25% CC (both C and c present \u2192 Pigment red, but since C is dominant, it's red. Pigmentation: C is present, so brown. So phenotype: Checkered brown.\n- 25% Cc (C present, c absent \u2192 Pigment red; Pigmentation: C present \u2192 brown. So phenotype: Checkered brown.)\n- 25% cc (c present, c absent \u2192 Pigment plain; Pigmentation: c present \u2192 plain. So phenotype: Plain plain.)\n- 25% bb (c present, b present \u2192 Pigment plain; Pigmentation: b present \u2192 plain. So phenotype: Plain plain.)\n\nBut wait, that seems off because CcBb would mean C is present (so pigment is red), and B is present (brown), but wait, no\u2014it's C and B. Wait, but in the F2, the presence of C (C) means pigment red, and presence of B (B) means brown. So the phenotype is determined by both genes.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the F2, each bird is a combination of two genes. For pigment color (C): dominant C \u2192 red; recessive c \u2192 plain. For pigmentation (B): dominant B \u2192 brown; recessive b \u2192 checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is a combination of both traits. So:\n\nPhenotype = [Checkered or Plain] [Red or Brown]\n\nBecause:\n\n- If C is present (pigment red) and B is present (brown), then it's Checkered Brown.\n- If C present (red) and B absent (plain), it's Checkered Plain.\n- If c present (plain) and B present (brown), it's Plain Brown.\n- If c present (plain) and B absent (plain), it's Plain Plain.\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC: C is present (red), B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% Cc: C is present (red), B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc: c is present (plain), B is present (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 25% bb: c is present (plain), B is absent (plain) \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the F2, the distribution isn't uniform like that. Because for each gene, the segregation follows Mendelian ratios. Wait, no\u2014wait, the F2 comes from F1 selfing, which was generated from F1 which came from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. But I think my confusion arises from the fact that the parents are not independent. Wait, the parents are homozygous, so all their gametes are the same. So the F1 would be CcBb, and all its gametes would be CB and cb. Then, the F2 would be combinations of those.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is structured, the F2 is formed by F1 selfing, which is correct.\n\nSo, going back, the F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% BB? Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 genotypes depend on the segregation of each pair of genes independently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that for each gene, the segregation is independent. So for the pigment color gene (C and c):\n\n- In F1 (Cc), the segregation is 50% C and 50% c.\n\nSimilarly, for the pigmentation gene (B and b):\n\n- In F1 (Bb), the segregation is 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the two genes are linked or independent, the segregation for each gene is independent. Therefore, the F2 will have 25% CC (both C), 25% Cc (C and c), 25% cc (c and c), and 25% BB (B and B).\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. So the F1's gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So when F1 selfs, the F2 would be:\n\n- From CB gametes:\n   - CB + CB = CC\n   - CB + cb = Cc\n- From cb gametes:\n   - cb + CB = Cc\n   - cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb? Wait, no, because the F1 is CcBb, which when selfed, the possible gametes are CB and cb, leading to Cc and cc, but no bb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me correct myself. The F1 is CcBb. The possible gametes from Cc are CB and cb (each 50%) and from Bb are Bb (but wait, the F1 is CcBb, so the B locus is still Bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each gene is heterozygous. Therefore, the gametes from each gene are as follows:\n\nFor C (pale): C (dominant) and c (recessive). So gametes: CB and cb, each 50%.\n\nFor B (dark): B and b. So gametes: B and b, each 50%.\n\nSince the two genes are on different chromosomes, their segregation is independent. Therefore, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from B + b?) No, wait\u2014no, because each gene segregates independently. Wait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so for pigment color (C), the gametes are CB and cb, each 50%. For pigmentation (B), the gametes are B and b, each 50%. So the F2 would have:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- 50% C present (from CB gametes)\n- 50% c present (from cb gametes)\n\nFor pigmentation (B):\n- 50% B present (from B gametes)\n- 50% b present (from b gametes)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- To get Checkered Brown (C and B both present):\n  - Probability = (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- To get Checkered Plain (C and B both absent):\n  - Probability = (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n- To get Plain Brown (c and B present):\n  - Probability = (50% c) * (50% B) = 25%\n- To get Plain Plain (c and B absent):\n  - Probability = (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 100%, so that's correct.\n\nHowever, wait\u2014the F2 may not be exactly 25% for each phenotype due to linkage or other factors, but since the problem states \"adihybrid cross,\" perhaps it's considering two independent genes without linkage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the F2 refers to the F1 selfing, which would lead to the four phenotypes as described above.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided (A to J), let's analyze them:\n\nOption A: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 This suggests 6 of each, totaling 16. But according to our calculation, there should be 25% of each phenotype, which would be 4 each in a population of 16. So Option A seems too high.\n\nOption B: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16. Again, 8/16=50% checkered, 4+4=8 plain. Doesn't match our expectation.\n\nOption C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc. That seems inconsistent with our 25% per phenotype.\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. Again, 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. This seems off.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Not matching.\n\nOption F: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16 total. Each phenotype is equally likely, which matches our expectation of 25% each.\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16 total. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. That doesn't make sense.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 16 total. Again, uneven distribution.\n\nOption I: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total. Also uneven.\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16 total. Again, uneven.\n\nFrom the analysis, Option F is the only one that shows equal distribution across all phenotypes, i.e., each phenotype occurs 4 times, which aligns with the 25% each.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be CcBb, and their gametes would be CB and cb each at 50%. Thus, the F2 would have four possible genotypes, each with a 25% chance. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the parents are not independent, but given that both are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach occurring at 25%, 50%, 25%, and 25% respectively. But wait, that adds up to 100%. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might not appear because of dominance. Wait, no\u2014because in the F1, the genotype is CcBb, so when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are indeed as above. Now, moving on to phenotypes. The traits are determined by the combination of alleles. For pigment color, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For pigmentation, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered). So the phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nThe possible combinations for pigment color are:\n\n- C (dominant) and B \u2192 Brown (B is dominant, regardless of c)\n- C and b \u2192 Checkered (b is recessive)\n- c (recessive) and B \u2192 Plain (since C is dominant)\n- c and b \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, but for pigmentation, it's B (dominant) over b. So any presence of B results in brown, while b makes it plain. Pigment color is determined independently, so the same applies here. Similarly, for the other gene, C (dominant) results in red, c makes it plain. Pigment is also determined independently. So the overall phenotype is a combination of both genes. So each bird's phenotype can be represented by two letters: one for pigment color and one for pigmentation.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C and b \u2192 c, and b, but wait, no. Wait, C is for pigment, so C is dominant, so if C is present, pigment is red. If c is present, it's plain. Similarly, B is dominant, so brown, else plain. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.)\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are combinations where each gene contributes either dominant or recessive:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered brown (C and B)\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered plain (C and b)\n- If c is present and B is present \u2192 Plain brown (c and B)\n- If c is present and B is absent \u2192 Plain plain (c and b)\n\nNow, looking back at the F2 genotypes, we have:\n\n- 25% CC (both C and c present \u2192 Pigment red, but since C is dominant, it's red. Pigmentation: C is present, so brown. So phenotype: Checkered brown.\n- 25% Cc (C present, c absent \u2192 Pigment red; Pigmentation: C present \u2192 brown. So phenotype: Checkered brown.)\n- 25% cc (c present, c absent \u2192 Pigment plain; Pigmentation: c present \u2192 plain. So phenotype: Plain plain.)\n- 25% bb (c present, b present \u2192 Pigment plain; Pigmentation: b present \u2192 plain. So phenotype: Plain plain.)\n\nBut wait, that seems off because CcBb would mean C is present (so pigment is red), and B is present (brown), but wait, no\u2014it's C and B. Wait, but in the F2, the presence of C (C) means pigment red, and presence of B (B) means brown. So the phenotype is determined by both genes.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the F2, each bird is a combination of two genes. For pigment color (C): dominant C \u2192 red; recessive c \u2192 plain. For pigmentation (B): dominant B \u2192 brown; recessive b \u2192 checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is a combination of both traits. So:\n\nPhenotype = [Checkered or Plain] [Red or Brown]\n\nBecause:\n\n- If C is present (pigment red) and B is present (brown), then it's Checkered Brown.\n- If C present (red) and B absent (plain), it's Checkered Plain.\n- If c present (plain) and B present (brown), it's Plain Brown.\n- If c present (plain) and B absent (plain), it's Plain Plain.\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC: C is present (red), B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% Cc: C is present (red), B is present (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc: c is present (plain), B is present (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 25% bb: c is present (plain), B is absent (plain) \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the F2, the distribution isn't uniform like that. Because for each gene, the segregation follows Mendelian ratios. Wait, no\u2014wait, the F2 comes from F1 selfing, which was generated from F1 which came from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb. But I think my confusion arises from the fact that the parents are not independent. Wait, the parents are homozygous, so all their gametes are the same. So the F1 would be CcBb, and all its gametes would be CB and cb. Then, the F2 would be combinations of those.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is structured, the F2 is formed by F1 selfing, which is correct.\n\nSo, going back, the F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% BB? Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 genotypes depend on the segregation of each pair of genes independently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that for each gene, the segregation is independent. So for the pigment color gene (C and c):\n\n- In F1 (Cc), the segregation is 50% C and 50% c.\n\nSimilarly, for the pigmentation gene (B and b):\n\n- In F1 (Bb), the segregation is 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the two genes are linked or independent, the segregation for each gene is independent. Therefore, the F2 will have 25% CC (both C), 25% Cc (C and c), 25% cc (c and c), and 25% BB (B and B).\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. So the F1's gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So when F1 selfs, the F2 would be:\n\n- From CB gametes:\n   - CB + CB = CC\n   - CB + cb = Cc\n- From cb gametes:\n   - cb + CB = Cc\n   - cb + cb = cc\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb? Wait, no, because the F1 is CcBb, which when selfed, the possible gametes are CB and cb, leading to Cc and cc, but no bb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me correct myself. The F1 is CcBb. The possible gametes from Cc are CB and cb (each 50%) and from Bb are Bb (but wait, the F1 is CcBb, so the B locus is still Bb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each gene is heterozygous. Therefore, the gametes from each gene are as follows:\n\nFor C (pale): C (dominant) and c (recessive). So gametes: CB and cb, each 50%.\n\nFor B (dark): B and b. So gametes: B and b, each 50%.\n\nSince the two genes are on different chromosomes, their segregation is independent. Therefore, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from B + b?) No, wait\u2014no, because each gene segregates independently. Wait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so for pigment color (C), the gametes are CB and cb, each 50%. For pigmentation (B), the gametes are B and b, each 50%. So the F2 would have:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- 50% C present (from CB gametes)\n- 50% c present (from cb gametes)\n\nFor pigmentation (B):\n- 50% B present (from B gametes)\n- 50% b present (from b gametes)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- To get Checkered Brown (C and B both present):\n  - Probability = (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- To get Checkered Plain (C and B both absent):\n  - Probability = (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n- To get Plain Brown (c and B present):\n  - Probability = (50% c) * (50% B) = 25%\n- To get Plain Plain (c and B absent):\n  - Probability = (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 100%, so that's correct.\n\nHowever, wait\u2014the F2 may not be exactly 25% for each phenotype due to linkage or other factors, but since the problem states \"adihybrid cross,\" perhaps it's considering two independent genes without linkage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the F2 refers to the F1 selfing, which would lead to the four phenotypes as described above.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided (A to J), let's analyze them:\n\nOption A: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 This suggests 6 of each, totaling 16. But according to our calculation, there should be 25% of each phenotype, which would be 4 each in a population of 16. So Option A seems too high.\n\nOption B: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16. Again, 8/16=50% checkered, 4+4=8 plain. Doesn't match our expectation.\n\nOption C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc. That seems inconsistent with our 25% per phenotype.\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. Again, 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. This seems off.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Not matching.\n\nOption F: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16 total. Each phenotype is equally likely, which matches our expectation of 25% each.\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16 total. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. That doesn't make sense.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 16 total. Again, uneven distribution.\n\nOption I: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total. Also uneven.\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16 total. Again, uneven.\n\nFrom the analysis, Option F is the only one that shows equal distribution across all phenotypes, i.e., each phenotype occurs 4 times, which aligns with the 25% each. Therefore, the correct answer is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

CC BB (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb (dominant C and dominant B)\n3. CC bb (dominant C and recessive B \u2192 brown)\n4. CC bb \u2192 same as above.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, each gene is independent, so the F2 would have combinations of the two genes:\n\n- C: dominant (C) or recessive (c)\n- B: dominant (B) or recessive (b)\n\nThus, four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb (dominant C, dominant B)\n3. cc BB (recessive c, dominant B)\n4. cc bb (recessive c, recessive b)\n\nNow, phenotypically, each combination would present differently. Let's map the phenotypes:\n\n- C and B dominant: Checkered red\n- C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n- c dominant, B dominant: Plain red\n- c dominant, B recessive: Plain brown\n\nBut wait, the problem states that \"red\" is C dominant, \"brown\" is B dominant. So the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAdditionally, the bird's color is determined by the dominant allele C, while the color variation is determined by B. However, the description says that checkered is determined by the recessive allele c, so if both C and c are present, it's checkered. Similarly, brown is B, and red is B and c?\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states:\n\n- Dominant gene C controls pigment color.\n- R = dominant, r = recessive.\n\n- Dominant gene B controls color.\n- B = dominant, b = recessive.\n\nWait, but the colors are described as checkered (c), red (C), brown (B), and plain (b). So:\n\n- If a bird is heterozygous for both C and B (CcBB), it would look like red with some variation? Or does the color depend solely on the dominant alleles? This is getting confusing. Maybe the color is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for either C or B, it's colored according to those traits.\n\nBut perhaps the problem simplifies the phenotypes based on the dominant alleles:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): Checkered red\n- C (dominant) and B (recessive): Checkered brown\n- c (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain brown\n- c (recessive) and B (recessive): Plain red\n\nSimilarly, for pigment color:\n\n- C (dominant) and c (recessive): Red\n- c (recessive) and c (recessive): Checkered\n- c (recessive) and C (dominant): Plain red\n\nWait, no, Pigment color is determined by gene C. If C is present (even once), the bird looks red, regardless of B. Similarly, B being present makes it brown. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C or B, it's colored accordingly. If neither is present, it's checkered.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says:\n\n- \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo, any bird with at least one C allele is red, and any bird with at least one c allele is plain. Additionally, \"Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; and brown is expressed if the bird has at least one B allele, otherwise plain.\" So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C allele: red\n- If a bird has at least one dominant B allele: brown\n- Otherwise: plain\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant C or B allele. If both are present, it's a combination. If only one is present, it's that color. If none, then plain.\n\nSo, let's go back to the F2 generation. The possible genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc bb \u2192 c dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these genotypes contributes equally to the F2 generation, assuming independent assortment. So, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes with equal frequency. Wait, but the options given don't suggest equal distribution. They vary in numbers. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nThat sums up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4x4 grid, making sense for F2.\n\nAnother option is Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 5+3+2+6=16.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Using Mendelian inheritance, the probability for each genotype is 1/4 for each of the four possible combinations. Each genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nSo:\n\n- Probability of CC BB (Checkered red) is 1/4\n- Probability of CC Bb (Checkered brown) is 1/4\n- Probability of cc BB (Plain red) is 1/4\n- Probability of cc bb (Plain brown) is 1/4\n\nSince all four phenotypes have equal probability, each occurs 1/4 of the time. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which translates to 1,1,1,1 parts respectively.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Instead, the options group them into categories with totals adding to 16. So, checking the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 2, 6 \u2192 total 16, but this doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16, but doesn't fit our expectation.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16, but again, doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, which matches our expectations.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as D.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as D.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16, but doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, but doesn't fit.\n\nSo, among the options, both D, E, F, and H have the correct sum. But D and F have different distributions. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4. So why do the options differ? Because the way phenotypes are grouped might affect how we count. But in reality, each phenotype is equally likely, so the correct answer should reflect equal representation.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the mapping. For example, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red, else plain. If it has at least one B allele, it's brown, else plain. So the four phenotypes correspond to the presence of C, the presence of B, and neither. \n\nIn terms of counts, each combination should occur equally often. So the F2 generation should have four phenotypes, each occurring 1/4 of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But in the options, only D and F seem to have similar counts. However, my earlier analysis shows that each phenotype should appear 1/4 of the time, so the correct option should be D or F. But looking at the options, D and F are the only ones where the counts add up to 16. \n\nWait, but in reality, each of the four possible genotypes (and thus phenotypes) has a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, translating to 1,1,1,1 parts. However, in the options, D and F have different groupings. Option D groups checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (9), plain brown (3). That adds up to 16, and each category seems to follow the 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is the typical approach in F2 calculations, assuming a 3:1 ratio for each trait. So perhaps the question is grouping the phenotypes based on the number of dominant alleles, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio across all phenotypes combined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of phenotypic classes rather than individual genotypes, which could be misleading. But without further clarification, I'll proceed with the assumption that each phenotype is equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking back at the options, only option D and F have the same total but different groupings. Option D groups them as 1,3,9,3, which aligns with the 1:3:9:3 ratio, implying that each additional dominant allele increases the proportion in a squared manner. \n\nGiven that, the correct answer should be D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This reflects the 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio for each trait when considering the dominance hierarchy.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering dominance, the actual genotypes would be:\n\nFor the C gene (C is dominant over c):\n- CC and Cc (since c is recessive)\n\nFor the B gene (B is dominant over b):\n- BB and Bb (since b is recessive)\n\nSo the F2 would have four possible combinations:\n1. CC BB (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb (dominant C and dominant B)\n3. CC bb (dominant C and recessive B \u2192 brown)\n4. CC bb \u2192 same as above.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, each gene is independent, so the F2 would have combinations of the two genes:\n\n- C: dominant (C) or recessive (c)\n- B: dominant (B) or recessive (b)\n\nThus, four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (both dominant)\n2. CC Bb (dominant C, dominant B)\n3. cc BB (recessive c, dominant B)\n4. cc bb (recessive c, recessive b)\n\nNow, phenotypically, each combination would present differently. Let's map the phenotypes:\n\n- C and B dominant: Checkered red\n- C dominant, B recessive: Checkered brown\n- c dominant, B dominant: Plain red\n- c dominant, B recessive: Plain brown\n\nBut wait, the problem states that \"red\" is C dominant, \"brown\" is B dominant. So the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAdditionally, the bird's color is determined by the dominant allele C, while the color variation is determined by B. However, the description says that checkered is determined by the recessive allele c, so if both C and c are present, it's checkered. Similarly, brown is B, and red is B and c?\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states:\n\n- Dominant gene C controls pigment color.\n- R = dominant, r = recessive.\n\n- Dominant gene B controls color.\n- B = dominant, b = recessive.\n\nWait, but the colors are described as checkered (c), red (C), brown (B), and plain (b). So:\n\n- If a bird is heterozygous for both C and B (CcBB), it would look like red with some variation? Or does the color depend solely on the dominant alleles? This is getting confusing. Maybe the color is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for either C or B, it's colored according to those traits.\n\nBut perhaps the problem simplifies the phenotypes based on the dominant alleles:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): Checkered red\n- C (dominant) and B (recessive): Checkered brown\n- c (recessive) and B (dominant): Plain brown\n- c (recessive) and B (recessive): Plain red\n\nSimilarly, for pigment color:\n\n- C (dominant) and c (recessive): Red\n- c (recessive) and c (recessive): Checkered\n- c (recessive) and C (dominant): Plain red\n\nWait, no, Pigment color is determined by gene C. If C is present (even once), the bird looks red, regardless of B. Similarly, B being present makes it brown. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C or B, it's colored accordingly. If neither is present, it's checkered.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says:\n\n- \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo, any bird with at least one C allele is red, and any bird with at least one c allele is plain. Additionally, \"Brown color is controlled by a dominant gene B; and brown is expressed if the bird has at least one B allele, otherwise plain.\" So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C allele: red\n- If a bird has at least one dominant B allele: brown\n- Otherwise: plain\n\nTherefore, the phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant C or B allele. If both are present, it's a combination. If only one is present, it's that color. If none, then plain.\n\nSo, let's go back to the F2 generation. The possible genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n4. cc bb \u2192 c dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these genotypes contributes equally to the F2 generation, assuming independent assortment. So, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes with equal frequency. Wait, but the options given don't suggest equal distribution. They vary in numbers. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nThat sums up to 1+3+9+3=16, which is 4x4 grid, making sense for F2.\n\nAnother option is Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 5+3+2+6=16.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Using Mendelian inheritance, the probability for each genotype is 1/4 for each of the four possible combinations. Each genotype corresponds to a specific phenotype.\n\nSo:\n\n- Probability of CC BB (Checkered red) is 1/4\n- Probability of CC Bb (Checkered brown) is 1/4\n- Probability of cc BB (Plain red) is 1/4\n- Probability of cc bb (Plain brown) is 1/4\n\nSince all four phenotypes have equal probability, each occurs 1/4 of the time. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which translates to 1,1,1,1 parts respectively.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Instead, the options group them into categories with totals adding to 16. So, checking the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 2, 6 \u2192 total 16, but this doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16, but doesn't fit our expectation.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16, but again, doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, which matches our expectations.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 same as D.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as D.\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16, but doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, but doesn't fit.\n\nSo, among the options, both D, E, F, and H have the correct sum. But D and F have different distributions. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4. So why do the options differ? Because the way phenotypes are grouped might affect how we count. But in reality, each phenotype is equally likely, so the correct answer should reflect equal representation.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the mapping. For example, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red, else plain. If it has at least one B allele, it's brown, else plain. So the four phenotypes correspond to the presence of C, the presence of B, and neither. \n\nIn terms of counts, each combination should occur equally often. So the F2 generation should have four phenotypes, each occurring 1/4 of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But in the options, only D and F seem to have similar counts. However, my earlier analysis shows that each phenotype should appear 1/4 of the time, so the correct option should be D or F. But looking at the options, D and F are the only ones where the counts add up to 16. \n\nWait, but in reality, each of the four possible genotypes (and thus phenotypes) has a 25% chance. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, translating to 1,1,1,1 parts. However, in the options, D and F have different groupings. Option D groups checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (9), plain brown (3). That adds up to 16, and each category seems to follow the 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is the typical approach in F2 calculations, assuming a 3:1 ratio for each trait. So perhaps the question is grouping the phenotypes based on the number of dominant alleles, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio across all phenotypes combined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the number of phenotypic classes rather than individual genotypes, which could be misleading. But without further clarification, I'll proceed with the assumption that each phenotype is equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking back at the options, only option D and F have the same total but different groupings. Option D groups them as 1,3,9,3, which aligns with the 1:3:9:3 ratio, implying that each additional dominant allele increases the proportion in a squared manner. \n\nGiven that, the correct answer should be D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This reflects the 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio for each trait when considering the dominance hierarchy.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes might look the same phenotypically.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes might look the same phenotypically. But for the purpose of this problem, we'll consider the actual genotypes regardless of phenotype.\n\nWait, but the question asks for phenotypic ratios, not genotypic. So we need to map the genotypes to phenotypes. Let's see:\n\nEach bird has two genes: C and B. Gene C determines pigment color (dominant R, recessive P); gene B determines color (dominant W, recessive Y).\n\nSo the possible genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is dominant, and B is dominant)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (B is dominant over b)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (c is recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (B dominant over b)\n\nBut wait, the user listed the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So yes, that matches our expectations.\n\nNow, the F2 generation would be composed of these genotypes in various proportions. To determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate how many of each genotype there are in F2.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): probability = (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Cc (from CB + cb): probability = (1/2 * 1/2) + (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/2\n- cc (from cb + cb): probability = 1/4\n- bb (from cb + cb): probability = 1/4\n\nWait, no\u2014that's if each gamete is 50% CB and 50% cb. So the probabilities are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply. So for each combination, like CC BB, it's 25% (for CC) times 25% (for BB) = 6.25%.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct way is to combine the probabilities for each gene independently. Since each gene is assorting independently, the overall probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo for example, the probability of CC BB is (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, CC Bb is (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%.\n\nCc BB is (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%.\n\nCc Bb is (50%) * (50%) = 25%.\n\nAnd then for the recessive traits:\n\ncc bb is (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because each gene is independent, the combined probabilities would indeed be the product. Let me double-check:\n\nTotal F2 population: 100%\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- CC BB: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25% C) * (50% B) = 12.5%\n- Cc BB: (50% C) * (25% B) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- cc BB: (25% c) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25% c) * (50% B) = 12.5%\n- cc bb: (25% c) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n- c c b b: 6.25%\n\nWait, but there are eight possible phenotypes, but the question lists four: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, but according to our mapping, the phenotypes are based on the combination of C and B. So the four phenotypes correspond to the four possible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nTherefore, the F2 population will be distributed among these four phenotypes in proportion to the number of each genotype multiplied by the probability of each genotype occurring.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CC BB): 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown (CC Bb): 12.5%\n3. Plain Red (cc BB): 6.25%\n4. Plain Brown (cc Bb): 12.5%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 40%, which makes sense because the total must add up to 100%.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 6.25 : 12.5 : 6.25 : 12.5\n\nSimplifying by multiplying each by 16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n(6.25 * 16) : (12.5 * 16) : (6.25 * 16) : (12.5 * 16) = 100 : 200 : 100 : 200\n\nWhich simplifies further to 1:2:1:2.\n\nBut looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at the options, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems different. Alternatively, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't match my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, each parent is CcBb. When selfed, the F2 should have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, but hold on: In dihybrid crosses where both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But wait, in our case, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes, so the four phenotypes correspond to the four possible genotypic combinations. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Wait, but that adds up to 16 parts. But earlier, I thought the actual count was 100%. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, I see now. The confusion arises because when dealing with dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio isn't directly 9:3:3:1 unless both genes are segregating independently. In reality, the phenotypic ratio depends on whether the genes are linked or not. If the genes are linked (i.e., they are on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together), the ratio changes. However, in this case, since the problem states to use the standard approach without considering linkage, we proceed under the assumption that the genes are independent.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I considered each gene separately and calculated the probabilities. However, the correct approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes, leading to four possible phenotypes. The 9:3:3:1 ratio refers to the number of each genotype, not the number of each phenotype. So perhaps the confusion arises from misapplying the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects us to compute the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let me recalculate.\n\nGiven the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CCBB x ccbb):\n\nThe F2 phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes, corresponding to the combinations of the two genes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (9 parts)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (3 parts)\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (3 parts)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (1 part)\n\nAdding these gives 16 parts total. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown.\n\nBut none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me review the options:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nHmm, that sums to 5+3+2+6=16, but the ratio is 5:3:2:6, which is different from 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the question is considering only the phenotypes based on whether the coat is red or brown, regardless of the presence of the 'c' allele. For instance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele (either C or B), it could be red or brown, depending on which allele is present. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the 'c' allele determines whether it's plain or brown, irrespective of the other gene.\n\nWait, in any case, the dihybrid cross for two independent genes usually results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. So if the question expects this, the phenotypic ratio would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking back at the options, none of them match this exact ratio. Let's check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Which is 1:3:9:3, reversed.\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I've miscalculated the actual numbers. Let me try again.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes. The sum is 16 parts, but the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options A-F match this exactly. Looking back at the original question, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\"\n\nThat sums to 16. But according to the dihybrid cross, it should be 9:3:3:1. So either the options are wrong, or I've made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of the F2. Wait, the question specifies F2, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's F2 itself, not the entire F2 generation. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, but mistakenly wrote F2.\n\nAssuming the user meant F2, but the options don't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nWhen F1 (CCBB \u00d7 ccbb) is crossed, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete with 50% chance of being CB or cb.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CC Bb (50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (25%)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (50%)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (25%)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n\nWait, that's four phenotypes, each at 25% except checkered brown is at 50%. So the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1.\n\nTranslating to phenotypic classes, checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown is 2 parts, plain red is 1 part, plain brown is 1 part. Summing to 5 parts, which doesn't add up to 100%, indicating an error in reasoning.\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be 25% CC BB, 50% CC Bb, 25% cc bb, 25% cc Bb. So that's 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%, but each percentage represents the proportion of the F2 population. So the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, meaning checkered red (smallest), followed by checkered brown, then plain red, and plain brown (largest). Translating into counts, if we assume 100% of F2, then:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 50%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nSo the ratio is 1:2:1:1. But looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 which is reverse.\n\nWait, perhaps the user mixed up the order. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a different ratio. That doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nIf checkered red is the smallest, then checkered brown next, etc., the ratio should be 1:2:1:1. None of the options match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers the presence of the 'c' allele as determining the phenotype, which would change the outcome.\n\nWait, another approach: The presence of the 'c' allele (recessive) affects the phenotype beyond the coat color. So, even if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (C or B), it may still display brown (if B is present) or red (if c is present). This complicates things because it introduces a third phenotype: plain red (only c) or brown (has B).\n\nBut in this case, the question specifically mentions checking for red and brown, so perhaps the presence of B is sufficient to determine brown, while c determines plain red. But the user didn't specify this in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is only considering coat color, ignoring the pigmentation effect of B. In that case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the presence of the 'c' allele. So, if a bird has at least one 'c' allele, it's plain red; otherwise, it's brown. Additionally, the pigment color (C) determines whether it's red or brown within the plain red category.\n\nIn that scenario, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Plain Red (any bird with c)\n- Brown (any bird with B)\n\nAnd the presence of C determines if it's red or brown. So, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the proportion of each genotype.\n\nLet's model this:\n\nFor each bird, the genotype determines whether it's plain red or brown, and the presence of C determines red or brown within plain red.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of 9:3:3:1 genotypic ratios, as per the dihybrid cross. But the phenotypic distribution would be adjusted based on the dominance of B.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- For each bird, if they have at least one 'c' allele (phenotype plain red), then their pigment color is determined by C:\n   - If they have at least one C (phenotype red), else brown.\n- For birds without any 'c' (phenotype brown), their pigment color is determined by C:\n   - If they have at least one C, red; else brown.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, all birds with 'c' are plain red, and those without 'c' can be red or brown based on C.\n\nSo let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\n1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes might look the same phenotypically. But for the purpose of this problem, we'll consider the actual genotypes regardless of phenotype.\n\nWait, but the question asks for phenotypic ratios, not genotypic. So we need to map the genotypes to phenotypes. Let's see:\n\nEach bird has two genes: C and B. Gene C determines pigment color (dominant R, recessive P); gene B determines color (dominant W, recessive Y).\n\nSo the possible genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is dominant, and B is dominant)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (B is dominant over b)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (c is recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (B dominant over b)\n\nBut wait, the user listed the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So yes, that matches our expectations.\n\nNow, the F2 generation would be composed of these genotypes in various proportions. To determine the phenotypic ratio, we need to calculate how many of each genotype there are in F2.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): probability = (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Cc (from CB + cb): probability = (1/2 * 1/2) + (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/2\n- cc (from cb + cb): probability = 1/4\n- bb (from cb + cb): probability = 1/4\n\nWait, no\u2014that's if each gamete is 50% CB and 50% cb. So the probabilities are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities multiply. So for each combination, like CC BB, it's 25% (for CC) times 25% (for BB) = 6.25%.\n\nWait, no\u2014the correct way is to combine the probabilities for each gene independently. Since each gene is assorting independently, the overall probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo for example, the probability of CC BB is (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%.\n\nSimilarly, CC Bb is (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%.\n\nCc BB is (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%.\n\nCc Bb is (50%) * (50%) = 25%.\n\nAnd then for the recessive traits:\n\ncc bb is (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because each gene is independent, the combined probabilities would indeed be the product. Let me double-check:\n\nTotal F2 population: 100%\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- CC BB: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25% C) * (50% B) = 12.5%\n- Cc BB: (50% C) * (25% B) = 12.5%\n- Cc Bb: (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- cc BB: (25% c) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25% c) * (50% B) = 12.5%\n- cc bb: (25% c) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n- c c b b: 6.25%\n\nWait, but there are eight possible phenotypes, but the question lists four: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, but according to our mapping, the phenotypes are based on the combination of C and B. So the four phenotypes correspond to the four possible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nTherefore, the F2 population will be distributed among these four phenotypes in proportion to the number of each genotype multiplied by the probability of each genotype occurring.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CC BB): 6.25%\n2. Checkered Brown (CC Bb): 12.5%\n3. Plain Red (cc BB): 6.25%\n4. Plain Brown (cc Bb): 12.5%\n\nAdding these up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 40%, which makes sense because the total must add up to 100%.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 6.25 : 12.5 : 6.25 : 12.5\n\nSimplifying by multiplying each by 16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n(6.25 * 16) : (12.5 * 16) : (6.25 * 16) : (12.5 * 16) = 100 : 200 : 100 : 200\n\nWhich simplifies further to 1:2:1:2.\n\nBut looking back at the options given:\n\nLooking at the options, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems different. Alternatively, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't match my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, each parent is CcBb. When selfed, the F2 should have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, but hold on: In dihybrid crosses where both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But wait, in our case, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes, so the four phenotypes correspond to the four possible genotypic combinations. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Wait, but that adds up to 16 parts. But earlier, I thought the actual count was 100%. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, I see now. The confusion arises because when dealing with dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio isn't directly 9:3:3:1 unless both genes are segregating independently. In reality, the phenotypic ratio depends on whether the genes are linked or not. If the genes are linked (i.e., they are on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together), the ratio changes. However, in this case, since the problem states to use the standard approach without considering linkage, we proceed under the assumption that the genes are independent.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I considered each gene separately and calculated the probabilities. However, the correct approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two genes, leading to four possible phenotypes. The 9:3:3:1 ratio refers to the number of each genotype, not the number of each phenotype. So perhaps the confusion arises from misapplying the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects us to compute the phenotypic ratio based on the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let me recalculate.\n\nGiven the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CCBB x ccbb):\n\nThe F2 phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes, corresponding to the combinations of the two genes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (9 parts)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (3 parts)\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (3 parts)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (1 part)\n\nAdding these gives 16 parts total. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, translating to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown.\n\nBut none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me review the options:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nHmm, that sums to 5+3+2+6=16, but the ratio is 5:3:2:6, which is different from 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the question is considering only the phenotypes based on whether the coat is red or brown, regardless of the presence of the 'c' allele. For instance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele (either C or B), it could be red or brown, depending on which allele is present. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the 'c' allele determines whether it's plain or brown, irrespective of the other gene.\n\nWait, in any case, the dihybrid cross for two independent genes usually results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. So if the question expects this, the phenotypic ratio would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking back at the options, none of them match this exact ratio. Let's check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Which is 1:3:9:3, reversed.\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I've miscalculated the actual numbers. Let me try again.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of the two genes. The sum is 16 parts, but the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options A-F match this exactly. Looking back at the original question, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\"\n\nThat sums to 16. But according to the dihybrid cross, it should be 9:3:3:1. So either the options are wrong, or I've made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of the F2. Wait, the question specifies F2, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's F2 itself, not the entire F2 generation. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 generation, but mistakenly wrote F2.\n\nAssuming the user meant F2, but the options don't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nWhen F1 (CCBB \u00d7 ccbb) is crossed, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nEach parent contributes a gamete with 50% chance of being CB or cb.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CC Bb (50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (25%)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (50%)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (25%)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (25%)\n\nWait, that's four phenotypes, each at 25% except checkered brown is at 50%. So the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1.\n\nTranslating to phenotypic classes, checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown is 2 parts, plain red is 1 part, plain brown is 1 part. Summing to 5 parts, which doesn't add up to 100%, indicating an error in reasoning.\n\nWait, no\u2014it should be 25% CC BB, 50% CC Bb, 25% cc bb, 25% cc Bb. So that's 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%, but each percentage represents the proportion of the F2 population. So the ratio is 25:50:25:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1:1.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:1, meaning checkered red (smallest), followed by checkered brown, then plain red, and plain brown (largest). Translating into counts, if we assume 100% of F2, then:\n\n- Checkered Red: 25%\n- Checkered Brown: 50%\n- Plain Red: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n\nSo the ratio is 1:2:1:1. But looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 which is reverse.\n\nWait, perhaps the user mixed up the order. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a different ratio. That doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nIf checkered red is the smallest, then checkered brown next, etc., the ratio should be 1:2:1:1. None of the options match this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers the presence of the 'c' allele as determining the phenotype, which would change the outcome.\n\nWait, another approach: The presence of the 'c' allele (recessive) affects the phenotype beyond the coat color.

So, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the proportion of each genotype.\n\nLet's model this:\n\nFor each bird, the genotype determines whether it's plain red or brown, and the presence of C determines red or brown within plain red.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of 9:3:3:1 genotypic ratios, as per the dihybrid cross. But the phenotypic distribution would be adjusted based on the dominance of B.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- For each bird, if they have at least one 'c' allele (phenotype plain red), then their pigment color is determined by C:\n   - If they have at least one C (phenotype red), else brown.\n- For birds without any 'c' (phenotype brown), their pigment color is determined by C:\n   - If they have at least one C, red; else brown.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, all birds with 'c' are plain red, and those without 'c' can be red or brown based on C.\n\nSo let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Plain Red (all birds with at least one 'c'):\n   - Number of such birds: 100% - 25% (cc) = 75%\n   \n   Among these, C determines color:\n   - 50% have at least one C (red), 50% have c (brown).\n   \n   So,Plain Red red: 75% * 50% = 37.5%\n   \n   Plain Red brown: 75% * 50% = 37.5%\n   \n2.

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, the presence of multiple genes complicates things. Alternatively, considering each gene separately might help. Let me approach this differently by looking at each gene separately.\n\nFirst, consider the C locus: Parent 1 (CC) and Parent 2 (cc). The F1 will be Cc, and the F2 will be CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Similarly, for the B locus: Parent 1 (BB) and Parent 2 (bb). The F1 will be Bb, and the F2 will be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Since the loci are independent, the combination of these probabilities will give us the overall F2 genotype probabilities.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe combination is:\n\n- 25% for CC BB\n- 25% for CC Bb (since CC from C locus and BB from B locus)\n- 25% for CC bb (CC and bb)\n- 25% for Cc BB (Cc and BB)\n- 25% for Cc Bb (Cc and Bb)\n- 25% for Cc bb (Cc and bb)\n- 25% for cc BB (cc and BB)\n- 25% for cc Bb (cc and Bb)\n- 25% for cc bb (cc and bb)\n\nWait, that seems off because there are nine possible combinations, but some are impossible due to dominance. Actually, for each gene, the dominant allele takes precedence. So for the C locus, the genotype will be dominant if either allele is present. Similarly for the B locus.\n\nBut to get the actual phenotype, we need to determine whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For example, for the C locus:\n\n- If an individual has at least one C allele, they are red (dominant).\n- Only those with two recessive C alleles (cc) are plain.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Dominant B means brown.\n- Only bb results in checkered.\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypes, we'll look at each gene's effect and combine them. Let's go through each F2 genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Both dominant, so red and brown \u2192 Checkered red.\n2. **CC Bb**: C dominant (so red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n3. **CC bb**: C dominant (red), b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain red.\n4. **Cc BB**: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n5. **Cc Bb**: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n6. **Cc bb**: C dominant (red), b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain red.\n7. **cc BB**: Both recessive, so plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n8. **cc Bb**: Both recessive, so plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n9. **cc bb**: Both recessive, so plain and checkered \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So any presence of a dominant allele will express the corresponding trait. So for the C locus, any presence of C (either dominant or recessive) will result in red color, unless both alleles are recessive (cc), resulting in plain. Similarly for the B locus.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's re-examine each F2 genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB** \u2192 C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered red.\n2. **CC Bb** \u2192 C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown.\n3. **CC bb** \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain red.\n4. **Cc BB** \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown.\n5. **Cc Bb** \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown.\n6. **Cc bb** \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain red.\n7. **cc BB** \u2192 c and B dominant \u2192 Plain brown.\n8. **cc Bb** \u2192 c and B dominant \u2192 Plain brown.\n9. **cc bb** \u2192 c and b recessive \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nSo, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered red (CR)**: Cases where both genes are dominant \u2192 1 case (CC BB)\n- **Checkered brown (CB)**: Cases where C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Cases 2,4,5, which are three cases?\nWait, no, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- CR occurs in CC BB \u2192 1\n- CB occurs in CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Cb occurs in CC bb, cC BB, cC Bb \u2192 but wait, does cB appear?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all nine F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 CR\n2. CC Bb \u2192 CB\n3. CC bb \u2192 Cb (Plain red)\n4. cC BB \u2192 CB\n5. cC Bb \u2192 CB\n6. cC bb \u2192 Cb (Plain red)\n7. cc BB \u2192 cb (Plain brown)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 cb (Plain brown)\n9. cc bb \u2192 cb (Plain checkered)\n\nSo now, count:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: cases 2,4,5 \u2192 3\n- Cb: cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- cb: cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n\nWait, but hold on. In the original options, I see options like A, B, etc., which include counts like 6,2, etc. So I must have miscounted. Let me make a table:\n\nF2 Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered red (CR)\nCC Bb | Checkered brown (CB)\nCC bb | Plain red (Cb)\nCc BB | Checkered brown (CB)\nCc Bb | Checkered brown (CB)\nCc bb | Plain red (Cb)\ncc BB | Plain brown (cb)\ncc Bb | Plain brown (cb)\ncc bb | Plain checkered (Cb)\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: 3 (cases 2,4,5)\n- Cb: 2 (cases 3,6)\n- cb: 3 (cases7,8,9)\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought there were 9 cases, but according to this table, CR is 1, CB is 3, Cb is 2, and cb is 3. That adds up to 9.\n\nBut none of the options given seem to match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\nE. 3,9,1,3\nF. 4,4,4,4\nG. 12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, none of these seem to match my current count of 1 CR, 3 CB, 2 Cb, 3 cb. This suggests I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Maybe I misunderstood the dominance rules.\n\nLet me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. For each gene, the presence of a dominant allele overrides the recessive one. So for the C locus, any C allele makes the bird red, regardless of whether it's dominant or recessive. Similarly for the B locus, any B allele makes it brown, regardless of whether it's dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, but in the F2 calculations, I considered the dominance of each allele independently. However, in reality, the presence of even one dominant allele in a gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So, for example, in the C locus, if a bird has at least one C allele (either C or c), it expresses red color, regardless of whether it's C (dominant) or cc (recessive).\n\nBut in the F2 calculation, the genotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. So, for each gene, we need to determine if the dominant allele is present. Let's redo the phenotype determination based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nEach F2 genotype can be categorized into the following categories:\n\n1. Both genes have dominant alleles (C and B): Checkered red (CR)\n2. One gene has a dominant allele, the other doesn't: Checkered brown (CB)\n3. Neither gene has a dominant allele (both recessive): Plain red (Cr) and checkered (Cb) combined? Wait, no. Wait, if neither gene has a dominant allele, then both are recessive, so C and B are recessive, making it plain. And also, since both are recessive, the other gene would have to be checked. Wait, no, both genes have recessive alleles, so the bird is plain and also has no dominant traits. Hmm, but in reality, a bird that is pure recessive for both genes (cc bb) would be plain (for C) and plain (for B), but wait, no\u2014that's not right. Because the presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to the respective trait. So a bird that is cc bb (both recessive) would have both traits expressed as recessive, meaning it would be plain (no C or B dominant) and also plain (no checkered for B). Wait, but in reality, a bird that is cc bb would be plain (no C) and plain (no B), so it's plain. Similarly, a bird that is CC bb would be red (from C) and plain (from B), so it's plain red. A bird that is CC BB would be red (from C) and brown (from B), so it's checkered brown. A bird that is Cc BB would be red (from C) and brown (from B), so checkered brown. A bird that is Cc Bb would be red and brown, so checkered brown. A bird that is Cc bb would be red and plain, so plain red. A bird that is cc BB would be plain and brown, so plain brown. A bird that is cc Bb would be plain and brown, so plain brown. A bird that is cc bb would be plain and plain, so plain checkered.\n\nWait, so applying this logic:\n\n- CR: CC BB \u2192 red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB: CC Bb \u2192 same as CR \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cb: CC bb \u2192 red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 plain red\n- CB: Cc BB \u2192 same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CB: Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cb: Cc bb \u2192 red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 plain red\n- cb: cc BB \u2192 plain (C) and brown (B) \u2192 plain brown\n- cb: cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 plain brown\n- cb: cc bb \u2192 plain (C) and plain (B) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: 3 (cases 2,4,5)\n- Cb: 2 (cases 3,6)\n- cb: 3 (cases7,8,9)\n\nThis sums up to 9, which matches our previous total.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which isn't matching our counts. Option H says \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which also doesn't match. Option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014again, not matching. Option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\u2014this doesn't add up to 9 birds, as per our count. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014also doesn't add up. Option F is \"4,4,4,4\"\u2014nope. Option C is \"9,3,3,1\"\u2014which aligns with our counts except for the order.\n\nWait, the options are listed as:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nOur count was 1 CR, 3 CB, 2 Cb, 3 cb. None of the options exactly match this. The closest is option C, which states Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This doesn't match our numbers. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the F2 generation is being calculated incorrectly. Let me try another approach by using a Punnett square for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross. The F1 is CcBb. So the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio if considering each gene separately, but since the genes are linked, the actual ratio depends on their recombination frequency. However, the problem doesn't provide any recombination data, implying that the genes assort independently.\n\nAssuming independence, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for dominance. Let's compute the phenotypes accordingly.\n\nEach F2 genotype contributes to the next generation based on their fitness, but since we're dealing with phenotypic ratios, we can ignore fitness values and focus on the relative occurrence of each genotype.\n\nUsing the formula for independent assortment:\n\nProportions for each genotype are:\n\n- CC BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- cC BB: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cC Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- cc BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8 \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, converting these fractions to percentages:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16 = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 3*(1/8) = 37.5%\n- Plain red: 2*(1/16) = 12.5%\n- Plain brown: 2*(1/8) = 25%\n- Plain checkered: 1/16 = 6.25%\n\nBut the options don't reflect decimal percentages. Instead, they give whole numbers. So rounding to the nearest whole number:\n\n- Checkered red: 6%\n- Checkered brown: 37.5% \u2248 38% \u2192 But in the options, the highest is 9, so this approach may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented without considering exact percentages but rather the sum of certain groups.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes, ignoring the dominance hierarchy beyond what's already done. Let me proceed with that.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of the 9 possible genotypes has a different probability. As calculated earlier, the probabilities are:\n\n- CR: 1/16 \u2192 6.25% \u2192 1 bird\n- CB: 3/16 \u2192 ~18.75% \u2192 3 birds\n- Cb: 2/16 \u2192 12.5% \u2192 2 birds\n- cb: 3/16 \u2192 ~18.75% \u2192 3 birds\n\nAdding up to 9 birds.\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n- CR: 1 bird (Checkered red)\n- CB: 3 birds (Checkered brown)\n- Cb: 2 birds (Plain red)\n- cb: 3 birds (Plain red)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 3 : 2 : 3.\n\nLooking at the options, this corresponds to option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, no, that's not matching. Option J says 2:6:3:1, which doesn't fit. Option C has 9:3:3:1, which is similar but the numbers don't match. Option G has 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which doesn't match either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the F2 generation. Let me double-check the Punnett square for the dihybrid cross. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 should be generated by squaring this, resulting in 9 possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (50%)\n3",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the presence of multiple genes complicates things. Alternatively, considering each gene separately might help. Let me approach this differently by looking at each gene separately.\n\nFirst, consider the C locus: Parent 1 (CC) and Parent 2 (cc). The F1 will be Cc, and the F2 will be CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%). Similarly, for the B locus: Parent 1 (BB) and Parent 2 (bb). The F1 will be Bb, and the F2 will be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Since the loci are independent, the combination of these probabilities will give us the overall F2 genotype probabilities.\n\nSo, for each gene:\n\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe combination is:\n\n- 25% for CC BB\n- 25% for CC Bb (since CC from C locus and BB from B locus)\n- 25% for CC bb (CC and bb)\n- 25% for Cc BB (Cc and BB)\n- 25% for Cc Bb (Cc and Bb)\n- 25% for Cc bb (Cc and bb)\n- 25% for cc BB (cc and BB)\n- 25% for cc Bb (cc and Bb)\n- 25% for cc bb (cc and bb)\n\nWait, that seems off because there are nine possible combinations, but some are impossible due to dominance. Actually, for each gene, the dominant allele takes precedence. So for the C locus, the genotype will be dominant if either allele is present. Similarly for the B locus.\n\nBut to get the actual phenotype, we need to determine whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For example, for the C locus:\n\n- If an individual has at least one C allele, they are red (dominant).\n- Only those with two recessive C alleles (cc) are plain.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- Dominant B means brown.\n- Only bb results in checkered.\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypes, we'll look at each gene's effect and combine them. Let's go through each F2 genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Both dominant, so red and brown \u2192 Checkered red.\n2. **CC Bb**: C dominant (so red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n3. **CC bb**: C dominant (red), b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain red.\n4. **Cc BB**: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n5. **Cc Bb**: C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown.\n6. **Cc bb**: C dominant (red), b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain red.\n7. **cc BB**: Both recessive, so plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n8. **cc Bb**: Both recessive, so plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown.\n9. **cc bb**: Both recessive, so plain and checkered \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So any presence of a dominant allele will express the corresponding trait. So for the C locus, any presence of C (either dominant or recessive) will result in red color, unless both alleles are recessive (cc), resulting in plain. Similarly for the B locus.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypes would be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's re-examine each F2 genotype:\n\n1. **CC BB** \u2192 C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered red.\n2. **CC Bb** \u2192 C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown.\n3. **CC bb** \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain red.\n4. **Cc BB** \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown.\n5. **Cc Bb** \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Checkered brown.\n6. **Cc bb** \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain red.\n7. **cc BB** \u2192 c and B dominant \u2192 Plain brown.\n8. **cc Bb** \u2192 c and B dominant \u2192 Plain brown.\n9. **cc bb** \u2192 c and b recessive \u2192 Plain checkered.\n\nSo, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered red (CR)**: Cases where both genes are dominant \u2192 1 case (CC BB)\n- **Checkered brown (CB)**: Cases where C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Cases 2,4,5, which are three cases?\nWait, no, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- CR occurs in CC BB \u2192 1\n- CB occurs in CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 3 cases\n- Cb occurs in CC bb, cC BB, cC Bb \u2192 but wait, does cB appear?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all nine F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 CR\n2. CC Bb \u2192 CB\n3. CC bb \u2192 Cb (Plain red)\n4. cC BB \u2192 CB\n5. cC Bb \u2192 CB\n6. cC bb \u2192 Cb (Plain red)\n7. cc BB \u2192 cb (Plain brown)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 cb (Plain brown)\n9. cc bb \u2192 cb (Plain checkered)\n\nSo now, count:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: cases 2,4,5 \u2192 3\n- Cb: cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- cb: cases 7,8,9 \u2192 3\n\nWait, but hold on. In the original options, I see options like A, B, etc., which include counts like 6,2, etc. So I must have miscounted. Let me make a table:\n\nF2 Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered red (CR)\nCC Bb | Checkered brown (CB)\nCC bb | Plain red (Cb)\nCc BB | Checkered brown (CB)\nCc Bb | Checkered brown (CB)\nCc bb | Plain red (Cb)\ncc BB | Plain brown (cb)\ncc Bb | Plain brown (cb)\ncc bb | Plain checkered (Cb)\n\nNow, how many of each phenotype:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: 3 (cases 2,4,5)\n- Cb: 2 (cases 3,6)\n- cb: 3 (cases7,8,9)\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought there were 9 cases, but according to this table, CR is 1, CB is 3, Cb is 2, and cb is 3. That adds up to 9.\n\nBut none of the options given seem to match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\nE. 3,9,1,3\nF. 4,4,4,4\nG. 12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nHmm, none of these seem to match my current count of 1 CR, 3 CB, 2 Cb, 3 cb. This suggests I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Maybe I misunderstood the dominance rules.\n\nLet me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. For each gene, the presence of a dominant allele overrides the recessive one. So for the C locus, any C allele makes the bird red, regardless of whether it's dominant or recessive. Similarly for the B locus, any B allele makes it brown, regardless of whether it's dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, but in the F2 calculations, I considered the dominance of each allele independently. However, in reality, the presence of even one dominant allele in a gene results in the respective trait being expressed. So, for example, in the C locus, if a bird has at least one C allele (either C or c), it expresses red color, regardless of whether it's C (dominant) or cc (recessive).\n\nBut in the F2 calculation, the genotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. So, for each gene, we need to determine if the dominant allele is present. Let's redo the phenotype determination based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nEach F2 genotype can be categorized into the following categories:\n\n1. Both genes have dominant alleles (C and B): Checkered red (CR)\n2. One gene has a dominant allele, the other doesn't: Checkered brown (CB)\n3. Neither gene has a dominant allele (both recessive): Plain red (Cr) and checkered (Cb) combined? Wait, no. Wait, if neither gene has a dominant allele, then both are recessive, so C and B are recessive, making it plain. And also, since both are recessive, the other gene would have to be checked. Wait, no, both genes have recessive alleles, so the bird is plain and also has no dominant traits. Hmm, but in reality, a bird that is pure recessive for both genes (cc bb) would be plain (for C) and plain (for B), but wait, no\u2014that's not right. Because the presence of a dominant allele in either gene leads to the respective trait. So a bird that is cc bb (both recessive) would have both traits expressed as recessive, meaning it would be plain (no C or B dominant) and also plain (no checkered for B). Wait, but in reality, a bird that is cc bb would be plain (no C) and plain (no B), so it's plain. Similarly, a bird that is CC bb would be red (from C) and plain (from B), so it's plain red. A bird that is CC BB would be red (from C) and brown (from B), so it's checkered brown. A bird that is Cc BB would be red (from C) and brown (from B), so checkered brown. A bird that is Cc Bb would be red and brown, so checkered brown. A bird that is Cc bb would be red and plain, so plain red. A bird that is cc BB would be plain and brown, so plain brown. A bird that is cc Bb would be plain and brown, so plain brown. A bird that is cc bb would be plain and plain, so plain checkered.\n\nWait, so applying this logic:\n\n- CR: CC BB \u2192 red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CB: CC Bb \u2192 same as CR \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cb: CC bb \u2192 red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 plain red\n- CB: Cc BB \u2192 same as above \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CB: Cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cb: Cc bb \u2192 red (C) and plain (b) \u2192 plain red\n- cb: cc BB \u2192 plain (C) and brown (B) \u2192 plain brown\n- cb: cc Bb \u2192 same \u2192 plain brown\n- cb: cc bb \u2192 plain (C) and plain (B) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- CR: 1\n- CB: 3 (cases 2,4,5)\n- Cb: 2 (cases 3,6)\n- cb: 3 (cases7,8,9)\n\nThis sums up to 9, which matches our previous total.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which isn't matching our counts. Option H says \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\", which also doesn't match. Option J says \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\u2014again, not matching. Option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\u2014this doesn't add up to 9 birds, as per our count. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\u2014also doesn't add up. Option F is \"4,4,4,4\"\u2014nope. Option C is \"9,3,3,1\"\u2014which aligns with our counts except for the order.\n\nWait, the options are listed as:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nOur count was 1 CR, 3 CB, 2 Cb, 3 cb. None of the options exactly match this. The closest is option C, which states Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This doesn't match our numbers. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the F2 generation is being calculated incorrectly. Let me try another approach by using a Punnett square for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross. The F1 is CcBb. So the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio if considering each gene separately, but since the genes are linked, the actual ratio depends on their recombination frequency. However, the problem doesn't provide any recombination data, implying that the genes assort independently.\n\nAssuming independence, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for dominance. Let's compute the phenotypes accordingly.\n\nEach F2 genotype contributes to the next generation based on their fitness, but since we're dealing with phenotypic ratios, we can ignore fitness values and focus on the relative occurrence of each genotype.\n\nUsing the formula for independent assortment:\n\nProportions for each genotype are:\n\n- CC BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- cC BB: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cC Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cC bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- cc BB: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc Bb: (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8 \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, converting these fractions to percentages:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16 = 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 3*(1/8) = 37.5%\n- Plain red: 2*(1/16) = 12.5%\n- Plain brown: 2*(1/8) = 25%\n- Plain checkered: 1/16 = 6.25%\n\nBut the options don't reflect decimal percentages. Instead, they give whole numbers. So rounding to the nearest whole number:\n\n- Checkered red: 6%\n- Checkered brown: 37.5% \u2248 38% \u2192 But in the options, the highest is 9, so this approach may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented without considering exact percentages but rather the sum of certain groups.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes, ignoring the dominance hierarchy beyond what's already done. Let me proceed with that.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of the 9 possible genotypes has a different probability. As calculated earlier, the probabilities are:\n\n- CR: 1/16 \u2192 6.25% \u2192 1 bird\n- CB: 3/16 \u2192 ~18.75% \u2192 3 birds\n- Cb: 2/16 \u2192 12.5% \u2192 2 birds\n- cb: 3/16 \u2192 ~18.75% \u2192 3 birds\n\nAdding up to 9 birds.\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n- CR: 1 bird (Checkered red)\n- CB: 3 birds (Checkered brown)\n- Cb: 2 birds (Plain red)\n- cb: 3 birds (Plain red)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 3 : 2 : 3.\n\nLooking at the options, this corresponds to option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, no, that's not matching. Option J says 2:6:3:1, which doesn't fit. Option C has 9:3:3:1, which is similar but the numbers don't match. Option G has 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which doesn't match either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the F2 generation. Let me double-check the Punnett square for the dihybrid cross. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 should be generated by squaring this, resulting in 9 possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (50%)\n3",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering the parents are homozygous, the actual segregation might differ.",
    "rollout": " However, considering the parents are homozygous, the actual segregation might differ. Alternatively, maybe I should use the Punnett square approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again. The F1 would be CcBb, and when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance and recessiveness, let's determine the phenotypes:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: dominant (red)\n- c: recessive (plain)\n- B: dominant (brown)\n- b: recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, any bird with at least one dominant allele for both C and B will have the dominant phenotype. Specifically:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- Dominant C and recessive B \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Recessive C (c) and dominant B \u2192 Plain brown\n- Recessive C and recessive B \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, the F2 generation is composed of four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (dominant for both)\n2. Cc (dominant for C, recessive for c)\n3. cc (recessive for C, dominant for c)\n4. bb (dominant for B, recessive for b)\n\nLet me map each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC: Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: C present (so red), B absent (so brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc: Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain red\n- bb: Both c and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution would depend on how many of each genotype occurs in the F2.\n\nNow, looking at the options given (A to J):\n\nOption D says Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that seems off because if there are four phenotypes, the sum should add up to the total number of F2 individuals. Let me calculate the expected counts.\n\nEach F2 individual is produced by a cross where each gene segregates independently. Since the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the segregation for each gene is independent.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of each outcome is:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are assorting independently, the combined probabilities for each combination are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nTo get the phenotypic distribution, we need to consider all possible combinations of C and B alleles.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether the bird is dominant for both C and B (Checkered red) or dominant for either but not both.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B, it will display the dominant phenotype.\n- Otherwise, it won't.\n\nSo, the dominant phenotype is:\n\n- C (for C) and B (for B): Checkered red\n- C and b: Checkered brown\n- c and B: Plain brown\n- c and b: Plain red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic categories are based on having at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nNow, to count the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\n- All birds without at least one dominant allele for both genes (i.e., cc and bb) will be plain.\n\nSo, let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 (assuming F2 has 16 individuals).\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Checkered red: Occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele for C and B. This includes:\n\n   - CcBb (both dominant)\n   - CcBb (but also when B is present)\n   Wait, perhaps better to compute using the Punnett square approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nSince each gene segregates independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nWait, no. Because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the presence in another gene. So, the probability that a bird is Checkered red is the probability that it has at least one dominant allele for C AND at least one dominant allele for B.\n\nSimilarly, the probability for Checkered brown is the probability of having at least one dominant allele for C OR at least one dominant allele for B, but not necessarily both.\n\nWait, no. Actually, Checkered red is defined by having at least one dominant allele for both C and B. Checkered brown is when at least one dominant allele for C is present, regardless of B. Similarly, plain brown is when at least one dominant allele for B is present, regardless of C. Plain red is when neither C nor B is present.\n\nSo, let's model this:\n\n- Probability of Checkered red (RR) = Probability of at least one C and at least one B\n- Probability of Checkered brown (RB) = Probability of at least one C\n- Probability of plain brown (PB) = Probability of at least one B\n- Probability of plain red (PR) = Probability of neither C nor B\n\nUsing independent assortment:\n\nProbability(at least one C) = 1 - probability(no C) = 1 - (probability(c) * probability(c)) = 1 - (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.75\nSimilarly, probability(at least one B) = 0.75\n\nProbability(at least one C and at least one B) = probability(at least one C) * probability(at least one B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because in reality, the events are not independent in terms of the actual alleles. Instead, we should compute the probabilities directly.\n\nAlternatively, let's list all possible combinations for each gene and see what phenotype each contributes.\n\nGene C: C (dominant) or c (recessive)\nGene B: B (dominant) or b (recessive)\n\nPossible genotypes for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: CC, Cc, cc\n- Gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach combination is equally likely due to independent assortment.\n\nThere are 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations. Let's list them along with their phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2, 4, 5, 8 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the phenotypic ratio was different. Hmm, now according to this, Checkered red is 2/16=1/8, Checkered brown 4/16=1/4, Plain red 2/16=1/8, Plain brown 1/16. That adds up to 10/16, missing something. Oh, wait, I missed some cases.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nCases 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,7 \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,4,5,9 \u2192 4\n- Plain red: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: Case 8 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 2+4+2+1=9. Wait, that sums to 9, but there are 16 cases. So where's the third?\n\nAh, no. Cases 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown. So total phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nTotal: 9, but that contradicts the fact that 16 should be accounted for. Wait, did I miscount? Let me list all nine cases:\n\n1. Checkered red\n2. Checkered brown\n3. Plain red\n4. Checkered brown\n5. Checkered brown\n6. Plain red\n7. Plain red\n8. Plain brown\n9. Checkered brown\n\nThat's 9 phenotypes, leaving 7 unaccounted. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in listing. Let me go through each case again:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red \u2705\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown \u2705\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain red \u2705\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown \u2705\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown \u2705\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Plain red \u2705\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red \u2705\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown \u2705\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown \u2705\n\nYes, that's nine cases. Where are the others? Cases 10-16 don't exist because our Punnett square is limited to these nine possibilities. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed. Another way is to realize that the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering the probabilities of each trait separately and then combining them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds without at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nSo, the probability of being Checkered red is the probability of having at least one dominant allele for both C and B.\n\nWhich is calculated as:\n\nP(C) = 3/4 (since probability of C is 3/4)\nP(B) = 3/4\nP(Both) = P(C) * P(B) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(At least one C) = 3/4\nP(At least one B) = 3/4\n\nBut since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of having at least one C and at least one B is indeed (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nThus, the number of Checkered red birds is 9/16 of the population, approximately 10.625 in 16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one C or at least one B is:\n\nP(at least one C) + P(at least one B) - P(at least one C and at least one B) = 3/4 + 3/4 - 9/16 = 6/4 - 9/16 = 24/16 - 9/16 = 15/16\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total probability cannot exceed 1. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the phenotypic ratio can be found by counting the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nFrom the Punnett square above, checking each case:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: 4 cases\n- Plain red: 2 cases\n- Plain brown: 1 case\n\nThis totals 9 cases, leaving 7 unaccounted. That suggests that perhaps the initial approach is incomplete, and instead, we should look at the phenotypic ratio based on the actual genotypes rather than the simplified cases.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the phenotypes correspond to specific genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CcBb\n- Checkered brown: CcBb (no, wait\u2014C is present, so it's Checkered brown. Also, B is present? Wait, no. CcBb would mean both C and B are present, so it's Checkered red. Wait, confusion arises.\n\nWait, no. For the bird to be Checkered red, it must have at least one dominant allele for both C and B. So:\n\n- C is dominant, B is dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nIn a sample of 16 birds:\n\nNumber of Checkered red birds = Number of birds with at least one C and at least one B\n= Total birds - (number without C) - (number without B) + (number without both C and B)\n= 16 - 4 - 4 + 1 = 9\n\nBecause without C: 4 (cc)\nWithout B: 4 (BB)\nWithout both: 1 (cc BB)\n\nSo, 16 - 4 - 4 + 1 = 9 birds with at least one C and one B.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNumber of Checkered brown = number of birds with at least one C, regardless of B\n= 16 - (number without C) = 16 - 4 = 12\n\nNumber of plain brown = number of birds with at least one B, regardless of C\n= 16 - (number without B) = 16 - 4 = 12\n\nNumber of plain red = number of birds with neither C nor B\n= 16 - (number without C + number without B - number without both C and B)\n= 16 - (4 + 4 - 1) = 16 - 7 = 9\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 9 + 12 + 12 + 9 = 42, which exceeds 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternative approach: Use a table to list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered red\nCC Bb | Checkered brown\nCC bb | Plain red\nCc BB | Checkered brown\nCc Bb | Checkered brown\nCc bb | Plain red\ncc BB | Plain red\ncc Bb | Plain brown\ncc bb | Checkered brown\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1), CcBb (1) \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb (1), Cc BB (1), Cc Bb (1) \u2192 3\n- Plain red: CC bb (1), Cc bb (1), cc BB (1) \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: cc Bb (1), cc bb (1) \u2192 2\n\nWait, adding these up: 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 10, which still doesn't add up to 16.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some cases.\n\nWait, no. Cases 1-9 cover all possibilities, so perhaps the error lies elsewhere.

Let me refer back to the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0\n\nThat can't be right because we have 16 birds, and this option sums to 16.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6\n\nNo, because 5+3+2+6=16, but the numbers don't align with our previous counts.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, Checkered brown 5, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\n\nAgain, summing to 16, but the numbers don't match.\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2\n\nSum to 16.\n\nOption B: Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, Plain red 0, Plain brown 4\n\nSum to 16.\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1\n\nSum to 16.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3\n\nSum to 16.\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match the correct counts unless I'm misunderstanding the scenario.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the parents are homozygous, the actual segregation might differ. Alternatively, maybe I should use the Punnett square approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again. The F1 would be CcBb, and when it selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance and recessiveness, let's determine the phenotypes:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: dominant (red)\n- c: recessive (plain)\n- B: dominant (brown)\n- b: recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, any bird with at least one dominant allele for both C and B will have the dominant phenotype. Specifically:\n\n- Dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Checkered red (since C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- Dominant C and recessive B \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Recessive C (c) and dominant B \u2192 Plain brown\n- Recessive C and recessive B \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, the F2 generation is composed of four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (dominant for both)\n2. Cc (dominant for C, recessive for c)\n3. cc (recessive for C, dominant for c)\n4. bb (dominant for B, recessive for b)\n\nLet me map each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC: Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: C present (so red), B absent (so brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc: Neither C nor B \u2192 Plain red\n- bb: Both c and b \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution would depend on how many of each genotype occurs in the F2.\n\nNow, looking at the options given (A to J):\n\nOption D says Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that seems off because if there are four phenotypes, the sum should add up to the total number of F2 individuals. Let me calculate the expected counts.\n\nEach F2 individual is produced by a cross where each gene segregates independently. Since the parents are CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the segregation for each gene is independent.\n\nFor each gene, the probability of each outcome is:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are assorting independently, the combined probabilities for each combination are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nTo get the phenotypic distribution, we need to consider all possible combinations of C and B alleles.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether the bird is dominant for both C and B (Checkered red) or dominant for either but not both.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B, it will display the dominant phenotype.\n- Otherwise, it won't.\n\nSo, the dominant phenotype is:\n\n- C (for C) and B (for B): Checkered red\n- C and b: Checkered brown\n- c and B: Plain brown\n- c and b: Plain red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic categories are based on having at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nNow, to count the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\n- All birds without at least one dominant allele for both genes (i.e., cc and bb) will be plain.\n\nSo, let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 (assuming F2 has 16 individuals).\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Checkered red: Occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele for C and B. This includes:\n\n   - CcBb (both dominant)\n   - CcBb (but also when B is present)\n   Wait, perhaps better to compute using the Punnett square approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nSince each gene segregates independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nWait, no. Because the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the presence in another gene. So, the probability that a bird is Checkered red is the probability that it has at least one dominant allele for C AND at least one dominant allele for B.\n\nSimilarly, the probability for Checkered brown is the probability of having at least one dominant allele for C OR at least one dominant allele for B, but not necessarily both.\n\nWait, no. Actually, Checkered red is defined by having at least one dominant allele for both C and B. Checkered brown is when at least one dominant allele for C is present, regardless of B. Similarly, plain brown is when at least one dominant allele for B is present, regardless of C. Plain red is when neither C nor B is present.\n\nSo, let's model this:\n\n- Probability of Checkered red (RR) = Probability of at least one C and at least one B\n- Probability of Checkered brown (RB) = Probability of at least one C\n- Probability of plain brown (PB) = Probability of at least one B\n- Probability of plain red (PR) = Probability of neither C nor B\n\nUsing independent assortment:\n\nProbability(at least one C) = 1 - probability(no C) = 1 - (probability(c) * probability(c)) = 1 - (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.75\nSimilarly, probability(at least one B) = 0.75\n\nProbability(at least one C and at least one B) = probability(at least one C) * probability(at least one B) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Because in reality, the events are not independent in terms of the actual alleles. Instead, we should compute the probabilities directly.\n\nAlternatively, let's list all possible combinations for each gene and see what phenotype each contributes.\n\nGene C: C (dominant) or c (recessive)\nGene B: B (dominant) or b (recessive)\n\nPossible genotypes for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: CC, Cc, cc\n- Gene B: BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach combination is equally likely due to independent assortment.\n\nThere are 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations. Let's list them along with their phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain red\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1, 7 \u2192 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2, 4, 5, 8 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain red: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain brown: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the phenotypic ratio was different. Hmm, now according to this, Checkered red is 2/16=1/8, Checkered brown 4/16=1/4, Plain red 2/16=1/8, Plain brown 1/16. That adds up to 10/16, missing something. Oh, wait, I missed some cases.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nCases 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Plain red\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: Cases 1,7 \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: Cases 2,4,5,9 \u2192 4\n- Plain red: Cases 3,6 \u2192 2\n- Plain brown: Case 8 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 2+4+2+1=9. Wait, that sums to 9, but there are 16 cases. So where's the third?\n\nAh, no. Cases 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown. So total phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 2\n- Checkered brown: 4\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nTotal: 9, but that contradicts the fact that 16 should be accounted for. Wait, did I miscount? Let me list all nine cases:\n\n1. Checkered red\n2. Checkered brown\n3. Plain red\n4. Checkered brown\n5. Checkered brown\n6. Plain red\n7. Plain red\n8. Plain brown\n9. Checkered brown\n\nThat's 9 phenotypes, leaving 7 unaccounted. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in listing. Let me go through each case again:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered red \u2705\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown \u2705\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Plain red \u2705\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown \u2705\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown \u2705\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Plain red \u2705\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red \u2705\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown \u2705\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown \u2705\n\nYes, that's nine cases. Where are the others? Cases 10-16 don't exist because our Punnett square is limited to these nine possibilities. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed. Another way is to realize that the phenotypic ratio can be calculated by considering the probabilities of each trait separately and then combining them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds without at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nSo, the probability of being Checkered red is the probability of having at least one dominant allele for both C and B.\n\nWhich is calculated as:\n\nP(C) = 3/4 (since probability of C is 3/4)\nP(B) = 3/4\nP(Both) = P(C) * P(B) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(At least one C) = 3/4\nP(At least one B) = 3/4\n\nBut since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of having at least one C and at least one B is indeed (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nThus, the number of Checkered red birds is 9/16 of the population, approximately 10.625 in 16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one C or at least one B is:\n\nP(at least one C) + P(at least one B) - P(at least one C and at least one B) = 3/4 + 3/4 - 9/16 = 6/4 - 9/16 = 24/16 - 9/16 = 15/16\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total probability cannot exceed 1. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the phenotypic ratio can be found by counting the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nFrom the Punnett square above, checking each case:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 cases\n- Checkered brown: 4 cases\n- Plain red: 2 cases\n- Plain brown: 1 case\n\nThis totals 9 cases, leaving 7 unaccounted. That suggests that perhaps the initial approach is incomplete, and instead, we should look at the phenotypic ratio based on the actual genotypes rather than the simplified cases.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the phenotypes correspond to specific genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CcBb\n- Checkered brown: CcBb (no, wait\u2014C is present, so it's Checkered brown. Also, B is present? Wait, no. CcBb would mean both C and B are present, so it's Checkered red. Wait, confusion arises.\n\nWait, no. For the bird to be Checkered red, it must have at least one dominant allele for both C and B. So:\n\n- C is dominant, B is dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c dominant, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n- c dominant, B recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the number of each phenotype is determined by the number of birds with at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nIn a sample of 16 birds:\n\nNumber of Checkered red birds = Number of birds with at least one C and at least one B\n= Total birds - (number without C) - (number without B) + (number without both C and B)\n= 16 - 4 - 4 + 1 = 9\n\nBecause without C: 4 (cc)\nWithout B: 4 (BB)\nWithout both: 1 (cc BB)\n\nSo, 16 - 4 - 4 + 1 = 9 birds with at least one C and one B.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNumber of Checkered brown = number of birds with at least one C, regardless of B\n= 16 - (number without C) = 16 - 4 = 12\n\nNumber of plain brown = number of birds with at least one B, regardless of C\n= 16 - (number without B) = 16 - 4 = 12\n\nNumber of plain red = number of birds with neither C nor B\n= 16 - (number without C + number without B - number without both C and B)\n= 16 - (4 + 4 - 1) = 16 - 7 = 9\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 9 + 12 + 12 + 9 = 42, which exceeds 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternative approach: Use a table to list all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC BB | Checkered red\nCC Bb | Checkered brown\nCC bb | Plain red\nCc BB | Checkered brown\nCc Bb | Checkered brown\nCc bb | Plain red\ncc BB | Plain red\ncc Bb | Plain brown\ncc bb | Checkered brown\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (1), CcBb (1) \u2192 2\n- Checkered brown: CC Bb (1), Cc BB (1), Cc Bb (1) \u2192 3\n- Plain red: CC bb (1), Cc bb (1), cc BB (1) \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: cc Bb (1), cc bb (1) \u2192 2\n\nWait, adding these up: 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 10, which still doesn't add up to 16.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some cases.\n\nWait, no. Cases 1-9 cover all possibilities, so perhaps the error lies elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the phenotypic ratios is incorrect. Let me refer back to the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0\n\nThat can't be right because we have 16 birds, and this option sums to 16.\n\nOption H: Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6\n\nNo, because 5+3+2+6=16, but the numbers don't align with our previous counts.\n\nOption I: Checkered red 7, Checkered brown 5, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\n\nAgain, summing to 16, but the numbers don't match.\n\nOption A: Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2\n\nSum to 16.\n\nOption B: Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, Plain red 0, Plain brown 4\n\nSum to 16.\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1\n\nSum to 16.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3\n\nSum to 16.\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match the correct counts unless I'm misunderstanding the scenario.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, the actual F2 genotypes depend on whether the alleles assort independently. In this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio if both genes are independent. But the question asks specifically about the phenotypic ratio after considering the effects of the genes. So, moving forward.\n\nThe next part is determining the phenotypes based on the given genes:\n\n- Pigmentation (B/b):\n  - B = dominant \u2192 Brown\n  - b = recessive \u2192 Checkered\n  \n- Color (C/c):\n  - C = dominant \u2192 Red\n  - c = recessive \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, each bird has two alleles for each gene. For example, a bird could be BB (both B), Bb (one B and one b), bB (same as Bb), or bb (both b). Similarly for color: CC (both C), Cc (one C and one c), cc (both c).\n\nNow, the phenotype depends on both genes. If a bird is B (brown) and C (red), then it would have brown-red coloration. But the exact interaction isn't specified beyond dominance. Assuming additive effects, a bird with at least one dominant allele for both traits would express those traits. Alternatively, it might simply mean that any dominant allele in either trait results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps the question is simpler, expecting us to consider each trait separately and combine their effects. Let me proceed under the assumption that each gene's expression is independent, and the presence of dominant alleles for either gene results in the respective phenotype.\n\nWait, but the question says \"phenotypic ratio,\" implying that the combination of both traits matters. So, we'll need to determine the frequency of each combination of traits in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that the parents are homozygous, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio if the genes assort independently. However, since the question provides specific options, perhaps some of these combinations are not viable or don't occur due to epistasis or other genetic interactions.\n\nLet me try to list all possible genotypes for the F2 generation:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (dominant for both genes): Phenotype: Brown and Red \u2192 Brown Red\n2. Cc (dominant for C, recessive for B): Brown and Plain \u2192 Brown Plain\n3. cc (recessive for both genes): Checkered and Plain \u2192 Checkered Plain\n4. bb (recessive for B, recessive for C): Checkered and Red \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nNow, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- Brown (B) overrides checkered (b).\n- Red (C) overrides plain (c).\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CC: Both B and C are present \u2192 Brown Red\n2. Cc: Only B is present \u2192 Brown Plain\n3. cc: Only b is present \u2192 Checkered\n4. bb: Only c is present \u2192 Checkered Red\n\nNext, we calculate the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. Since the parents are homozygous and the F1 is heterozygous, the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio if the two genes assort independently.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Brown Red: 9/16\n- Brown Plain: 3/16\n- Checkered: 3/16\n- Checkered Red: 1/16\n\nWait, but this doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions A through H provide different phenotypic ratios. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16. That seems plausible. Let me see how that comes into play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the combined effect of both genes, such as dominance interactions, leading to fewer phenotypic classes. For instance, if having at least one dominant allele for either trait results in a particular phenotype, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype, regardless of the other gene. So, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (B or B) and at least one dominant allele for color (C or C) would have Brown and Red. Otherwise, it would take the lower phenotype.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Brown and Red: All genotypes except when bb or cc.\n- Brown and Plain: Genotypes where B is present but b is present (i.e., Bb and Bb).\n- Checkered: Either bb or cc (or both).\n- Checkered and Red: Genotypes where c is present but B is present (i.e., Bb and Cc).\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nTotal phenotypic classes would be 4: Brown Red, Brown Plain, Checkered, Checkered Red.\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each class:\n\n1. Brown Red: All genotypes except when both B and b are absent and both C and c are absent. From the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the probability of Brown Red is 9/16.\n\n2. Brown Plain: This occurs when B is present but b is present. From the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the probability of Brown Plain is 3/16.\n\n3. Checkered: This occurs when b is present (from cc) or when both B and b are present (but that's covered in Brown Red and Brown Plain). Wait, no. Checkered would include both cc and Bb (since Bb has B but not b, so it's brown, but the phenotype is checkered because of the absence of red). Wait, confusion arises here. Let me clarify:\n\nCheckered phenotype happens when at least one allele is recessive for both color and pigment. That is, when the bird is either:\n\n- Checkered and Red: Genotype cc (for color) and Bb (for pigment)? Wait, no. Checkered phenotype requires the bird to have at least one recessive allele for both color and pigment. So, a bird would be checkered if it has both alleles recessive for pigment and at least one recessive for color.\n\nWait, no. The definition is that checkered is when the bird has the recessive alleles for both color and pigment. So, any bird that is cc (color) and Bb (pigment) would be checkered? Wait, no\u2014if a bird is Bb and cc, then it's cc for color and Bb for pigment, meaning both recessive alleles for pigment and at least one recessive for color. Thus, it would be checkered. Similarly, if a bird is cc and Bb, it's also checkered. But if a bird is bb (color) and Bb (pigment), it's brown and red, so not checkered.\n\nThus, checkered phenotype occurs in:\n\n- Genotypes where color is recessive (cc) and pigment is recessive (bb): but that's only the genotype bb (which would be black), wait, no. Wait, color is determined by B and b. Checkered is when both B and b are recessive. So, color is checkered when both B and b are recessive. Pigment is checkered when both C and c are recessive.\n\nThus, checkered is when a bird is bb (for color) and cc (for pigment), i.e., genotype cc bb. Additionally, any bird that is Bb (pigment) and cc (color) would also be checkered. Wait, no. If a bird is Bb (pigment) and cc (color), it's still checkered because both alleles are recessive for both traits. So, the checkered phenotype includes:\n\n- bb cc\n- Bb cc\n- bb Bb (wait, no, that's Bb, which is brown, and cc, which is colorless. So, Bb cc would be brown and checkered.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The checkered phenotype occurs when the bird is recessive for both color and pigment. So, the only way a bird is checkered is if both B and b are recessive (so Bb becomes bb) and both C and c are recessive (so Cc becomes cc). Thus, the only genotype leading to checkered is cc bb.\n\nAdditionally, any bird that is Bb (pigment) and cc (color) would also be checkered because they have both alleles recessive for color and one recessive for pigment. Wait, no. If a bird is Bb (pigment) and cc (color), it's still checkered because both B and b are recessive for pigment, and both C and c are recessive for color. So, regardless of whether the bird has B or not, as long as both are recessive, it's checkered.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nEach bird can be classified into one of four phenotypes based on the dominance of their alleles:\n\n1. Brown and Red (B and C dominant)\n2. Brown and Plain (B dominant, c for pigment)\n3. Checkered (both alleles recessive for both traits)\n4. Checkered and Red (only c for pigment, B dominant)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Brown and Red: All birds that have at least one B and at least one C. From the 9:3:3:1, this is 9/16.\n\n- Brown and Plain: Birds that have B but not b. This is 3/16.\n\n- Checkered: Birds that have neither B nor C (i.e., both alleles recessive). This is 1/16.\n\n- Checkered and Red: Birds that have c but not b. This is 3/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 16, which makes sense.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, option G states: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which corresponds to our calculation:\n\n- Checkered and Red: 9\n- Checkered and Brown: 3\n- Brown and Red: 9\n- Brown and Plain: 3\n\nThis matches option G.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Looking at the options, option J is: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option G fits perfectly.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. The 9:3:3:1 ratio sums to 16, so dividing each by 16 gives the probabilities per phenotype:\n\n- Brown Red: 9/16\n- Brown Plain: 3/16\n- Checkered: 1/16\n- Checkered Red: 3/16\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 9:3:1:3. But none of the options directly say that. Instead, option G is 9:3:3:1, which is the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio without splitting into sub-ratios like brown-red vs brown-white. But according to my earlier analysis, the phenotypes are grouped as Brown Red, Brown Plain, Checkered, and Checkered Red, with counts 9, 3, 1, 3 respectively. So option G is the correct answer.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G is indeed the one that states the ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our calculations exactly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Wait, no. If a bird is Bb (pigment) and cc (color), it's still checkered because both B and b are recessive for pigment, and both C and c are recessive for color. So, regardless of whether the bird has B or not, as long as both are recessive, it's checkered.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nEach bird can be classified into one of four phenotypes based on the dominance of their alleles:\n\n1. Brown and Red (B and C dominant)\n2. Brown and Plain (B dominant, c for pigment)\n3. Checkered (both alleles recessive for both traits)\n4. Checkered and Red (only c for pigment, B dominant)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Brown and Red: All birds that have at least one B and at least one C. From the 9:3:3:1, this is 9/16.\n\n- Brown and Plain: Birds that have B but not b. This is 3/16.\n\n- Checkered: Birds that have neither B nor C (i.e., both alleles recessive). This is 1/16.\n\n- Checkered and Red: Birds that have c but not b. This is 3/16.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 16, which makes sense.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided, option G states: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which corresponds to our calculation:\n\n- Checkered and Red: 9\n- Checkered and Brown: 3\n- Brown and Red: 9\n- Brown and Plain: 3\n\nThis matches option G.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Looking at the options, option J is: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with our calculation. Option G fits perfectly.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. The 9:3:3:1 ratio sums to 16, so dividing each by 16 gives the probabilities per phenotype:\n\n- Brown Red: 9/16\n- Brown Plain: 3/16\n- Checkered: 1/16\n- Checkered Red: 3/16\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 9:3:1:3. But none of the options directly say that. Instead, option G is 9:3:3:1, which is the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio without splitting into sub-ratios like brown-red vs brown-white. But according to my earlier analysis, the phenotypes are grouped as Brown Red, Brown Plain, Checkered, and Checkered Red, with counts 9, 3, 1, 3 respectively. So option G is the correct answer.\n\nLooking at the options again, option G is indeed the one that states the ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our calculations exactly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, in reality, if both parents are heterozygous for both genes, then the F2 will have independent assortment, leading to 9/16 CC, 3/16 Cc, 3/16 cc, and 1/16 bb.",
    "rollout": " However, in reality, if both parents are heterozygous for both genes, then the F2 will have independent assortment, leading to 9/16 CC, 3/16 Cc, 3/16 cc, and 1/16 bb. But in this case, the parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another. Wait, no\u2014both parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for the other. Wait, no, both parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for the other. For example, Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for C and B), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for c and b). So when they cross, all F1 will be CcBb, and their gametes will be CB and cb in equal proportion. So the F2 will have four possibilities:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you have two parents who are both homozygous, their F1 would all be the same, and their F2 would follow a certain distribution.\n\nBut according to the user's given options, the answer seems to be different. They've provided multiple choices for the phenotypic ratio. Let me look back at the problem statement to make sure I understood everything correctly.\n\nThe problem states that the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). So their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be determined by selfing F1. The F2 genotypes would include CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles for both genes. \n\nNow, considering the dominance relationships:\n\n- For Pigmentation (Gene C):\n  - C (dominant) = Red\n  - c (recessive) = Checkered\n  \n- For Color (Gene B):\n  - B (dominant) = Brown\n  - b (recessive) = Checkered\n  \nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. For example, a bird with CB genotype would have red and brown eyes, resulting in red-brown eyes. Similarly, a bird with Cb would have red and checkered eyes, resulting in red-checkered. A bird with cb would have checkered and checkered, so just checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red-Brown (from CC and BB)\n2. Red-Checkered (from CC and bb)\n3. Checkered-Brown (from cc and BB)\n4. Checkered-Checkered (from cc and bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for two loci, but in terms of phenotypes, some genotypes might lead to the same phenotype. However, considering dominance, we can determine the actual numbers.\n\nFirst, let's list the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nEach of these four genotypes corresponds to a unique phenotype. However, some genotypes may result in the same phenotype due to dominance. For example, if both C and B were dominant, any genotype where either allele is dominant would result in the same phenotype. But in our case:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Dominant C and Dominant B \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Dominant C and Recessive B \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Recessive C and Dominant B \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Recessive C and Recessive B \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nSince each combination leads to a distinct phenotype, there are four phenotypic categories. However, in reality, some might combine, but based on dominance, all four are separate.\n\nTo find the actual counts, we'll consider the probabilities of each genotype in the F2.\n\nWhen crossing F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb):\n\n- The probability of CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Probability of Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- Probability of cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- Probability of BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Probability of Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- Probability of bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for Gene C: C and c, each in equal frequency. For Gene B: B and b, each in equal frequency. Thus, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency in F1. When F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself, the F2 will have the following genotype probabilities:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50% (since CB + cb and cb + CB are both 25% each)\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50% (same reasoning)\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- bb \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nSo, looking at the counts:\n\n- Red-Brown occurs twice (CC and BB) \u2192 2 parts\n- Red-Checkered occurs twice (Cc and Bb) \u2192 2 parts\n- Checkered-Brown occurs once (cc) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered-Checkered occurs once (bb) \u2192 1 part\n\nThus, the total ratio is 2:2:1:1, totaling 6 parts.\n\nBut wait, the sum of probabilities adds up to 100%, so 2+2+1+1=6, which is less than 100%. That suggests I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nActually, the probabilities for each genotype are:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- BB: 25% \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Bb: 50% \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nAdding up: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 + 50 + 25 = 200% \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, converting to phenotypes:\n\n- Red-Brown: CC (25%) + BB (25%) = 50% \u2192 2 parts (since 50% is half of 100, but each part represents a different phenotype)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to count the number of each phenotype directly. Alternatively, the fraction of each phenotype is:\n\n- Red-Brown: (25% + 25%) = 50% \u2192 50/100 \u2192 5 parts\n- Red-Checkered: (50% + 50%) = 100% \u2192 10 parts\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because the fractions add up differently. Let me approach it differently.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n- Red-Brown: Phenotype A \u2192 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 50/100 = 1/2\n- Red-Checkered: Phenotype B \u2192 50% + 50% = 100% \u2192 100/100 = 1\n- Checkered-Brown: Phenotype C \u2192 25% \u2192 25/100\n- Checkered-Checkered: Phenotype D \u2192 25% \u2192 25/100\n\nBut adding them up: 50 + 100 + 25 + 25 = 200 \u2192 Not quite 100%. This indicates a miscalculation. Instead, let's compute the exact percentages based on the squares of the coefficients.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is determined by the squares of the coefficients. For two linked traits, but in this case, the genes are likely independently assorting because each parent is homozygous for one and heterozygous for the other. However, without knowing linkage, we assume independent assortment.\n\nThe F2 cross will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. Let me verify that.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- 9/16 CC BB (Red-Brown)\n- 3/16 CC bb (Red-Checkered)\n- 3/16 cc BB (Checkered-Brown)\n- 1/16 cc bb (Checkered-Checkered)\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts Red-Brown, 3 Red-Checkered, 3 Checkered-Brown, and 1 Checkered-Checkered. Adding up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 Correct.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Translating to counts:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Red-Checkered: 3\n- Checkered-Brown: 3\n- Checkered-Checkered: 1\n\nTotal F2 population: 16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That doesn't match my calculation.\n\nOption G: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2013 No, doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 No.\n\nOption F: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2013 No, that's 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, which isn't the case.\n\nOption I: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 No.\n\nOption C: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 Yes!

However, in reality, if both parents are heterozygous for both genes, then the F2 will have independent assortment, leading to 9/16 CC, 3/16 Cc, 3/16 cc, and 1/16 bb. But in this case, the parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another. Wait, no\u2014both parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for the other. Wait, no, both parents are homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for the other. For example, Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for C and B), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for c and b). So when they cross, all F1 will be CcBb, and their gametes will be CB and cb in equal proportion. So the F2 will have four possibilities:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you have two parents who are both homozygous, their F1 would all be the same, and their F2 would follow a certain distribution.\n\nBut according to the user's given options, the answer seems to be different.

For example, a bird with CB genotype would have red and brown eyes, resulting in red-brown eyes. Similarly, a bird with Cb would have red and checkered eyes, resulting in red-checkered. A bird with cb would have checkered and checkered, so just checkered.\n\nTherefore, the F2 generation would have four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Red-Brown (from CC and BB)\n2.

However, some genotypes may result in the same phenotype due to dominance. For example, if both C and B were dominant, any genotype where either allele is dominant would result in the same phenotype. But in our case:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Dominant C and Dominant B \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Dominant C and Recessive B \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Recessive C and Dominant B \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Recessive C and Recessive B \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nSince each combination leads to a distinct phenotype, there are four phenotypic categories. However, in reality, some might combine, but based on dominance, all four are separate.\n\nTo find the actual counts, we'll consider the probabilities of each genotype in the F2.\n\nWhen crossing F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb):\n\n- The probability of CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Probability of Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- Probability of cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- Probability of BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Probability of Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- Probability of bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for Gene C: C and c, each in equal frequency. For Gene B: B and b, each in equal frequency. Thus, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency in F1. When F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself, the F2 will have the following genotype probabilities:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50% (since CB + cb and cb + CB are both 25% each)\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50% (same reasoning)\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- bb \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nSo, looking at the counts:\n\n- Red-Brown occurs twice (CC and BB) \u2192 2 parts\n- Red-Checkered occurs twice (Cc and Bb) \u2192 2 parts\n- Checkered-Brown occurs once (cc) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered-Checkered occurs once (bb) \u2192 1 part\n\nThus, the total ratio is 2:2:1:1, totaling 6 parts.\n\nBut wait, the sum of probabilities adds up to 100%, so 2+2+1+1=6, which is less than 100%. That suggests I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nActually, the probabilities for each genotype are:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Checkered-Brown\n- BB: 25% \u2192 Red-Brown\n- Bb: 50% \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nAdding up: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 + 50 + 25 = 200% \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, converting to phenotypes:\n\n- Red-Brown: CC (25%) + BB (25%) = 50% \u2192 2 parts (since 50% is half of 100, but each part represents a different phenotype)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to count the number of each phenotype directly. Alternatively, the fraction of each phenotype is:\n\n- Red-Brown: (25% + 25%) = 50% \u2192 50/100 \u2192 5 parts\n- Red-Checkered: (50% + 50%) = 100% \u2192 10 parts\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect because the fractions add up differently. Let me approach it differently.\n\nFor each phenotype:\n\n- Red-Brown: Phenotype A \u2192 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 50/100 = 1/2\n- Red-Checkered: Phenotype B \u2192 50% + 50% = 100% \u2192 100/100 = 1\n- Checkered-Brown: Phenotype C \u2192 25% \u2192 25/100\n- Checkered-Checkered: Phenotype D \u2192 25% \u2192 25/100\n\nBut adding them up: 50 + 100 + 25 + 25 = 200 \u2192 Not quite 100%. This indicates a miscalculation. Instead, let's compute the exact percentages based on the squares of the coefficients.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is determined by the squares of the coefficients. For two linked traits, but in this case, the genes are likely independently assorting because each parent is homozygous for one and heterozygous for the other. However, without knowing linkage, we assume independent assortment.\n\nThe F2 cross will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. Let me verify that.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- 9/16 CC BB (Red-Brown)\n- 3/16 CC bb (Red-Checkered)\n- 3/16 cc BB (Checkered-Brown)\n- 1/16 cc bb (Checkered-Checkered)\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 parts Red-Brown, 3 Red-Checkered, 3 Checkered-Brown, and 1 Checkered-Checkered. Adding up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 Correct.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Translating to counts:\n\n- Red-Brown: 9\n- Red-Checkered: 3\n- Checkered-Brown: 3\n- Checkered-Checkered: 1\n\nTotal F2 population: 16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That doesn't match my calculation.\n\nOption G: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2013 No, doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 No.\n\nOption F: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\" \u2013 No, that's 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, which isn't the case.\n\nOption I: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 No.\n\nOption C: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\" \u2013 Yes! That matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

But since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will only have four possible phenotypes: checkered red (CC BB), checkered brown (CC bb), plain red (cc BB), and plain brown (cc bb). Because C and B are linked? Wait, no\u2014the problem doesn't mention any linkage, so genes C and B are assumed to assort independently. So each gene segregates independently. Thus, the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But the user is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio, considering both genes.

Wait, looking back at the user\u2019s initial description: the parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. The F1 will be CcBb, and then F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nBut the user is asking specifically about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. So, given that both parents are homozygous, the F2 will have only four phenotypes. Let me list them:\n\n1. Checkered red (CC BB): Occurs when both parents contribute C and B. Since the parents are homozygous, this is only possible once, but wait, the F2 can have multiple individuals with this phenotype.

However, the options given don't seem to match exactly. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios, such as 6:2:6:2 for red to brown, etc. So likely, my initial approach isn't matching the options, indicating I might have misunderstood the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F1 itself is being used, but the question specifies F2. Let me re-examine the original question: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the cross is between a homozygous checkered red (let's say CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb.

However, the options provided do not reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, some options have different counts. For example, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, totaling 16.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross is between two different species, leading to a different scenario. But no, the problem states it's an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So, perhaps the correct answer is none of the above, but given the options, I must choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different cross setup, like between a heterozygous bird and another bird, leading to a different F2 distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the cross setup. Let me consider the options again. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, which is 4^2, suggesting that the F2 is actually a diploid cross with each gene having two copies, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the F1 is considered instead of the F2. But the question clearly asks for the F2 generation.\n\nAnother possibility is that the F1 is the parent, and the F2 is produced by selfing the F1, which is correct. So, the F2 would have four phenotypes, each at 25%, but the options don't present that. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the cross setup, or I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the F2 refers to a different kind of cross, such as a dihybrid cross without considering the parental background.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F1 is considered, but the question asks for F2. Let me see the options again. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, adding up to 12. This could come from a different approach, perhaps considering independent assortment differently. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 includes both parents contributing gametes, leading to a total of 16 individuals, with specific counts based on the combination of alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 is formed by selfing the F1, which is already a dihybrid. In that case, the F2 would have the same four phenotypes, each at 25%. But again, the options don't align. Maybe the user intended a different cross setup, such as between a heterozygote and a pure bird, leading to a different F2 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to a cross where the parents are different, such as a bird with Cc and Bb, leading to a dihybrid cross resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled accordingly. Let me try that. If the F1 is CcBb, then F2 would include:\n\n- 25% CC BB (checkered red)\n- 25% CC bb (checkered brown)\n- 25% cc BB (plain red)\n- 25% cc bb (plain brown)\n\nIf the question is referring to the F2 including all four phenotypes equally, then the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but the options suggest otherwise. Perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 instead, but the question says F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 is being asked for a different type of cross, such as between two different species, leading to different allele distributions. But without additional context, it's challenging to proceed.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to note that the F2 for a dihybrid cross typically results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, depending on whether the traits are linked or not, the numbers may vary. Assuming independence, the ratio would be approximately 9 parts red and 3 parts brown, but the exact pheno ratios depend on the dominance hierarchy. Given that, let me look at the options again.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16. This suggests that perhaps the F2 includes only checkered and plain, ignoring the brown and red components. Alternatively, perhaps the user included some miscalculations. Another option, Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, showing a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which resembles a Mendelian dihybrid cross. However, this does not account for the dominance hierarchy, as the sum exceeds the expected 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user incorrectly combined the F1 phenotypes, leading to such ratios. Considering the complexity, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the F2 for a dihybrid cross typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but given the options, none perfectly match. However, perhaps the user intended to refer to a different scenario, such as a monohybrid cross followed by a dihybrid cross. But without further information, I'll have to make a choice based on standard Mendelian inheritance principles.\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, and the ratios are 1:3:9:3, which is similar to a binomial expansion (a+b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2, but scaled. However, this doesn't account for dominance. The correct approach should consider dominance and the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the expected result under standard Mendelian inheritance. However, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is Option D, which sums to 16 and reflects a certain distribution.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

But without additional context, it's challenging to proceed.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to note that the F2 for a dihybrid cross typically results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. However, depending on whether the traits are linked or not, the numbers may vary. Assuming independence, the ratio would be approximately 9 parts red and 3 parts brown, but the exact pheno ratios depend on the dominance hierarchy. Given that, let me look at the options again.\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16. This suggests that perhaps the F2 includes only checkered and plain, ignoring the brown and red components. Alternatively, perhaps the user included some miscalculations. Another option, Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, showing a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which resembles a Mendelian dihybrid cross. However, this does not account for the dominance hierarchy, as the sum exceeds the expected 9+3+3+1=16.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user incorrectly combined the F1 phenotypes, leading to such ratios. Considering the complexity, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the F2 for a dihybrid cross typically follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but given the options, none perfectly match. However, perhaps the user intended to refer to a different scenario, such as a monohybrid cross followed by a dihybrid cross. But without further information, I'll have to make a choice based on standard Mendelian inheritance principles.\n\nLooking at option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, and the ratios are 1:3:9:3, which is similar to a binomial expansion (a+b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2, but scaled. However, this doesn't account for dominance. The correct approach should consider dominance and the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the expected result under standard Mendelian inheritance. However, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is Option D, which sums to 16 and reflects a certain distribution.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, considering the actual genes are independent, we'd expect a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes.\n\nWait, but hold on. Actually, each parent contributes gametes independently. So the F2 will have a distribution where each phenotype occurs according to the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. Alternatively, since each trait is controlled by separate genes, we can model them separately and then combine the results.\n\nLet's tackle each gene separately:\n\n1. Gene C ( pigment color ):\n   - Parent 1 (CC) can only produce C gametes.\n   - Parent 2 (cc) can only produce c gametes.\n   So, F1 (Cc) will produce C and c gametes equally (50% each).\n\n2. Gene B (color):\n   - Parent 1 (BB) can only produce B gametes.\n   - Parent 2 (bb) can only produce b gametes.\n   So, F1 (Bb) will produce B and b gametes equally (50% each).\n\nSince these genes assort independently, the combined F2 will have a 1/4 chance for each combination of C/B traits. Specifically:\n\n- CC (C dominant): Phenotype = Red\n- Cc (C dominant): Phenotype = Red (since c is recessive)\n- cc (c dominant): Phenotype = Plain\n- BB (B dominant): Phenotype = Brown\n- Bb (B dominant): Phenotype = Brown\n- bb (b dominant): Phenotype = Checkered\n\nBut wait, the user's options mention \"red,\" \"brown,\" etc., so let's map this.\n\nThe possible F2 phenotypes are: red, brown, checkered, and plain. But the user's options don't include checkered and plain, only red, brown, etc. Wait, looking back, the user didn't specify that the F2 includes all possible phenotypes, but the problem asks for the F2 phenotypic ratio, along with genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios.\n\nSo, the F2 will have four possible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B:\n\n1. CC (Red): Phenotype = Red\n2. Cc (Red): Phenotype = Red\n3. cc (Plain): Phenotype = Plain\n4. BB (Brown): Phenotype = Brown\n5. Bb (Brown): Phenotype = Brown\n6. bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Checkered\n\nNow, the proportion for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is segregating at a 1:1 ratio, the overall F2 will have four phenotypic categories, each with a certain probability.\n\nFor example, the probability of being Red (either CC or Cc) is (1/2 * 1) + (1/2 * 1) )= 1/2. Similarly, the probability of being Plain (cc) is 1/4. Brown (BB or Bb) is also 1/2, and Checkered (bb) is 1/4.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me calculate more precisely.\n\nEach gene segregates into C/c and B/b with equal probability (50% each). Since the genes are independent, the four possible F2 genotypes each have a 25% chance.\n\nBut phenotypically:\n\n- CC (Red): Phenotype = Red \u2192 25%\n- Cc (Red): Phenotype = Red \u2192 25%\n- cc (Plain): Phenotype = Plain \u2192 25%\n- BB (Brown): Phenotype = Brown \u2192 25%\n- Bb (Brown): Phenotype = Brown \u2192 25%\n- bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Checkered \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that sums up to 6 phenotypes, but some phenotypes may overlap. Wait no, the user's options seem to group them differently.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, for instance option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up unless there's something missing. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parent pair isn't CC BB and cc bb. Maybe it's CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, which would mean the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be more varied.\n\nWait, let me redo the setup.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (dominant for both C and B)\nParent 2: cc bb (recessive for both C and B)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be all CcBb. Because each parent can only produce CB and cb gametes respectively.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs:\n\n- For gene C: Parent 1 produces C (100%) and Parent 2 produces c (100%). So F2 for C is 50% C and 50% c.\n- For gene B: Same logic, 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the genes assort independently, the F2 genotypes would be a combination of C/c and B/b. Thus, the four possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (C and B) \u2192 Phenotype = Red-Brown\n- Cc (C and B) \u2192 Phenotype = Red-Brown\n- cc (c and b) \u2192 Phenotype = Plain-Checkered\n- BB (B and B) \u2192 Phenotype = Brown-Brown\n- Bb (B and b) \u2192 Phenotype = Brown-Checkered\n- bb (b and b) \u2192 Phenotype = Checkered-Checkered\n\nWait, but the user's options don't match this directly. Instead, the options seem to focus on specific phenotypes like checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to determine which F2 phenotypes correspond to each genotype. For example:\n\n- CC (Red-Carbon): Phenotype = Red (since C is dominant)\n- Cc (Red-Carbon): Phenotype = Red\n- cc (Plain-Checkered): Phenotype = Plain\n- BB (Brown-Black): Phenotype = Brown\n- Bb (Brown-Checkered): Phenotype = Brown\n- bb (Checkered-Checkered): Phenotype = Checkered\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are: Red, Red, Plain, Brown, Brown, Checkered.\n\nBut now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see what each option states.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing these gives 5+3+2+6=16, but total possible outcomes are 16 (since each gene has two possibilities, 2x2=4, but each having 4 combinations, leading to 16 phenotypes). Wait, no, if each gene is present in 2 forms, and they're independent, the number of phenotypes would be 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4, but considering dominance, it might collapse some into the same phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2, each combination of C/c and B/b has a 25% chance.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. CC (Red): Phenotype = Red \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n2. Cc (Red): Phenotype = Red \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n3. cc (Plain): Phenotype = Plain \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n4. BB (Brown): Phenotype = Brown \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n5. Bb (Brown): Phenotype = Brown \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n6. bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Checkered \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n\nWait, but that would imply that each phenotype (Red, Red, Plain, Brown, Brown, Checkered) has 25% frequency, totaling 6 phenotypes, each occurring 1/4 of the time. However, the user's options don't reflect this. They list four phenotypes, each with varying counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to group checkered and plain together, but that's unclear. Looking back, the original question lists four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But according to our analysis, each phenotype (including checkered and plain) occurs 25%, so none of the options perfectly match this. This suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within the specified categories without considering the actual individual phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that checkered individuals have two coats of checkered, while plain have two coats of plain. Red and brown are determined by the respective genes, regardless of coat color. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (both checkered and red)\n- Checkered brown (both checkered and brown)\n- Plain red (both plain and red)\n- Plain brown (both plain and brown)\n\nEach of these would occur 25% of the time, but perhaps the user wants the count within each category, ignoring the underlying coat color. In that case, each category would have 25% of the F2 population, but given the options, perhaps the counts are presented in terms of how many of each type are present in a larger sample.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't sum to 16 (the total possible F2 individuals), except for E, which is 3, 9, 1, 3, adding to 16. So, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the actual numbers rather than percentages.\n\nWait, but the initial problem statement mentions checking the F2 generation, so perhaps we should look at the actual genotypic and phenotypic ratios based on the F2 squares.\n\nAnother approach is to construct the Punnett square for F2. The F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are:\n\n- CB (from C from F1 and B from F1)\n- cb (from c from F1 and b from F1)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no, each parent contributes one allele, so actually, the F2 will have four types of gametes, leading to four types of F2 genotypes.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for F2:\n\nGametes from F1 (CcBb):\n\n- CB (50%)\n- cb (50%)\n\nSo, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each parent produces gametes, so the F2 genotypes are the combinations of the gametes. Since each F1 produces CB and cb, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB (but wait, F1 is Cc BB, so each gamete is either CB or cb. So, F2 genotypes are Cc (from CB + CB or CB + cb) and Bb (from CB + Bb or cb + Bb). Hmm, getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, since F1 is CcBb, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- Cc (from Cc parent) \u00d7 Bb (from Bb parent) \u2192 four possibilities:\n\n  - CcBb (25%)\n  - Ccbb (25%)\n  - ccBb (25%)\n  - ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, that makes sense because each gene segregates independently. So, in the F2, the four possible genotypes are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb, each at 25%.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype = Red-Brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype = Red-Checkered\n- ccBb \u2192 Phenotype = Plain-Brown\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype = Checkered-Checkered\n\nNow, the question is about the phenotypic ratio among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, we need to identify which F2 genotypes fall into each category.\n\nFrom the above:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown \u2192 Doesn't fit any of the specified categories (none listed).\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Red-Checkered \u2192 F2 phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain-Brown \u2192 Not matching any specified category.\n4. ccbb \u2192 Checkered-Checkered \u2192 F2 phenotype: Checkered plain\n\nWait, but the question specifies \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", \"plain brown\". None of the F2 genotypes match these. Only Ccbb matches \"Checkered brown\" and ccbb matches \"Checkered plain\".\n\nThis suggests that the initial understanding is incorrect, possibly due to misinterpretation of the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the underlying coat color and simply categorize based on whether the phenotype is red, brown, plain, or checkered, irrespective of the coat color.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Red \u2192 Checkered red\n- Ccbb \u2192 Red \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain \u2192 Checkered plain\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, but that still leaves some confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing solely on the phenotypic expression, without considering the underlying coat color, thus grouping checkered and plain together, and similarly red and brown together.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Phenotype groups:\n\n  - Checkered (both checkered)\n  - Plain (both plain)\n  - Red (both red)\n  - Brown (both brown)\n\nEach would occur at 25% frequency, so the ratio would be 25:25:25:25, or simplified to 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options provided don't align with this exact ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Total 16\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nGiven that each phenotype (red, brown, plain, checkered) occurs 25% of the time, none of the options exactly match this. However, perhaps the question is considering only two phenotypes for each trait (e.g., red vs brown), treating each as a binary trait. If that's the case, then:\n\n- Red (dominant) \u2192 50%\n- Brown (dominant) \u2192 50%\n\nAnd the other two traits (checkered vs plain) are independent and also 50% each. So, the phenotypic ratio could be calculated based on the combinations of these traits.\n\nWait, but the user's options suggest different groupings. Perhaps the key is to recognize that the presence of a dominant allele leads to a particular phenotype, regardless of the other traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the actual genotypes and counting how many fall into each phenotype category. Given that each F2 genotype has a 25% chance, but perhaps the user is expecting a ratio based on the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- 9:3:3:1 for each gene, but combined.\n\nBut in reality, the four possible F2 phenotypes each have 25% chance, so 4 phenotypes each at 25%. However, if the question is listing four phenotypes, each corresponding to a unique combination of C/C and B/B, then each has 25% occurrence, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't provide such a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying the problem by grouping checkered and plain together, and red and brown together, resulting in four phenotypes each with 25% frequency, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not match this exactly. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That totals 16, which is correct, but the ratios aren't equal. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic classes. Let me re-examine the user's question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Then provided a Punnett square for a cross between CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, showing gametes: CB, cb, Cc, cb, Cc, cb, etc. Then the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is constructed.\n\nThen, the user presents a table of phenotypes:\n\nF1 Genotypes: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 resulting in eight gametes, grouped as CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the setup. Instead of F1 being CcBb, it should be Cc (from CC and cc) \u00d7 Bb (from BB and bb), leading to CcBb. But perhaps the user intended to represent the F1 correctly.\n\nRegardless, moving forward, the F2 from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb would have four genotypes, each with 25% chance.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual genes are independent, we'd expect a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four phenotypes.\n\nWait, but hold on. Actually, each parent contributes gametes independently. So the F2 will have a distribution where each phenotype occurs according to the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed. Alternatively, since each trait is controlled by separate genes, we can model them separately and then combine the results.\n\nLet's tackle each gene separately:\n\n1. Gene C ( pigment color ):\n   - Parent 1 (CC) can only produce C gametes.\n   - Parent 2 (cc) can only produce c gametes.\n   So, F1 (Cc) will produce C and c gametes equally (50% each).\n\n2. Gene B (color):\n   - Parent 1 (BB) can only produce B gametes.\n   - Parent 2 (bb) can only produce b gametes.\n   So, F1 (Bb) will produce B and b gametes equally (50% each).\n\nSince these genes assort independently, the combined F2 will have a 1/4 chance for each combination of C/B traits. Specifically:\n\n- CC (C dominant): Phenotype = Red\n- Cc (C dominant): Phenotype = Red (since c is recessive)\n- cc (c dominant): Phenotype = Plain\n- BB (B dominant): Phenotype = Brown\n- Bb (B dominant): Phenotype = Brown\n- bb (b dominant): Phenotype = Checkered\n\nBut wait, the user's options mention \"red,\" \"brown,\" etc., so let's map this.\n\nThe possible F2 phenotypes are: red, brown, checkered, and plain. But the user's options don't include checkered and plain, only red, brown, etc. Wait, looking back, the user didn't specify that the F2 includes all possible phenotypes, but the problem asks for the F2 phenotypic ratio, along with genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios.\n\nSo, the F2 will have four possible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B:\n\n1. CC (Red): Phenotype = Red\n2. Cc (Red): Phenotype = Red\n3. cc (Plain): Phenotype = Plain\n4. BB (Brown): Phenotype = Brown\n5. Bb (Brown): Phenotype = Brown\n6. bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Checkered\n\nNow, the proportion for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each gene is segregating at a 1:1 ratio, the overall F2 will have four phenotypic categories, each with a certain probability.\n\nFor example, the probability of being Red (either CC or Cc) is (1/2 * 1) + (1/2 * 1) )= 1/2. Similarly, the probability of being Plain (cc) is 1/4. Brown (BB or Bb) is also 1/2, and Checkered (bb) is 1/4.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me calculate more precisely.\n\nEach gene segregates into C/c and B/b with equal probability (50% each). Since the genes are independent, the four possible F2 genotypes each have a 25% chance.\n\nBut phenotypically:\n\n- CC (Red): Phenotype = Red \u2192 25%\n- Cc (Red): Phenotype = Red \u2192 25%\n- cc (Plain): Phenotype = Plain \u2192 25%\n- BB (Brown): Phenotype = Brown \u2192 25%\n- Bb (Brown): Phenotype = Brown \u2192 25%\n- bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Checkered \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that sums up to 6 phenotypes, but some phenotypes may overlap. Wait no, the user's options seem to group them differently.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, for instance option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up unless there's something missing. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parent pair isn't CC BB and cc bb. Maybe it's CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, which would mean the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be more varied.\n\nWait, let me redo the setup.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (dominant for both C and B)\nParent 2: cc bb (recessive for both C and B)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be all CcBb. Because each parent can only produce CB and cb gametes respectively.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs:\n\n- For gene C: Parent 1 produces C (100%) and Parent 2 produces c (100%). So F2 for C is 50% C and 50% c.\n- For gene B: Same logic, 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the genes assort independently, the F2 genotypes would be a combination of C/c and B/b. Thus, the four possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (C and B) \u2192 Phenotype = Red-Brown\n- Cc (C and B) \u2192 Phenotype = Red-Brown\n- cc (c and b) \u2192 Phenotype = Plain-Checkered\n- BB (B and B) \u2192 Phenotype = Brown-Brown\n- Bb (B and b) \u2192 Phenotype = Brown-Checkered\n- bb (b and b) \u2192 Phenotype = Checkered-Checkered\n\nWait, but the user's options don't match this directly. Instead, the options seem to focus on specific phenotypes like checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to determine which F2 phenotypes correspond to each genotype. For example:\n\n- CC (Red-Carbon): Phenotype = Red (since C is dominant)\n- Cc (Red-Carbon): Phenotype = Red\n- cc (Plain-Checkered): Phenotype = Plain\n- BB (Brown-Black): Phenotype = Brown\n- Bb (Brown-Checkered): Phenotype = Brown\n- bb (Checkered-Checkered): Phenotype = Checkered\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are: Red, Red, Plain, Brown, Brown, Checkered.\n\nBut now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see what each option states.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing these gives 5+3+2+6=16, but total possible outcomes are 16 (since each gene has two possibilities, 2x2=4, but each having 4 combinations, leading to 16 phenotypes). Wait, no, if each gene is present in 2 forms, and they're independent, the number of phenotypes would be 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4, but considering dominance, it might collapse some into the same phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2, each combination of C/c and B/b has a 25% chance.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. CC (Red): Phenotype = Red \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n2. Cc (Red): Phenotype = Red \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n3. cc (Plain): Phenotype = Plain \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n4. BB (Brown): Phenotype = Brown \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n5. Bb (Brown): Phenotype = Brown \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n6. bb (Checkered): Phenotype = Checkered \u2192 Frequency = 25%\n\nWait, but that would imply that each phenotype (Red, Red, Plain, Brown, Brown, Checkered) has 25% frequency, totaling 6 phenotypes, each occurring 1/4 of the time. However, the user's options don't reflect this. They list four phenotypes, each with varying counts.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to group checkered and plain together, but that's unclear. Looking back, the original question lists four phenotypes: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But according to our analysis, each phenotype (including checkered and plain) occurs 25%, so none of the options perfectly match this. This suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within the specified categories without considering the actual individual phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that checkered individuals have two coats of checkered, while plain have two coats of plain. Red and brown are determined by the respective genes, regardless of coat color. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (both checkered and red)\n- Checkered brown (both checkered and brown)\n- Plain red (both plain and red)\n- Plain brown (both plain and brown)\n\nEach of these would occur 25% of the time, but perhaps the user wants the count within each category, ignoring the underlying coat color. In that case, each category would have 25% of the F2 population, but given the options, perhaps the counts are presented in terms of how many of each type are present in a larger sample.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't sum to 16 (the total possible F2 individuals), except for E, which is 3, 9, 1, 3, adding to 16. So, perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the actual numbers rather than percentages.\n\nWait, but the initial problem statement mentions checking the F2 generation, so perhaps we should look at the actual genotypic and phenotypic ratios based on the F2 squares.\n\nAnother approach is to construct the Punnett square for F2. The F1 from CC BB \u00d7 cc bb is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are:\n\n- CB (from C from F1 and B from F1)\n- cb (from c from F1 and b from F1)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no, each parent contributes one allele, so actually, the F2 will have four types of gametes, leading to four types of F2 genotypes.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for F2:\n\nGametes from F1 (CcBb):\n\n- CB (50%)\n- cb (50%)\n\nSo, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each parent produces gametes, so the F2 genotypes are the combinations of the gametes. Since each F1 produces CB and cb, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB (but wait, F1 is Cc BB, so each gamete is either CB or cb. So, F2 genotypes are Cc (from CB + CB or CB + cb) and Bb (from CB + Bb or cb + Bb). Hmm, getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, since F1 is CcBb, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- Cc (from Cc parent) \u00d7 Bb (from Bb parent) \u2192 four possibilities:\n\n  - CcBb (25%)\n  - Ccbb (25%)\n  - ccBb (25%)\n  - ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, that makes sense because each gene segregates independently. So, in the F2, the four possible genotypes are CcBb, Ccbb, ccBb, and ccbb, each at 25%.\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype = Red-Brown\n- Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype = Red-Checkered\n- ccBb \u2192 Phenotype = Plain-Brown\n- ccbb \u2192 Phenotype = Checkered-Checkered\n\nNow, the question is about the phenotypic ratio among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So, we need to identify which F2 genotypes fall into each category.\n\nFrom the above:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown \u2192 Doesn't fit any of the specified categories (none listed).\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Red-Checkered \u2192 F2 phenotype: Checkered brown\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain-Brown \u2192 Not matching any specified category.\n4. ccbb \u2192 Checkered-Checkered \u2192 F2 phenotype: Checkered plain\n\nWait, but the question specifies \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", \"plain brown\". None of the F2 genotypes match these. Only Ccbb matches \"Checkered brown\" and ccbb matches \"Checkered plain\".\n\nThis suggests that the initial understanding is incorrect, possibly due to misinterpretation of the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the underlying coat color and simply categorize based on whether the phenotype is red, brown, plain, or checkered, irrespective of the coat color.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Red \u2192 Checkered red\n- Ccbb \u2192 Red \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb \u2192 Plain \u2192 Checkered plain\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, but that still leaves some confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the question is focusing solely on the phenotypic expression, without considering the underlying coat color, thus grouping checkered and plain together, and similarly red and brown together.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Phenotype groups:\n\n  - Checkered (both checkered)\n  - Plain (both plain)\n  - Red (both red)\n  - Brown (both brown)\n\nEach would occur at 25% frequency, so the ratio would be 25:25:25:25, or simplified to 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut the options provided don't align with this exact ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Total 16\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nGiven that each phenotype (red, brown, plain, checkered) occurs 25% of the time, none of the options exactly match this. However, perhaps the question is considering only two phenotypes for each trait (e.g., red vs brown), treating each as a binary trait. If that's the case, then:\n\n- Red (dominant) \u2192 50%\n- Brown (dominant) \u2192 50%\n\nAnd the other two traits (checkered vs plain) are independent and also 50% each. So, the phenotypic ratio could be calculated based on the combinations of these traits.\n\nWait, but the user's options suggest different groupings. Perhaps the key is to recognize that the presence of a dominant allele leads to a particular phenotype, regardless of the other traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the actual genotypes and counting how many fall into each phenotype category. Given that each F2 genotype has a 25% chance, but perhaps the user is expecting a ratio based on the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- 9:3:3:1 for each gene, but combined.\n\nBut in reality, the four possible F2 phenotypes each have 25% chance, so 4 phenotypes each at 25%. However, if the question is listing four phenotypes, each corresponding to a unique combination of C/C and B/B, then each has 25% occurrence, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't provide such a ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying the problem by grouping checkered and plain together, and red and brown together, resulting in four phenotypes each with 25% frequency, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not match this exactly. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That totals 16, which is correct, but the ratios aren't equal. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question setup, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic classes. Let me re-examine the user's question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Then provided a Punnett square for a cross between CCBB \u00d7 ccbb, showing gametes: CB, cb, Cc, cb, Cc, cb, etc. Then the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is constructed.\n\nThen, the user presents a table of phenotypes:\n\nF1 Genotypes: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb \u2192 resulting in eight gametes, grouped as CB, cb, cB, cb.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the setup. Instead of F1 being CcBb, it should be Cc (from CC and cc) \u00d7 Bb (from BB and bb), leading to CcBb. But perhaps the user intended to represent the F1 correctly.\n\nRegardless, moving forward, the F2 from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb would have four genotypes, each with 25% chance. Mapping those to phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. Ccbb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. ccBb \u2192 Plain-Brown\n4. ccbb \u2192 Checkered-Checkered\n\nBut the user's options don't account for this,",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes may express the same phenotype.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes may express the same phenotype. But the question asks about phenotypes, not genotypes. So, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, maybe I got confused earlier. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would involve crossing CcBb with itself. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each with a 50% chance. So F2 would have four types:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 CB = cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because when you cross CcBb with CcBb, the F2 should include all possible combinations. Let me write out the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1 (F1): CcBb\nParent 2 (F1): CcBb\n\nGametes from Parent 1: CB, cb\nGametes from Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like:\n\n        | CB    | cb\n      ----------------\n      CB     | CC BB | Cc BB\n      cb      | Cc BB | cc BB\n\nSimilarly for the other rows:\n\n       | CB    | cb\n     ----------------\n     CB     | CC BB | Cc BB\n     cb      | Cc BB | cc BB\n\n       | CB    | cb\n     ----------------\n     CB     | CC BB | Cc BB\n     cb      | Cc BB | cc BB\n\nWait, that seems off because when you cross CcBb x CcBb, the possible offspring genotypes are CC BB (25%), Cc BB (50%), cc BB (25%), and bb (25%). But when considering dominance, some phenotypes might combine. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigmentation (B/b):\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n- Color (C/c):\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. Let's list the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u21d2 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C (red) ; B (brown) \u21d2 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: C (red); b (checkered) \u21d2 Checkered plain\n4. CC bb: same as above\nWait, no\u2014it's CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, etc., but for F2, we'll consider all possible combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me approach it differently. Each gene's effect is independent, so the overall phenotype is a combination of both genes.\n\nFor each bird in F2:\n\n- If it's BB (both B and b), then brown.\n- If it's bb (both b and b), then plain.\n- If it's Bb (one B and one b), then brown.\n- Similarly for C/C (C and C) \u2192 red; C/c \u2192 plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype. So, for each gene independently:\n\n- For pigment (B/b):\n  - Dominant B \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 plain\n- For color (C/c):\n  - Dominant C \u2192 red\n  - Recessive c \u2192 plain\n\nSince the two traits are linked (assuming they are), the combined phenotype can vary based on both genes. However, the problem statement doesn't mention linkage, so we assume independent assortment.\n\nNow, let's construct the F2 genotypes:\n\nEach bird in F2 has a 25% chance of being:\n\n- CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb (Red Brown)\n- CC bb (Red Plain)\n- CC bb (Red Plain)\n- CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb (Red Brown)\n- CC bb (Red Plain)\n- CC bb (Red Plain)\n- And similarly for the other row.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake. Actually, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CC bb (Checkered Plain)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Plain)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Checkered Plain)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered Red)\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because each parent contributes one allele per gene, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- For pigment (B/b):\n  - BB (red), Bb (brown), bb (plain)\n- For color (C/c):\n  - CC (red), Cc (plain), cc (plain)\n\nThe F2 phenotypes depend on both. Let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since 4x4=16).\n\nNow, let's categorize them into phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red:\n   - Occurs when both genes are dominant: CC BB and cc bb.\n   - Number of such individuals: 2 (because 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 each, so 2 total).\n   \n2. Checkered Brown:\n   - Occurs when C is dominant and B is dominant: CC Bb and cc Bb.\n   - Number of such individuals: 2 (same logic as above).\n\n3. Checkered Plain:\n   - Occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive: CC bb and cc bb.\n   - Number of such individuals: 2.\n\n4. Plain Red:\n   - Occurs when both C and B are recessive: cc BB and cc Bb.\n   - Number of such individuals: 2.\n\nWait, that adds up to 8, but there are 16 individuals, so missing something. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- CC bb: 1\n- CC bb: another 1 (total 4 for CC)\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n- cc bb: another 1 (total 4 for cc)\n\nNow, checking for phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB (1), cc bb (1) \u2192 Total 2\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb (1), cc Bb (1) \u2192 Total 2\n- Checkered Plain: CC bb (1), cc bb (1) \u2192 Total 2\n- Plain Red: cc BB (1), cc Bb (1) \u2192 Total 2\n\nThat accounts for all 8, but we have 16 individuals. Oh, wait\u2014no, I think I missed that there are 16 possible combinations, but each F2 individual has two alleles per gene, leading to 2^4 = 16 possible genotypes. So, my previous breakdown was incomplete. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb: Checkered Plain\n4. cc BB: Plain Red\n5. cc Bb: Plain Brown\n6. cc bb: Plain Plain\n\nWait, but this still sums up to 6 phenotypes, but according to the options given, the phenotypic ratios are listed in terms of specific counts.\n\nAlternatively, considering dominance, perhaps some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. For example, if both B and b are present, regardless of order, the bird is brown. Similarly, regardless of color alleles, if both are recessive, it's plain. So, the phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n- Checkered Red (only B and C dominant)\n- Checkered Brown (only B dominant)\n- Checkered Plain (only C dominant)\n- Plain Red (only C recessive)\n- Plain Brown (only B recessive)\n- Plain Plain (both recessive)\n\nBut the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. However, looking back at the options, the answer choices don't include six phenotypes; instead, they list four phenotypes. This suggests that perhaps the question is asking about the ratio within each phenotype category rather than across all phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe I've misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". That sums to 16, matching the 16 F2 individuals. But how does this come about?\n\nLet me calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red: Occurs when both B and C are dominant. So, from F2:\n\n   - CC BB\n   - CC Bb\n   - cc bb (but wait, no\u2014wait, CC BB is red checkered, CC Bb is red checkered, and cc BB is plain red.)\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, each bird can be:\n\n- CC BB: Red Checkered\n- CC Bb: Red Checkered\n- CC bb: Red Plain\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Plain\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Red Checkered: CC BB (1), CC Bb (1) \u2192 2\n- Red Plain: CC bb (1), cc BB (1) \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: cc BB (1), cc Bb (1) \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: cc Bb (1), cc bb (1) \u2192 2\n- Plain Checkered: None, as all checkered have either B or C dominant.\n\nWait, now adding up: 2 (Checkered Red) + 2 (Red Plain) + 2 (Plain Red) + 2 (Plain Brown) = 8. But there are 16 F2 individuals, so the remaining 8 must be something else. Wait, no\u2014maybe I'm missing the fact that some genotypes could result in the same phenotype due to dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to recognize that the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective phenotype. So, for pigment (B/b):\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive b \u2192 Plain\n\nAnd for color (C/c):\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 Red\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, the phenotype is a combination of both:\n\n- Both B and C \u2192 Brown Red (Checkered)\n- B \u2192 Brown, c \u2192 Plain \u2192 Brown Plain\n- b \u2192 Plain, C \u2192 Red \u2192 Plain Red\n- b and c \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype isn't a combination but rather the presence of dominant alleles. So, for pigment, it's brown if B is present, otherwise plain. For color, it's red if C is present, otherwise plain. So, a bird is brown-red if it has at least one dominant allele for both traits. Otherwise, it's brown (if only pigment is brown) or plain (if neither trait is dominant).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Brown Red (Checkered)\n2. Brown Plain (Only pigment brown)\n3. Plain Red (Only color red)\n4. Plain Plain (Neither trait dominant)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each:\n\n1. Brown Red: All birds where B is present and C is present \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb. So, 4 birds.\n2. Brown Plain: Birds where B is present but C is absent \u2192 CC Bb, cc Bb. So, 2 birds.\n3. Plain Red: Birds where C is present but B is absent \u2192 CC bb, cc bb. So, 2 birds.\n4. Plain Plain: Birds where neither B nor C is present \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. Wait, no\u2014cc BB would have B dominant, so that's brown-red. Wait, no\u2014cc BB would be brown-red, but cc BB is brown-red, so that shouldn't be counted as plain plain. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's correct this:\n\n- For Brown Red (Checkered): Any bird with at least one B and at least one C. So, CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb. That's 4 birds.\n\n- For Brown Plain (Only pigment brown): Birds with B present but C absent \u2192 CC Bb, cc Bb. That's 2 birds.\n\n- For Plain Red (Only color red): Birds with C present but B absent \u2192 CC bb, cc bb. That's 2 birds.\n\n- For Plain Plain (Neither trait): Birds without any dominant alleles \u2192 cc BB (has B but also C?), no. Wait, cc BB has B (since B is dominant), so that's brown-red. Wait, no\u2014cc BB would have B dominant, so it's brown-red. Thus, the only birds without any dominant traits would be those where both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb. So, 1 bird.\n\nBut this contradicts the options provided, which suggest multiple birds for each phenotype. Perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the F2 generation's phenotype distribution based on dominance, ignoring the actual genotypes beyond the phenotypes. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered Red (B and C present): 25% (from 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 each, so 2 total)\n- Checkered Brown (B present, c absent): 25%\n- Checkered Plain (c present, B absent): 25%\n- Plain Red (c and B absent): 25%\n- Plain Brown (c present, C absent): 25%\n- Plain Plain (both c and B absent): 25%\n\nSo, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time, totaling 6 phenotypes, but the options provided only list four. This suggests that perhaps the question is only considering the presence of dominant traits, grouping Checkered Red and others together, but that doesn't align with typical genetics problems.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16.\n\nIf the phenotypic ratio is based on dominance, then:\n\n- Checkered Red: 12 (all cases where B and/or C is present)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (only B present)\n- Plain Red: 2 (only C present)\n- Plain Brown: 0 (neither B nor C present, but this would imply no birds with both recessives, which contradicts the math)\n- But this doesn't add up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of B and C, and ignoring the order. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it's considered non-checkered. But this interpretation doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is asking for the ratio of the F2 generation in terms of the number of birds per phenotype, considering only the presence of dominant alleles, thus grouping Checkered Red with other non-checkered phenotypes. But this would complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the F2 generation. Maybe the problem is simpler, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAssuming that the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of the parents' gametes, which are:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC BB): CB\n\nFrom Parent 2 (cc bb): cb\n\nThus, the F1 is CcBb. The F2 is generated by selfing F1:\n\n- Gametes from F1: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by dominance:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n- CC bb: Checkered Plain\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Plain\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red: CC BB and cc bb \u2192 2\n2. Checkered Brown: CC Bb and cc bb \u2192 2\n3. Checkered Plain: CC bb and cc BB \u2192 2\n4. Plain Red: cc BB and cc Bb \u2192 2\n5. Plain Brown: cc Bb and cc bb \u2192 2\n6. Plain Plain: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nThis totals 12 (2+2+2+2+2+1=12), but the sum exceeds 16. Wait, no\u2014each F2 bird has two alleles per trait, so the correct count should be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 (CC BB and cc bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (CC Bb and cc bb)\n- Checkered Plain: 2 (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain Red: 2 (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 2 (cc Bb and cc bb)\n- Plain Plain: 1 (cc bb)\n\nAdding these up: 2+2+2+2+2+1=11, which is less than 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that each F2 bird has two alleles per trait, so the phenotypic ratio is calculated based on the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the frequency for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Red: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 2/16 = 1/8\n- Checkered Brown: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 2/16 = 1/8\n- Checkered Plain: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Red: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 2/16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes may express the same phenotype. But the question asks about phenotypes, not genotypes. So, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, maybe I got confused earlier. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 would involve crossing CcBb with itself. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each with a 50% chance. So F2 would have four types:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 CB = cc BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because when you cross CcBb with CcBb, the F2 should include all possible combinations. Let me write out the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1 (F1): CcBb\nParent 2 (F1): CcBb\n\nGametes from Parent 1: CB, cb\nGametes from Parent 2: CB, cb\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like:\n\n        | CB    | cb\n      ----------------\n      CB     | CC BB | Cc BB\n      cb      | Cc BB | cc BB\n\nSimilarly for the other rows:\n\n       | CB    | cb\n     ----------------\n     CB     | CC BB | Cc BB\n     cb      | Cc BB | cc BB\n\n       | CB    | cb\n     ----------------\n     CB     | CC BB | Cc BB\n     cb      | Cc BB | cc BB\n\nWait, that seems off because when you cross CcBb x CcBb, the possible offspring genotypes are CC BB (25%), Cc BB (50%), cc BB (25%), and bb (25%). But when considering dominance, some phenotypes might combine. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigmentation (B/b):\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n- Color (C/c):\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. Let's list the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: C (dominant) \u2192 red; B (dominant) \u2192 brown \u21d2 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C (red) ; B (brown) \u21d2 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: C (red); b (checkered) \u21d2 Checkered plain\n4. CC bb: same as above\nWait, no\u2014it's CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, etc., but for F2, we'll consider all possible combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me approach it differently. Each gene's effect is independent, so the overall phenotype is a combination of both genes.\n\nFor each bird in F2:\n\n- If it's BB (both B and b), then brown.\n- If it's bb (both b and b), then plain.\n- If it's Bb (one B and one b), then brown.\n- Similarly for C/C (C and C) \u2192 red; C/c \u2192 plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype. So, for each gene independently:\n\n- For pigment (B/b):\n  - Dominant B \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive b \u2192 plain\n- For color (C/c):\n  - Dominant C \u2192 red\n  - Recessive c \u2192 plain\n\nSince the two traits are linked (assuming they are), the combined phenotype can vary based on both genes. However, the problem statement doesn't mention linkage, so we assume independent assortment.\n\nNow, let's construct the F2 genotypes:\n\nEach bird in F2 has a 25% chance of being:\n\n- CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb (Red Brown)\n- CC bb (Red Plain)\n- CC bb (Red Plain)\n- CC BB (Red Brown)\n- CC Bb (Red Brown)\n- CC bb (Red Plain)\n- CC bb (Red Plain)\n- And similarly for the other row.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake. Actually, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CC bb (Checkered Plain)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Plain Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Plain)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Checkered Plain)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered Red)\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because each parent contributes one allele per gene, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- For pigment (B/b):\n  - BB (red), Bb (brown), bb (plain)\n- For color (C/c):\n  - CC (red), Cc (plain), cc (plain)\n\nThe F2 phenotypes depend on both. Let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since 4x4=16).\n\nNow, let's categorize them into phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Red:\n   - Occurs when both genes are dominant: CC BB and cc bb.\n   - Number of such individuals: 2 (because 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 each, so 2 total).\n   \n2. Checkered Brown:\n   - Occurs when C is dominant and B is dominant: CC Bb and cc Bb.\n   - Number of such individuals: 2 (same logic as above).\n\n3. Checkered Plain:\n   - Occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive: CC bb and cc bb.\n   - Number of such individuals: 2.\n\n4. Plain Red:\n   - Occurs when both C and B are recessive: cc BB and cc Bb.\n   - Number of such individuals: 2.\n\nWait, that adds up to 8, but there are 16 individuals, so missing something. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- CC BB: 1\n- CC Bb: 1\n- CC bb: 1\n- CC bb: another 1 (total 4 for CC)\n- cc BB: 1\n- cc Bb: 1\n- cc bb: 1\n- cc bb: another 1 (total 4 for cc)\n\nNow, checking for phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB (1), cc bb (1) \u2192 Total 2\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb (1), cc Bb (1) \u2192 Total 2\n- Checkered Plain: CC bb (1), cc bb (1) \u2192 Total 2\n- Plain Red: cc BB (1), cc Bb (1) \u2192 Total 2\n\nThat accounts for all 8, but we have 16 individuals. Oh, wait\u2014no, I think I missed that there are 16 possible combinations, but each F2 individual has two alleles per gene, leading to 2^4 = 16 possible genotypes. So, my previous breakdown was incomplete. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb: Checkered Plain\n4. cc BB: Plain Red\n5. cc Bb: Plain Brown\n6. cc bb: Plain Plain\n\nWait, but this still sums up to 6 phenotypes, but according to the options given, the phenotypic ratios are listed in terms of specific counts.\n\nAlternatively, considering dominance, perhaps some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. For example, if both B and b are present, regardless of order, the bird is brown. Similarly, regardless of color alleles, if both are recessive, it's plain. So, the phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThus, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n- Checkered Red (only B and C dominant)\n- Checkered Brown (only B dominant)\n- Checkered Plain (only C dominant)\n- Plain Red (only C recessive)\n- Plain Brown (only B recessive)\n- Plain Plain (both recessive)\n\nBut the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. However, looking back at the options, the answer choices don't include six phenotypes; instead, they list four phenotypes. This suggests that perhaps the question is asking about the ratio within each phenotype category rather than across all phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe I've misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". That sums to 16, matching the 16 F2 individuals. But how does this come about?\n\nLet me calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red: Occurs when both B and C are dominant. So, from F2:\n\n   - CC BB\n   - CC Bb\n   - cc bb (but wait, no\u2014wait, CC BB is red checkered, CC Bb is red checkered, and cc BB is plain red.)\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIn F2, each bird can be:\n\n- CC BB: Red Checkered\n- CC Bb: Red Checkered\n- CC bb: Red Plain\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Plain\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Red Checkered: CC BB (1), CC Bb (1) \u2192 2\n- Red Plain: CC bb (1), cc BB (1) \u2192 2\n- Plain Red: cc BB (1), cc Bb (1) \u2192 2\n- Plain Brown: cc Bb (1), cc bb (1) \u2192 2\n- Plain Checkered: None, as all checkered have either B or C dominant.\n\nWait, now adding up: 2 (Checkered Red) + 2 (Red Plain) + 2 (Plain Red) + 2 (Plain Brown) = 8. But there are 16 F2 individuals, so the remaining 8 must be something else. Wait, no\u2014maybe I'm missing the fact that some genotypes could result in the same phenotype due to dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to recognize that the presence of dominant alleles results in the respective phenotype. So, for pigment (B/b):\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive b \u2192 Plain\n\nAnd for color (C/c):\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 Red\n- Recessive c \u2192 Plain\n\nSo, the phenotype is a combination of both:\n\n- Both B and C \u2192 Brown Red (Checkered)\n- B \u2192 Brown, c \u2192 Plain \u2192 Brown Plain\n- b \u2192 Plain, C \u2192 Red \u2192 Plain Red\n- b and c \u2192 Plain Plain\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotype isn't a combination but rather the presence of dominant alleles. So, for pigment, it's brown if B is present, otherwise plain. For color, it's red if C is present, otherwise plain. So, a bird is brown-red if it has at least one dominant allele for both traits. Otherwise, it's brown (if only pigment is brown) or plain (if neither trait is dominant).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Brown Red (Checkered)\n2. Brown Plain (Only pigment brown)\n3. Plain Red (Only color red)\n4. Plain Plain (Neither trait dominant)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each:\n\n1. Brown Red: All birds where B is present and C is present \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb. So, 4 birds.\n2. Brown Plain: Birds where B is present but C is absent \u2192 CC Bb, cc Bb. So, 2 birds.\n3. Plain Red: Birds where C is present but B is absent \u2192 CC bb, cc bb. So, 2 birds.\n4. Plain Plain: Birds where neither B nor C is present \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb. Wait, no\u2014cc BB would have B dominant, so that's brown-red. Wait, no\u2014cc BB would be brown-red, but cc BB is brown-red, so that shouldn't be counted as plain plain. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's correct this:\n\n- For Brown Red (Checkered): Any bird with at least one B and at least one C. So, CC BB, CC Bb, cc BB, cc Bb. That's 4 birds.\n\n- For Brown Plain (Only pigment brown): Birds with B present but C absent \u2192 CC Bb, cc Bb. That's 2 birds.\n\n- For Plain Red (Only color red): Birds with C present but B absent \u2192 CC bb, cc bb. That's 2 birds.\n\n- For Plain Plain (Neither trait): Birds without any dominant alleles \u2192 cc BB (has B but also C?), no. Wait, cc BB has B (since B is dominant), so that's brown-red. Wait, no\u2014cc BB would have B dominant, so it's brown-red. Thus, the only birds without any dominant traits would be those where both B and C are recessive \u2192 cc bb. So, 1 bird.\n\nBut this contradicts the options provided, which suggest multiple birds for each phenotype. Perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is focusing on the F2 generation's phenotype distribution based on dominance, ignoring the actual genotypes beyond the phenotypes. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered Red (B and C present): 25% (from 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 each, so 2 total)\n- Checkered Brown (B present, c absent): 25%\n- Checkered Plain (c present, B absent): 25%\n- Plain Red (c and B absent): 25%\n- Plain Brown (c present, C absent): 25%\n- Plain Plain (both c and B absent): 25%\n\nSo, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time, totaling 6 phenotypes, but the options provided only list four. This suggests that perhaps the question is only considering the presence of dominant traits, grouping Checkered Red and others together, but that doesn't align with typical genetics problems.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16.\n\nIf the phenotypic ratio is based on dominance, then:\n\n- Checkered Red: 12 (all cases where B and/or C is present)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (only B present)\n- Plain Red: 2 (only C present)\n- Plain Brown: 0 (neither B nor C present, but this would imply no birds with both recessives, which contradicts the math)\n- But this doesn't add up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of B and C, and ignoring the order. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it's considered non-checkered. But this interpretation doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is asking for the ratio of the F2 generation in terms of the number of birds per phenotype, considering only the presence of dominant alleles, thus grouping Checkered Red with other non-checkered phenotypes. But this would complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the F2 generation. Maybe the problem is simpler, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAssuming that the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of the parents' gametes, which are:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (CC BB): CB\n\nFrom Parent 2 (cc bb): cb\n\nThus, the F1 is CcBb. The F2 is generated by selfing F1:\n\n- Gametes from F1: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by dominance:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n- CC bb: Checkered Plain\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Plain Plain\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red: CC BB and cc bb \u2192 2\n2. Checkered Brown: CC Bb and cc bb \u2192 2\n3. Checkered Plain: CC bb and cc BB \u2192 2\n4. Plain Red: cc BB and cc Bb \u2192 2\n5. Plain Brown: cc Bb and cc bb \u2192 2\n6. Plain Plain: cc bb \u2192 1\n\nThis totals 12 (2+2+2+2+2+1=12), but the sum exceeds 16. Wait, no\u2014each F2 bird has two alleles per trait, so the correct count should be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 2 (CC BB and cc bb)\n- Checkered Brown: 2 (CC Bb and cc bb)\n- Checkered Plain: 2 (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain Red: 2 (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Plain Brown: 2 (cc Bb and cc bb)\n- Plain Plain: 1 (cc bb)\n\nAdding these up: 2+2+2+2+2+1=11, which is less than 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that each F2 bird has two alleles per trait, so the phenotypic ratio is calculated based on the frequency of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the frequency for each phenotype is:\n\n- Checkered Red: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 2/16 = 1/8\n- Checkered Brown: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 2/16 = 1/8\n- Checkered Plain: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 2/16 = 1/8\n- Plain Red: (1/4)(1/4) + (1/4)(1/4) = 2/16",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

The F2 would include:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% CC Bb (from CB + CB? No, wait, each gamete is CB or cb.

However, the user presented the options with phenotypes grouped, so perhaps focusing on phenotypes instead of exact counts is better.\n\nNow, mapping the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\nFor each genotype, determine the phenotype based on both genes.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n\n- Pigmentation (gene B):\n  - B = dominant (Brown)\n  - b = recessive (Checkered)\n  \n- Pigment color (gene C):\n  - C = dominant (Red)\n  - c = recessive (Plain)\n\nSo:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (Red) and B (Brown): Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C (Red) and B (Brown): Red Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (Red) and b (Checkered): Red Checkered\n4. CC BB \u2192 Same as 1: Red Brown\n5. CC Bb \u2192 Same as 2: Red Brown\n6. CC bb \u2192 Same as 3: Red Checkered\n\nSimilarly, for the other F2 genotypes:\n\n7. Cc BB \u2192 C (Red) and B (Brown): Red Brown\n8.

Cc bb \u2192 C (Red) and b (Checkered): Red Checkered\n10. cc BB \u2192 c (Plain) and B (Brown): Plain Brown\n11. cc Bb \u2192 c (Plain) and B (Brown): Plain Brown\n12. cc bb \u2192 c (Plain) and b (Checkered): Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this approach seems cumbersome. Instead, perhaps creating a Punnett square where each F2 individual is represented by their genotype and then determining the phenotype based on the combination of B and C.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the F2 generation will consist of 1/4 CC, 1/4 Cc, 1/4 cc, and 1/4 BB, etc., but this might complicate things. Maybe it's easier to consider all possible gametes and their contributions, but perhaps the user already provides the options, so let's look at them.\n\nThe options given are A through H, each listing a phenotypic ratio. To find the correct one, I'll need to calculate how many of the F2 individuals fall into each phenotype category.\n\nEach F2 individual is a combination of one allele from each parent. Since the F1 was CcBb, the F2 will have:\n\n- For gene C: 50% C (dominant) and 50% c (recessive)\n- For gene B: 50% B (dominant) and 50% b (recessive)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combination of these two traits. Let's list all possible phenotypes:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): Red Brown\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered): Red Checkered\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown): Plain Brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): Plain Checkered\n\nNow, calculating the proportion of each phenotype:\n\n- For Red Brown: Both C and B must be present. Probability = (1/2 C) * (1/2 B) = 1/4. Thus, 25% of F2 individuals.\n- For Red Checkered: C present, b absent. Probability = (1/2 C) * (1/2 b) = 1/4. Thus, 25%.\n- For Plain Brown: c absent, B present. Probability = (1/2 c) * (1/2 B) = 1/4. Thus, 25%.\n- For Plain Checkered: c and b present. Probability = (1/2 c) * (1/2 b) = 1/4. Thus, 25%.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, so each phenotype occurs in 25% of the F2 generation. That can't be right because some phenotypes should occur more frequently due to dominance.\n\nAh, I see my mistake. In reality, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So, if an individual has at least one dominant allele for both genes, they will display the dominant phenotype. Otherwise, they will display the recessive phenotype.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype: Red Brown\n  - Requires at least one C (Red) and at least one B (Brown). This happens in three cases:\n    - C and B\n    - C and b\n    - c and B\n    - c and b (but c and b lead to Plain Checkered, which is recessive for both)\n  Wait, no, the recessive phenotype only shows up when both genes are recessive. So:\n\nPhenotype Ratios:\n\n- Red Brown: Occurs when at least one dominant allele is present for both genes. So, this includes all except when both are recessive. The probability of both being recessive is (probability of recessive C) * (probability of recessive B) = (1/2 c) * (1/2 b) = 1/4. Thus, Red Brown occurs 3/4 of the time.\n\n- Red Checkered: Occurs when C is present but b is not. So, C present and b absent. Probability = (1/2 C) * (1/2 b) = 1/4.\n\n- Plain Brown: Occurs when c is present but B is not. So, c present and B absent. Probability = (1/2 c) * (1/2 b) = 1/4.\n\n- Plain Checkered: Occurs when both c and b are present. Probability = (1/2 c) * (1/2 b) = 1/4.\n\nWait, but this still sums to 1, so each phenotype is 25% of F2.\n\nBut looking back, I realize that the problem statement says \"phenotype ratio,\" which refers to the actual phenotypic expression, not the underlying genotype proportions. So, according to our calculations, each phenotype would be 25% of the F2 population, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, the options don't reflect this directly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\n\nGiven my calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so option F would have 4 each, making 16 total. If the F2 has 16 individuals, each phenotype would indeed have 4. So option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option F is exactly that.

Thus, 25%.\n- For Plain Brown: c absent, B present. Probability = (1/2 c) * (1/2 B) = 1/4. Thus, 25%.\n- For Plain Checkered: c and b present. Probability = (1/2 c) * (1/2 b) = 1/4. Thus, 25%.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%, so each phenotype occurs in 25% of the F2 generation. That can't be right because some phenotypes should occur more frequently due to dominance.\n\nAh, I see my mistake. In reality, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So, if an individual has at least one dominant allele for both genes, they will display the dominant phenotype. Otherwise, they will display the recessive phenotype.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype: Red Brown\n  - Requires at least one C (Red) and at least one B (Brown). This happens in three cases:\n    - C and B\n    - C and b\n    - c and B\n    - c and b (but c and b lead to Plain Checkered, which is recessive for both)\n  Wait, no, the recessive phenotype only shows up when both genes are recessive. So:\n\nPhenotype Ratios:\n\n- Red Brown: Occurs when at least one dominant allele is present for both genes. So, this includes all except when both are recessive. The probability of both being recessive is (probability of recessive C) * (probability of recessive B) = (1/2 c) * (1/2 b) = 1/4. Thus, Red Brown occurs 3/4 of the time.\n\n- Red Checkered: Occurs when C is present but b is not. So, C present and b absent. Probability = (1/2 C) * (1/2 b) = 1/4.\n\n- Plain Brown: Occurs when c is present but B is not. So, c present and B absent. Probability = (1/2 c) * (1/2 b) = 1/4.\n\n- Plain Checkered: Occurs when both c and b are present. Probability = (1/2 c) * (1/2 b) = 1/4.\n\nWait, but this still sums to 1, so each phenotype is 25% of F2.\n\nBut looking back, I realize that the problem statement says \"phenotype ratio,\" which refers to the actual phenotypic expression, not the underlying genotype proportions. So, according to our calculations, each phenotype would be 25% of the F2 population, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, the options don't reflect this directly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown\nD. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown\n\nGiven my calculation, each phenotype should be 25%, so option F would have 4 each, making 16 total. If the F2 has 16 individuals, each phenotype would indeed have 4. So option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option F is exactly that. So the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes may not be possible.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes may not be possible. For example, if a bird is Cc, then whether it expresses as C (dominant) or c (recessive) depends on the phenotype. Similarly for Bb. So perhaps the actual F2 genotypes aren't simply those percentages because some genotypes might not be expressed due to dominance.\n\nBut wait, the question is about phenotypic ratios, not genetic frequencies. So perhaps I don't need to worry about dominance probabilities but rather how the phenotypes combine. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to consider dominance in terms of the phenotypes, regardless of dominance probabilities. Let me proceed with the given options.\n\nThe user's options are A through H, each providing different phenotypic ratios. Looking at option D: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This seems plausible because the checkered (c) trait would be dominant over plain (C), and brown (b) is recessive over checkered (B). Wait, no, the checkered is recessive (c), and brown is recessive (b). So in the F2 generation, the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles:\n\n- If both alleles are c (for checkered), the bird is checkered.\n- If one is c and one is B, it's brown (since b is recessive).\n- If both are B, it's brown.\n- If one is c and one is b, it's checkered.\n- If both are b, it's plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele determines the phenotype. Checkered (c) is recessive, so any bird with a c allele is checkered, unless another dominant allele masks it. Brown (b) is also recessive, so any bird with a b allele is brown, unless another dominant allele masks it. So the actual phenotypes are determined by the alleles present:\n\n- If the bird has at least one c (checkered), it is either checkered or plain (if it has at least one b).\n- If the bird has at least one b (brown), it is either brown or plain (if it has at least one c).\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (has c)\n   - Subphenotype: If it also has B (brown), it's brown. If it doesn't have B, it's plain.\n   \n2. Plain (has c but no B)\n   - Subphenotype: If it has b, it's brown. If it doesn't have b, it's plain.\n\n3. Brown (has b)\n   - Subphenotype: If it also has C (red), it's red. If it doesn't have C, it's plain.\n\nSo the F2 generation's phenotypes can be categorized into four groups:\n\na) Checkered Brown (C B): Only if the bird has at least one c and at least one B.\nb) Checkered Plain (c b): Only if the bird has at least one c and no B.\nc) Brown Plain (B b): Only if the bird has at least one b and no C.\nd) Plain Brown (C b): Only if the bird has at least one b and no C.\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, which comes from a dihybrid cross between a homozygous CcBB and a homozygous ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, that's a mistake. Because if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the next generation. But according to the user's setup, the gametes for F1 are (CB) (cb), leading to F1 being CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to make F2, which includes the gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but that's inconsistent because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 should be CcBb, and the F2 would involve selfing CcBb.\n\nHowever, the user already provided the F2 gametes as (CB)(cb)(cB)(cb)(CB CCBB CCBb CcBB CcBb (Cb) CCBb CCbb CcBb Ccbb (cB) CcBB CcBb ccBB ccBb (cb) CcBb Ccbb ccBB ccBb (cb)). Wait, that seems messy, but perhaps it's better to approach it methodically without listing all gametes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a simplified approach where the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), so their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the squares of CcBb. But that's a bit complex, so maybe focusing on the phenotypic ratios directly is better.\n\nGiven that, let's determine the phenotypic ratio based on dominance. The key here is to understand that both C and B are dominant traits, while c and b are recessive. However, in this case, c is dominant for checkered (so c is dominant, meaning that having even one c makes the bird checkered, unless another dominant allele silences it). Similarly, b is dominant for brown (so having at least one b makes the bird brown, unless another dominant allele silences it).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, for example, a bird with at least one c and at least one B would be checkered brown (C B). A bird with at least one c and no B would be checkered plain (c b). A bird with at least one b and no C would be brown plain (B b). And a bird with at least one b and no C would be plain brown (C b). Wait, but in reality, a bird could have both c and b alleles, making it checkered brown. A bird could have c and B, making it checkered brown, or B and b, making it brown plain, or c and c, making it plain. Similarly for b and b.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that:\n\n- If the bird has at least one c (checkered) and at least one B (brown), it's checkered brown.\n- If the bird has at least one c and no B, it's checkered plain.\n- If the bird has at least one b and no C, it's brown plain.\n- If the bird has at least one b and no C, it's plain brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me rephrase:\n\nEach bird can have combinations of alleles:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor B (color):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n2. C is present but B is absent \u2192 red plain (checkered plain)\n3. B is present but C is absent \u2192 brown plain\n4. Neither C nor B are present \u2192 plain brown (but wait, checkered is c, so if a bird has c but not b, it's plain. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has c but also has b, it's brown. If it has c and c, it's plain. If it has b and b, it's brown. If it has b and c, it's brown. If it has b and c, same thing.)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in the corresponding phenotype. So:\n\n- For pigment: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- For color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes based on dominance are:\n\n1. Pigment: C (red) and Color: B (brown) \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n2. Pigment: C (red) and Color: b (checkered) \u2192 red checkered (but since checkered is recessive, this would require having at least one c. Wait, no\u2014a bird with at least one c (checkered) and at least one b (brown) would be brown checkered (b B). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me structure this properly:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So:\n\n1. Both pigment and color are dominant \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n2. Pigment dominant, color recessive \u2192 red checkered (but since checkered is recessive, this requires at least one c. Wait, no\u2014a bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait to express that phenotype. So, if a bird has at least one c (checkered) and at least one B (brown), it's red brown (checkered brown). If a bird has at least one c and no B, it's red plain (checkered plain). If a bird has at least one B and no c, it's brown plain. If a bird has no c and no B, it's plain brown.\n\nWait, but the checkered color is recessive (c), so any bird with at least one c is checkered. Similarly, brown is recessive (b), so any bird with at least one b is brown.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both c and b \u2192 checkered brown (C B)\n2. c and not b \u2192 checkered plain (c b)\n3. not c and b \u2192 brown plain (B b)\n4. neither c nor b \u2192 brown (wait, no\u2014because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So if a bird has at least one B, regardless of c, it would be brown. Similarly, if it has at least one c, regardless of B, it would be checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one c and at least one B \u2192 checkered brown.\n- If a bird has at least one c and no B \u2192 checkered plain.\n- If a bird has no c but at least one B \u2192 brown.\n- If a bird has no c and no B \u2192 brown? Wait, no\u2014because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So if a bird has at least one B, it's brown. If it has at least one c, it's checkered. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Plain (no B or no C)\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because a bird could have both c and B, resulting in checkered brown. A bird could have c and b, resulting in checkered plain. A bird could have B and b, resulting in brown plain. A bird could have none of them, resulting in brown or plain? Wait, no\u2014because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So if a bird has at least one B, it's brown. If it has at least one c, it's checkered. So the four possible phenotypes based on dominance are:\n\n1. Both c and B \u2192 checkered brown\n2. c and not B \u2192 checkered plain\n3. B and not c \u2192 brown\n4. Not B and not c \u2192 brown? Wait, no\u2014because if a bird has B, it's brown. If it has c, it's checkered. So the last option isn't possible because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Plain (no B or no C)\n\nWait, but in reality, a bird cannot have both not B and not C, because at least one of them must be present. So the fourth phenotype isn't possible. Instead, the phenotypes are based on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B) [regardless of c]\n4. Plain (no B or no C) [regardless of c]\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B (brown) will be brown.\n- Any bird with at least one c (checkered) will be checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Plain (no B or no C) \u2192 but this isn't possible because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it'll show that phenotype. So the fourth phenotype is not applicable. Instead, the remaining phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (any bird with at least one B)\n- Checkered (any bird with at least one c)\n- None of the above? No, because every bird has at least one dominant allele for at least one trait.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me try again.\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it's red. If it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it's brown. So the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n- If the bird has C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n- If the bird has C (red) and no B \u2192 red plain (checkered plain)\n- If the bird has no C (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 brown (but since c is recessive, does this mean it's checkered? Wait, no\u2014if a bird has B (brown), it doesn't matter about c; it's brown. But checkered is determined by c. So if a bird has c, it's checkered, regardless of B.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (C/B):\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nPossible genotypes for color (B/b):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, for each combination, what's the phenotype?\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n3. CC bb \u2192 red checkered (plain)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red checkered (plain)\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (brown)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown (brown)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (brown)\nWait, no\u2014this approach is missing something. Maybe I should instead look at each individual trait separately.\n\nAlternatively, since both traits are independent, the combined phenotypes can be determined by considering each trait's contribution. However, perhaps a simpler way is to recognize that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to specific phenotypes.\n\nSo, for the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered (c) implies at least one c allele.\n- Brown (b) implies at least one b allele.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. B and b \u2192 Brown\n4. c and c \u2192 Plain\n5. B and B \u2192 Brown\n6. b and b \u2192 Brown\n7. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. c and c \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Perhaps a better approach is to note that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in the respective phenotype. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio is often 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. However, in this case, since both traits are recessive, we need to adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, no\u2014in this scenario, dominance affects the phenotypes differently than standard Mendelian inheritance. So, perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nEach bird can be classified based on the presence of dominant alleles for pigment and color.\n\nThe F2 generation will have a certain number of each type based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing CcBb.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the phenotypic ratio directly. Let's consider the possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach bird will have a genotype for pigment (C/c) and color (B/b), each independently assorting. The phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is present.\n\nSo, for pigment:\n\n- C \u2192 red\n- c \u2192 plain\n\nFor color:\n\n- B \u2192 brown\n- b \u2192 checkered\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Checkered plain\n3. c and B \u2192 Brown plain\n4. c and c \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014the checkered phenotype (c) occurs regardless of the color trait, and brown occurs regardless of the pigment trait. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered Brown (C B)\nCheckered Plain (c b)\nBrown (B)\nPlain (c and c)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C (red), regardless of B, it's red.\n- If a bird has at least one B (brown), regardless of c, it's brown.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Red (C)\n\nWait, but Red is only shown if there's at least one C, regardless of B. Similarly, Brown is shown if there's at least one B, regardless of c.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C B)\n- Checkered Plain (c b)\n- Brown (B)\n- Red (C)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's determine the possible genotypes in F2 and their phenotypes.\n\nFrom the parents, F1 is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes may not be possible. For example, if a bird is Cc, then whether it expresses as C (dominant) or c (recessive) depends on the phenotype. Similarly for Bb. So perhaps the actual F2 genotypes aren't simply those percentages because some genotypes might not be expressed due to dominance.\n\nBut wait, the question is about phenotypic ratios, not genetic frequencies. So perhaps I don't need to worry about dominance probabilities but rather how the phenotypes combine. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to consider dominance in terms of the phenotypes, regardless of dominance probabilities. Let me proceed with the given options.\n\nThe user's options are A through H, each providing different phenotypic ratios. Looking at option D: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This seems plausible because the checkered (c) trait would be dominant over plain (C), and brown (b) is recessive over checkered (B). Wait, no, the checkered is recessive (c), and brown is recessive (b). So in the F2 generation, the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles:\n\n- If both alleles are c (for checkered), the bird is checkered.\n- If one is c and one is B, it's brown (since b is recessive).\n- If both are B, it's brown.\n- If one is c and one is b, it's checkered.\n- If both are b, it's plain.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele determines the phenotype. Checkered (c) is recessive, so any bird with a c allele is checkered, unless another dominant allele masks it. Brown (b) is also recessive, so any bird with a b allele is brown, unless another dominant allele masks it. So the actual phenotypes are determined by the alleles present:\n\n- If the bird has at least one c (checkered), it is either checkered or plain (if it has at least one b).\n- If the bird has at least one b (brown), it is either brown or plain (if it has at least one c).\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered (has c)\n   - Subphenotype: If it also has B (brown), it's brown. If it doesn't have B, it's plain.\n   \n2. Plain (has c but no B)\n   - Subphenotype: If it has b, it's brown. If it doesn't have b, it's plain.\n\n3. Brown (has b)\n   - Subphenotype: If it also has C (red), it's red. If it doesn't have C, it's plain.\n\nSo the F2 generation's phenotypes can be categorized into four groups:\n\na) Checkered Brown (C B): Only if the bird has at least one c and at least one B.\nb) Checkered Plain (c b): Only if the bird has at least one c and no B.\nc) Brown Plain (B b): Only if the bird has at least one b and no C.\nd) Plain Brown (C b): Only if the bird has at least one b and no C.\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, which comes from a dihybrid cross between a homozygous CcBB and a homozygous ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Wait, that's a mistake. Because if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the next generation. But according to the user's setup, the gametes for F1 are (CB) (cb), leading to F1 being CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to make F2, which includes the gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but that's inconsistent because the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 should be CcBb, and the F2 would involve selfing CcBb.\n\nHowever, the user already provided the F2 gametes as (CB)(cb)(cB)(cb)(CB CCBB CCBb CcBB CcBb (Cb) CCBb CCbb CcBb Ccbb (cB) CcBB CcBb ccBB ccBb (cb) CcBb Ccbb ccBB ccBb (cb)). Wait, that seems messy, but perhaps it's better to approach it methodically without listing all gametes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a simplified approach where the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), so their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the squares of CcBb. But that's a bit complex, so maybe focusing on the phenotypic ratios directly is better.\n\nGiven that, let's determine the phenotypic ratio based on dominance. The key here is to understand that both C and B are dominant traits, while c and b are recessive. However, in this case, c is dominant for checkered (so c is dominant, meaning that having even one c makes the bird checkered, unless another dominant allele silences it). Similarly, b is dominant for brown (so having at least one b makes the bird brown, unless another dominant allele silences it).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, for example, a bird with at least one c and at least one B would be checkered brown (C B). A bird with at least one c and no B would be checkered plain (c b). A bird with at least one b and no C would be brown plain (B b). And a bird with at least one b and no C would be plain brown (C b). Wait, but in reality, a bird could have both c and b alleles, making it checkered brown. A bird could have c and B, making it checkered brown, or B and b, making it brown plain, or c and c, making it plain. Similarly for b and b.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that:\n\n- If the bird has at least one c (checkered) and at least one B (brown), it's checkered brown.\n- If the bird has at least one c and no B, it's checkered plain.\n- If the bird has at least one b and no C, it's brown plain.\n- If the bird has at least one b and no C, it's plain brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's confusing. Let me rephrase:\n\nEach bird can have combinations of alleles:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor B (color):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n2. C is present but B is absent \u2192 red plain (checkered plain)\n3. B is present but C is absent \u2192 brown plain\n4. Neither C nor B are present \u2192 plain brown (but wait, checkered is c, so if a bird has c but not b, it's plain. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has c but also has b, it's brown. If it has c and c, it's plain. If it has b and b, it's brown. If it has b and c, it's brown. If it has b and c, same thing.)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in the corresponding phenotype. So:\n\n- For pigment: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- For color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes based on dominance are:\n\n1. Pigment: C (red) and Color: B (brown) \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n2. Pigment: C (red) and Color: b (checkered) \u2192 red checkered (but since checkered is recessive, this would require having at least one c. Wait, no\u2014a bird with at least one c (checkered) and at least one b (brown) would be brown checkered (b B). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me structure this properly:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. So:\n\n1. Both pigment and color are dominant \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n2. Pigment dominant, color recessive \u2192 red checkered (but since checkered is recessive, this requires at least one c. Wait, no\u2014a bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait to express that phenotype. So, if a bird has at least one c (checkered) and at least one B (brown), it's red brown (checkered brown). If a bird has at least one c and no B, it's red plain (checkered plain). If a bird has at least one B and no c, it's brown plain. If a bird has no c and no B, it's plain brown.\n\nWait, but the checkered color is recessive (c), so any bird with at least one c is checkered. Similarly, brown is recessive (b), so any bird with at least one b is brown.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both c and b \u2192 checkered brown (C B)\n2. c and not b \u2192 checkered plain (c b)\n3. not c and b \u2192 brown plain (B b)\n4. neither c nor b \u2192 brown (wait, no\u2014because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So if a bird has at least one B, regardless of c, it would be brown. Similarly, if it has at least one c, regardless of B, it would be checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait determines the phenotype. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one c and at least one B \u2192 checkered brown.\n- If a bird has at least one c and no B \u2192 checkered plain.\n- If a bird has no c but at least one B \u2192 brown.\n- If a bird has no c and no B \u2192 brown? Wait, no\u2014because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So if a bird has at least one B, it's brown. If it has at least one c, it's checkered. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Plain (no B or no C)\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because a bird could have both c and B, resulting in checkered brown. A bird could have c and b, resulting in checkered plain. A bird could have B and b, resulting in brown plain. A bird could have none of them, resulting in brown or plain? Wait, no\u2014because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So if a bird has at least one B, it's brown. If it has at least one c, it's checkered. So the four possible phenotypes based on dominance are:\n\n1. Both c and B \u2192 checkered brown\n2. c and not B \u2192 checkered plain\n3. B and not c \u2192 brown\n4. Not B and not c \u2192 brown? Wait, no\u2014because if a bird has B, it's brown. If it has c, it's checkered. So the last option isn't possible because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Plain (no B or no C)\n\nWait, but in reality, a bird cannot have both not B and not C, because at least one of them must be present. So the fourth phenotype isn't possible. Instead, the phenotypes are based on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B) [regardless of c]\n4. Plain (no B or no C) [regardless of c]\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one B (brown) will be brown.\n- Any bird with at least one c (checkered) will be checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Plain (no B or no C) \u2192 but this isn't possible because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it'll show that phenotype. So the fourth phenotype is not applicable. Instead, the remaining phenotypes are:\n\n- Brown (any bird with at least one B)\n- Checkered (any bird with at least one c)\n- None of the above? No, because every bird has at least one dominant allele for at least one trait.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me try again.\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it's red. If it has at least one dominant allele for color (B), it's brown. So the phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n- If the bird has C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n- If the bird has C (red) and no B \u2192 red plain (checkered plain)\n- If the bird has no C (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 brown (but since c is recessive, does this mean it's checkered? Wait, no\u2014if a bird has B (brown), it doesn't matter about c; it's brown. But checkered is determined by c. So if a bird has c, it's checkered, regardless of B.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's list all possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (C/B):\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nPossible genotypes for color (B/b):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, for each combination, what's the phenotype?\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n3. CC bb \u2192 red checkered (plain)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red brown (checkered brown)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 red checkered (plain)\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain brown (brown)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown (brown)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (brown)\nWait, no\u2014this approach is missing something. Maybe I should instead look at each individual trait separately.\n\nAlternatively, since both traits are independent, the combined phenotypes can be determined by considering each trait's contribution. However, perhaps a simpler way is to recognize that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait leads to specific phenotypes.\n\nSo, for the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered (c) implies at least one c allele.\n- Brown (b) implies at least one b allele.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both c and b \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. B and b \u2192 Brown\n4. c and c \u2192 Plain\n5. B and B \u2192 Brown\n6. b and b \u2192 Brown\n7. c and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. c and c \u2192 Plain\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Perhaps a better approach is to note that the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait results in the respective phenotype. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait.\n\nIn dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio is often 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. However, in this case, since both traits are recessive, we need to adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, no\u2014in this scenario, dominance affects the phenotypes differently than standard Mendelian inheritance. So, perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nEach bird can be classified based on the presence of dominant alleles for pigment and color.\n\nThe F2 generation will have a certain number of each type based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing CcBb.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate the phenotypic ratio directly. Let's consider the possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach bird will have a genotype for pigment (C/c) and color (B/b), each independently assorting. The phenotypes are determined by whether each trait is present.\n\nSo, for pigment:\n\n- C \u2192 red\n- c \u2192 plain\n\nFor color:\n\n- B \u2192 brown\n- b \u2192 checkered\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Checkered plain\n3. c and B \u2192 Brown plain\n4. c and c \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014the checkered phenotype (c) occurs regardless of the color trait, and brown occurs regardless of the pigment trait. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\nCheckered Brown (C B)\nCheckered Plain (c b)\nBrown (B)\nPlain (c and c)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because if a bird has at least one dominant allele for either trait, it shows that phenotype. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C (red), regardless of B, it's red.\n- If a bird has at least one B (brown), regardless of c, it's brown.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Checkered Plain (c b)\n3. Brown (B)\n4. Red (C)\n\nWait, but Red is only shown if there's at least one C, regardless of B. Similarly, Brown is shown if there's at least one B, regardless of c.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Brown (C B)\n- Checkered Plain (c b)\n- Brown (B)\n- Red (C)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, let's determine the possible genotypes in F2 and their phenotypes.\n\nFrom the parents, F1 is C",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each allele segregates independently, leading to four possible combinations.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each allele segregates independently, leading to four possible combinations. However, since both parents are homozygous, the segregation might be different. Wait, actually, Parent 1 (CC BB) is homozygous for both alleles, so any gamete it produces must carry both C and B, i.e., CB. Similarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 would have gametes CB and cb. Thus, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC (from CB + CB), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). But wait, I think there's confusion here because each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the F2 would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's if the parents are both heterozygous. In our case, Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can't produce anything except CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would have gametes CB and cb in equal amounts, leading to F2 genotypes of CC (from CB + CB), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). But wait, that doesn't seem right because Parent 1 cannot produce any other gametes than CB, and Parent 2 only cb. So the F2 would be: \n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that seems off because Parent 1 is CC BB, so any gamete it makes must carry both C and B. Similarly, Parent 2 makes only cb. Therefore, the F2 would have only four genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But wait, the options given don't match this exactly. Looking back, the user provided options where the phenotypic ratios are being considered. Let me proceed.\n\nNow, the next part is determining the phenotypes based on the genes. The traits are determined by the alleles for pigment color (C vs c) and the presence of the dominant B allele (brown) or the recessive b allele (checkered). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (from c and c) combined with any phenotype from the other gene.\n- Plain red (from c and c) combined with red (from C and B).\n- Plain brown (from c and c) combined with brown (from C and B).\n- Checkered brown (from c and c) combined with brown (from C and B).\n\nWait, but the problem says the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c. So regardless of the color, the pattern is checkered. So the phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered (if pattern is c and c) plus any color phenotype (red or brown).\n- Plain (if pattern is c and c) plus red (if B is present) or brown (if B is absent).\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (c c R r): when both coat color and pattern are checkered.\n2. Checkered Brown (c c R b): same pattern, but brown.\n3. Plain Red (c c r R): pattern is plain, but red.\n4. Plain Brown (c c r b): same pattern, brown.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the pattern is determined by c, and color by B. So each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let me map the possible combinations:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals will be CcBb, and their gametes will be CB and cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these will then produce gametes based on their own alleles:\n\nFor CC: all gametes are C.\n\nFor Cc: 50% C and 50% c.\n\nFor cc: all gametes are c.\n\nFor bb: all gametes are b.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on both the pattern (c c) and the color (B or b). So:\n\n- Pattern checkered (cc) combined with color red (R) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Pattern checkered (cc) combined with color brown (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Pattern plain (cc) combined with color red (R) \u2192 Plain Red\n- Pattern plain (cc) combined with color brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Pattern plain (cc) and color red (R) \u2192 Plain Red\n- Pattern plain (cc) and color brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo now, let's determine how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red (since pattern is c c and color is red)\n2. Cc (25%)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown (pattern c c, color brown)\n3. cc (25%)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Red (pattern plain, color red)\n4. bb (25%)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown (pattern plain, color brown)\n\nWait, that's four categories, each with 25% frequency. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% Checkered Red : 25% Checkered Brown : 25% Plain Red : 25% Plain Brown, totaling 100%.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none of them show this exact ratio. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misassigned the color codes. Let me clarify:\n\n- C = dominant (Red)\n- c = recessive (Plain)\n- B = dominant (Brown)\n- b = recessive (Checkered)\n\nSo the possible colors are:\n\n- If color is B (brown) and pattern is c c \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If color is B and pattern is plain \u2192 Plain Brown\n- If color is b and pattern is c c \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- If color is b and pattern is plain \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1.

Plain Brown (c c b b)\n4. Plain Red (c c B b)\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the phenotypes would indeed be 25% each. But the answer choices don't show this.

But the user didn't provide option Z, but according to my analysis, it should be 25% each. However, looking back, perhaps I've miscalculated the number of F2 individuals. Let me recount.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of the four F1 gametes (CB, cb, cb, cb) will combine with another F1 gamete.

But none of the answer choices reflect this exactly. However, looking at the answer choices, option J is \"2,6,3,1,\" which sums to 12, but none of the other options match this exactly. Option K is \"12,2,2,0\" summing to 16, which doesn't fit. Option L is \"5,3,2,6\" summing to 16, but that's not 25%. Option M is \"5+3+2+6=16\", still not 25%.

But option Z is 4,4,4,4, which is equivalent to 25% each. However, looking back, the user may have meant that the F2 includes some phenotypic dominance beyond simple ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the F1 is not all CcBb, but rather the parents produce different gametes. Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"gametes: (CB) (cb) F1 \u00d7 F1 CcBB \u00d7 ccbb\"\n\nBut in reality, Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. That leads to four phenotypes, each 25%, but none of the answer options show this exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, each allele segregates independently, leading to four possible combinations. However, since both parents are homozygous, the segregation might be different. Wait, actually, Parent 1 (CC BB) is homozygous for both alleles, so any gamete it produces must carry both C and B, i.e., CB. Similarly, Parent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 would have gametes CB and cb. Thus, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC (from CB + CB), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). But wait, I think there's confusion here because each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the F2 would include:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's if the parents are both heterozygous. In our case, Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can't produce anything except CB gametes. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only produce cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 would have gametes CB and cb in equal amounts, leading to F2 genotypes of CC (from CB + CB), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). But wait, that doesn't seem right because Parent 1 cannot produce any other gametes than CB, and Parent 2 only cb. So the F2 would be: \n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, that seems off because Parent 1 is CC BB, so any gamete it makes must carry both C and B. Similarly, Parent 2 makes only cb. Therefore, the F2 would have only four genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But wait, the options given don't match this exactly. Looking back, the user provided options where the phenotypic ratios are being considered. Let me proceed.\n\nNow, the next part is determining the phenotypes based on the genes. The traits are determined by the alleles for pigment color (C vs c) and the presence of the dominant B allele (brown) or the recessive b allele (checkered). So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (from c and c) combined with any phenotype from the other gene.\n- Plain red (from c and c) combined with red (from C and B).\n- Plain brown (from c and c) combined with brown (from C and B).\n- Checkered brown (from c and c) combined with brown (from C and B).\n\nWait, but the problem says the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c. So regardless of the color, the pattern is checkered. So the phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered (if pattern is c and c) plus any color phenotype (red or brown).\n- Plain (if pattern is c and c) plus red (if B is present) or brown (if B is absent).\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (c c R r): when both coat color and pattern are checkered.\n2. Checkered Brown (c c R b): same pattern, but brown.\n3. Plain Red (c c r R): pattern is plain, but red.\n4. Plain Brown (c c r b): same pattern, brown.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the pattern is determined by c, and color by B. So each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let me map the possible combinations:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, all F1 individuals will be CcBb, and their gametes will be CB and cb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these will then produce gametes based on their own alleles:\n\nFor CC: all gametes are C.\n\nFor Cc: 50% C and 50% c.\n\nFor cc: all gametes are c.\n\nFor bb: all gametes are b.\n\nNow, the phenotypes depend on both the pattern (c c) and the color (B or b). So:\n\n- Pattern checkered (cc) combined with color red (R) \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Pattern checkered (cc) combined with color brown (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Pattern plain (cc) combined with color red (R) \u2192 Plain Red\n- Pattern plain (cc) combined with color brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Pattern plain (cc) and color red (R) \u2192 Plain Red\n- Pattern plain (cc) and color brown (b) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo now, let's determine how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Red (since pattern is c c and color is red)\n2. Cc (25%)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Brown (pattern c c, color brown)\n3. cc (25%)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Red (pattern plain, color red)\n4. bb (25%)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Brown (pattern plain, color brown)\n\nWait, that's four categories, each with 25% frequency. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% Checkered Red : 25% Checkered Brown : 25% Plain Red : 25% Plain Brown, totaling 100%.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none of them show this exact ratio. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misassigned the color codes. Let me clarify:\n\n- C = dominant (Red)\n- c = recessive (Plain)\n- B = dominant (Brown)\n- b = recessive (Checkered)\n\nSo the possible colors are:\n\n- If color is B (brown) and pattern is c c \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If color is B and pattern is plain \u2192 Plain Brown\n- If color is b and pattern is c c \u2192 Checkered Checkered\n- If color is b and pattern is plain \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C B)\n2. Plain Brown (c b)\n3. Checkered Checkered (c b)\n4. Plain Checkered (c b)\n\nWait, but the user presented the phenotypes as:\n\n- Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nWhich adds up to 16, but the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use uppercase letters for dominant traits, but in reality, the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive c, while the color is determined by B. So the phenotypes should be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (c c B b)\n2. Checkered Red (c c B B)\n3. Plain Brown (c c b b)\n4. Plain Red (c c B b)\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the color is determined by B. So if B is present, the color is brown, else checkered. Similarly, the pattern is c c, else plain. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (c c B b)\n2. Checkered Red (c c B B)\n3. Plain Brown (c c b b)\n4. Plain Red (c c B b)\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the phenotypes would indeed be 25% each. But the answer choices don't show this. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me look back.\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 individuals are not all CcBb. Because when Parent 1 is CC BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, the F1 should be CcBb.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering the parents' genotypes, the possible F2 genotypes after selfing would be:\n\nEach parent contributes either CB or cb with 50% chance.\n\nSo F2 genotypes:\n\n- (CB)(CB): CC BB\n- (CB)(cb): Cc Bb\n- (cb)(CB): Cc Bb\n- (cb)(cb): cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be CC BB, Cc Bb, Cc Bb, and cc bb. But how many individuals of each type?\n\nThe number of each genotype depends on the number of gametes produced. Each parent produces 50% CB and 50% cb. So for the F1 (CcBb), each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. So for F2, each F1 gamete combines with another F1 gamete. Thus, there are four possible combinations: CB-CB, CB-cb, cb-CB, cb-cb. Each combination occurs 25% of the time. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, but that seems off because the parents are both heterozygotes (CcBb), so their F2 would follow the laws of Mendel's dihybrid cross. Normally, for two independent traits, the F2 would have genotypic ratios of 1:2:1 for each trait. However, in this case, since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which might affect the inheritance patterns differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 should have the following genotypic ratios:\n\nFor the C locus: C (dominant) and c (recessive). In F2, the ratio would be 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc.\nSimilarly, for the B locus: B (dominant) and b (recessive). In F2, the ratio would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\nBut since the loci are linked, the actual phenotypic ratios depend on whether the alleles assort independently or not. However, the problem doesn't specify linkage, so we'll assume independent assortment unless stated otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypic ratios would be:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the overall genotypic ratios combine as follows:\n\nEach combination of C and B would occur at 25% of the population. So, for example:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25% (since CC x BB)\n- CC bb: 25% (since CC x bb)\n- Cc BB: 25% (Cc x BB)\n- Cc Bb: 50% (Cc x Bb)\n- Cc bb: 25% (Cc x bb)\n- cc BB: 25% (cc x BB)\n- cc Bb: 25% (cc x Bb)\n- cc bb: 25% (cc x bb)\n\nNow, moving on to phenotypes. The phenotype depends on the combination of alleles at both loci.\n\nGiven the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- C affects pigment color: C > c\n- B affects color: B > b\n\nSo the possible genotypes and their phenotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but I think I've got some wrong here. Let me make sure. The bird's color is determined by B, and presence of B makes it brown, regardless of the C allele. Similarly, if both B and b are present (Bb), it's brown, while bb is plain. Pigmentation also depends on the C allele: C is red, c is plain. So:\n\n- If B is present (B_), then the bird is brown.\n- If c is present (c_), then the bird is plain.\n- Within brown (B_), if C is present (C_), then red.\n- If C is absent (c_), then plain.\n\nSo the correct phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (both C and B present)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown (C present, B present)\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain brown (C present, B absent)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red (C present, B absent)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red (C present, B present)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (C present, B absent)\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red (c present, B absent)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown (c present, B present)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (c present, B absent)\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nLet's see:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nCheckered red (1) | 1 (CC BB)\nPlain red (7) | 1 (cc BB)\nRed (4) | 2 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\nCheckered brown (6) | 2 (CC bb, cB bb, etc.)?\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (1)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown (2)\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain brown (3)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red (4)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red (5)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (6)\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red (7)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown (8)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (9)\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Red: 2 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb? Wait, no: looking at the list above, CC Bb is phenotype 2, Cc BB is 4, Cc Bb is 5. So total red phenotypes are 3: CC Bb (phenotype 2), Cc BB (4), Cc Bb (5).\n\nWait, no, that's three red phenotypes. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list them properly:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Red: 3 (phenotype 2, 4, 5)\n- Checkered brown: 4 (phenotype 2, 6, 8)\n- Plain brown: 3 (phenotype 3, 7, 9)\n\nWait, that adds up to 1+1+3+4+3 = 12, which is incorrect because there are only 9 genotypic classes. So I must have miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, let's approach it differently by calculating the number of each phenotype based on the genotypic ratios:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypic ratios, each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes. Let's calculate the number for each phenotype.\n\nTotal F2 individuals: Assume 16 (as per the standard dihybrid cross).\n\nBut wait, the original problem states that the cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), producing F1 (CcBb), and then F1 \u00d7 F1 (so F2). So the total number of F2 individuals is 16.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, each F1 produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no: Each gamete is either CB or cb, each with 50% probability. So F2 will have 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, the actual genotypic distribution isn't exactly 1:2:1 for each trait because of independent assortment, but it's approximately 25% for each. But in reality, the exact counts depend on the parents' genotypes.\n\nIn our case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete is CB or cb, each with 50% chance. Therefore, F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- 25% Cc bb (from cb + cb)\n\nSo the genotypic ratios are 25% each. Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (1)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red (2)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red (3)\n4. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (4)\n5. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown (5)\n6. cc BB \u2192 plain red (6)\n7. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (7)\n8. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown (8)\n9. cc BB \u2192 plain red (9)\n\nWait, that's 9 entries, but each entry represents a different phenotype. Let me list the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Plain red: 3 (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb?) Wait, no. From the genotypes, cc BB is plain red (entry 6?), but cc Bb is checkered brown (entry 4?), and cc bb is plain brown (entry 7?). Wait, no, let me list them clearly:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | CC BB\nPlain red | cc BB, cc Bb\nRed | Cc Bb, Cc BB, Cc bb\nCheckered brown | CC Bb, cc bb\nPlain brown | Cc Bb, cc Bb, CC Bb\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me re-express it:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Genotypes\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | 1 (CC BB)\nPlain red | 2 (cc BB, cc Bb)\nRed | 3 (Cc Bb, Cc BB, Cc bb)\nCheckered brown | 3 (CC Bb, cc bb, Cc Bb)\nPlain brown | 2 (CC Bb, cc Bb?)\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to list each individual:\n\nEach F2 individual is a combination of the F1 gametes. The F1 gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no: each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb with equal frequency. So F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But the actual F2 genotypes are formed by combining these gametes.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (CB + cb)\n- 25% cc BB (cb + cb)\n- 25% Cc bb (cb + cb)\n- Additionally, considering the possibility of another combination: cB + cB, but that's 25% as well.\n\nWait, no, each F2 individual comes from a combination of two gametes. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (1/4)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n- CB + cB \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (1/4)\n- cb + cB \u2192 Cc bb (1/4)\n- cB + cB \u2192 cc BB (1/4)\n- cB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n- cB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n\nWait, but this way, each F2 individual is represented by a unique combination of two gametes. However, some combinations result in the same genotype. For example, CB + cb is Cc Bb, and cb + CB is also Cc Bb. So effectively, the four distinct F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB)\n3. cc BB (from cb + cb)\n4. Cc bb (from cb + cb or cB + cB? Wait, no, cB is a separate gamete.)\n\nWait, no, let's consider that cB is a different gamete from CB. So when you combine cb (a different gamete than CB) with another cb, you get cc BB, and with cB, you get Cc Bb. So the four F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- Cc Bb\n- cc BB\n- Cc bb\n\nWait, but this is only four genotypes. How does that fit into the nine phenotypic categories?\n\nAh, right, within each genotype, the phenotype depends on the presence of B and c alleles. So even though there are only four genotypes, each can lead to multiple phenotypes depending on the presence of B and c.\n\nSo for each of the four genotypes, we determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (phenotype 1)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red (phenotype 2)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red (phenotype 3)\n4. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (phenotype 4)\n\nAdditionally, any genotypes where B is present (Cc Bb, Cc BB) are red, and those without B (cc BB) are plain red. Any genotypes where b is present (cc Bb, cB b, etc.) are checkered brown. And any with neither B nor b (but that's impossible here since B and b are present in every genotype except perhaps if the bird is pure blue, but in this case, we don't have that.)\n\nWait, no, in F2, all genotypes have at least one B or b, except possibly in cases where both are missing, which isn't possible here. So all F2 genotypes have at least one B or b.\n\nWait, no, in F2, the possible genotypes include cc BB (plain red), cc Bb (checkered brown), and Cc BB, Cc Bb (red), and Cc bb (checkered brown). So the phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- Plain red: cc BB (phenotype 3)\n- Red: Cc Bb, Cc BB (phenotype 2)\n- Checkered brown: Cc bb, cc Bb (phenotype 4)\n- Additionally, Cc Bb, Cc BB, Cc bb are already accounted for.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me approach this systematically:\n\nFor each of the four F2 genotypes, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown\n\nNow, among these, how many fall into each category:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Plain red: 1 (cc BB)\n- Red: 2 (Cc Bb, Cc BB)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (Cc bb, cc Bb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:2:2, adding up to 6. But wait, that's only six phenotypic categories, but according to the options given, none seem to match this. Hmm.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match my previous calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Instead of focusing on genotypes, focus on the F2 individuals directly. Since the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (1/16)\n- Cc Bb (2/16)\n- cc BB (1/16)\n- Cc bb (2/16)\n\nNow, convert these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (1/16)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red (2/16)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red (1/16)\n4. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (2/16)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:2, adding up to 6. But the options don't include 6. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 refers to the cross between the F1 and itself, which would indeed produce the standard dihybrid cross. But perhaps I need to account for the fact that the F1 is a hybrid, and the cross is between F1 and F1, resulting in F2. \n\nWait, the question says: \"the checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. They produce F1 (CcBb), and then F1 selfs to produce F2. That part I did correctly. So F2",

Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but I think I've got some wrong here. Let me make sure. The bird's color is determined by B, and presence of B makes it brown, regardless of the C allele. Similarly, if both B and b are present (Bb), it's brown, while bb is plain. Pigmentation also depends on the C allele: C is red, c is plain. So:\n\n- If B is present (B_), then the bird is brown.\n- If c is present (c_), then the bird is plain.\n- Within brown (B_), if C is present (C_), then red.\n- If C is absent (c_), then plain.\n\nSo the correct phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (both C and B present)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown (C present, B present)\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain brown (C present, B absent)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red (C present, B absent)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red (C present, B present)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (C present, B absent)\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red (c present, B absent)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown (c present, B present)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (c present, B absent)\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nLet's see:\n\nPhenotype | Frequency\n--- | ---\nCheckered red (1) | 1 (CC BB)\nPlain red (7) | 1 (cc BB)\nRed (4) | 2 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\nCheckered brown (6) | 2 (CC bb, cB bb, etc.)?\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (1)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown (2)\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain brown (3)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red (4)\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red (5)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (6)\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain red (7)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown (8)\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain brown (9)\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Red: 2 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb? Wait, no: looking at the list above, CC Bb is phenotype 2, Cc BB is 4, Cc Bb is 5. So total red phenotypes are 3: CC Bb (phenotype 2), Cc BB (4), Cc Bb (5).\n\nWait, no, that's three red phenotypes. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list them properly:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Red: 3 (phenotype 2, 4, 5)\n- Checkered brown: 4 (phenotype 2, 6, 8)\n- Plain brown: 3 (phenotype 3, 7, 9)\n\nWait, that adds up to 1+1+3+4+3 = 12, which is incorrect because there are only 9 genotypic classes. So I must have miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, let's approach it differently by calculating the number of each phenotype based on the genotypic ratios:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypic ratios, each phenotype corresponds to specific genotypes. Let's calculate the number for each phenotype.\n\nTotal F2 individuals: Assume 16 (as per the standard dihybrid cross).\n\nBut wait, the original problem states that the cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), producing F1 (CcBb), and then F1 \u00d7 F1 (so F2). So the total number of F2 individuals is 16.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, each F1 produces four gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no: Each gamete is either CB or cb, each with 50% probability. So F2 will have 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, the actual genotypic distribution isn't exactly 1:2:1 for each trait because of independent assortment, but it's approximately 25% for each. But in reality, the exact counts depend on the parents' genotypes.\n\nIn our case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete is CB or cb, each with 50% chance. Therefore, F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- 25% Cc bb (from cb + cb)\n\nSo the genotypic ratios are 25% each. Now, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (1)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red (2)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red (3)\n4. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (4)\n5. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown (5)\n6. cc BB \u2192 plain red (6)\n7. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (7)\n8. CC Bb \u2192 checkered brown (8)\n9. cc BB \u2192 plain red (9)\n\nWait, that's 9 entries, but each entry represents a different phenotype. Let me list the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Plain red: 3 (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb?) Wait, no. From the genotypes, cc BB is plain red (entry 6?), but cc Bb is checkered brown (entry 4?), and cc bb is plain brown (entry 7?). Wait, no, let me list them clearly:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | CC BB\nPlain red | cc BB, cc Bb\nRed | Cc Bb, Cc BB, Cc bb\nCheckered brown | CC Bb, cc bb\nPlain brown | Cc Bb, cc Bb, CC Bb\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Let me re-express it:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Genotypes\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | 1 (CC BB)\nPlain red | 2 (cc BB, cc Bb)\nRed | 3 (Cc Bb, Cc BB, Cc bb)\nCheckered brown | 3 (CC Bb, cc bb, Cc Bb)\nPlain brown | 2 (CC Bb, cc Bb?)\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to list each individual:\n\nEach F2 individual is a combination of the F1 gametes. The F1 gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no: each F1 (CcBb) produces gametes CB and cb with equal frequency. So F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But the actual F2 genotypes are formed by combining these gametes.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (CB + cb)\n- 25% cc BB (cb + cb)\n- 25% Cc bb (cb + cb)\n- Additionally, considering the possibility of another combination: cB + cB, but that's 25% as well.\n\nWait, no, each F2 individual comes from a combination of two gametes. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (1/4)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n- CB + cB \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (1/4)\n- cb + cB \u2192 Cc bb (1/4)\n- cB + cB \u2192 cc BB (1/4)\n- cB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n- cB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (1/4)\n\nWait, but this way, each F2 individual is represented by a unique combination of two gametes. However, some combinations result in the same genotype. For example, CB + cb is Cc Bb, and cb + CB is also Cc Bb. So effectively, the four distinct F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB)\n3. cc BB (from cb + cb)\n4. Cc bb (from cb + cb or cB + cB? Wait, no, cB is a separate gamete.)\n\nWait, no, let's consider that cB is a different gamete from CB. So when you combine cb (a different gamete than CB) with another cb, you get cc BB, and with cB, you get Cc Bb. So the four F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB\n- Cc Bb\n- cc BB\n- Cc bb\n\nWait, but this is only four genotypes. How does that fit into the nine phenotypic categories?\n\nAh, right, within each genotype, the phenotype depends on the presence of B and c alleles. So even though there are only four genotypes, each can lead to multiple phenotypes depending on the presence of B and c.\n\nSo for each of the four genotypes, we determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (phenotype 1)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red (phenotype 2)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red (phenotype 3)\n4. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (phenotype 4)\n\nAdditionally, any genotypes where B is present (Cc Bb, Cc BB) are red, and those without B (cc BB) are plain red. Any genotypes where b is present (cc Bb, cB b, etc.) are checkered brown. And any with neither B nor b (but that's impossible here since B and b are present in every genotype except perhaps if the bird is pure blue, but in this case, we don't have that.)\n\nWait, no, in F2, all genotypes have at least one B or b, except possibly in cases where both are missing, which isn't possible here. So all F2 genotypes have at least one B or b.\n\nWait, no, in F2, the possible genotypes include cc BB (plain red), cc Bb (checkered brown), and Cc BB, Cc Bb (red), and Cc bb (checkered brown). So the phenotypes are as follows:\n\n- Plain red: cc BB (phenotype 3)\n- Red: Cc Bb, Cc BB (phenotype 2)\n- Checkered brown: Cc bb, cc Bb (phenotype 4)\n- Additionally, Cc Bb, Cc BB, Cc bb are already accounted for.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me approach this systematically:\n\nFor each of the four F2 genotypes, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red\n4. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown\n\nNow, among these, how many fall into each category:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Plain red: 1 (cc BB)\n- Red: 2 (Cc Bb, Cc BB)\n- Checkered brown: 2 (Cc bb, cc Bb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:2:2, adding up to 6. But wait, that's only six phenotypic categories, but according to the options given, none seem to match this. Hmm.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, none of these options seem to match my previous calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Instead of focusing on genotypes, focus on the F2 individuals directly. Since the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (1/16)\n- Cc Bb (2/16)\n- cc BB (1/16)\n- Cc bb (2/16)\n\nNow, convert these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (1/16)\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 red (2/16)\n3. cc BB \u2192 plain red (1/16)\n4. Cc bb \u2192 checkered brown (2/16)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1:2, adding up to 6. But the options don't include 6. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 refers to the cross between the F1 and itself, which would indeed produce the standard dihybrid cross. But perhaps I need to account for the fact that the F1 is a hybrid, and the cross is between F1 and F1, resulting in F2. \n\nWait, the question says: \"the checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. They produce F1 (CcBb), and then F1 selfs to produce F2. That part I did correctly. So F2",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, the actual phenotypes might differ.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, the actual phenotypes might differ. But the question asks for phenotypic ratios, not genotype counts. So instead of counting genotypes, we count the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use a Punnett square where each parent contributes gametes based on their own alleles.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only give CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only give cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal numbers. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four possible gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb, each at 25% frequency. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 50% CB and 50% cb, then when multiplied, the F2 would have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Because each gamete is equally likely to combine with another. Now, the question mentions that the cross involves a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So the parents are CC BB and cc bb, making their F1 CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nNow, the next part is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. To determine this, I'll need to consider the genotypes of F2 and map them to phenotypes. The F2 would include genotypes like CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, etc., depending on how the alleles assort. But since the parents are homozygous for each gene, the segregation will follow Mendelian laws without any recombination. \n\nLet me list all possible genotypes for F2:\n\n- From F1 (CcBb): \n  - Parental contributions: CB and cb.\n  - Possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but cB is same as bc, so perhaps it's considered as CB and cb).\n  \nThus, F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- Cc BB (from CB + cb)\n- cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- Cc bb (from cb + CB)\n- cc bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014since both parents are homozygous, each parent can only contribute either CB or cb. Thus, F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (only if both parents contribute CB)\n2. Cc BB (if one parent contributes CB and the other cb)\n3. cc BB (if both contribute cb)\n4. Cc bb (if one parent contributes CB and the other cb)\n5. cc bb (if both contribute cb)\n\nHowever, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the specific genes. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe traits being studied are color and pigmentation. The parents are CC BB (dominant C and dominant B) and cc bb (recessive c and recessive b). Therefore, the F2 will express the following phenotypes:\n\n- Dominant C (C_), which results from the presence of at least one dominant allele (either C or c).\n- Dominant B (B_), due to having at least one dominant allele (B or b).\n\nSo, the phenotypes will depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, I'll create a Punnett square for F2, considering the possible gametes. Since each parent can only contribute CB or cb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes as above. Each gamete combination leads to a particular genotype.\n\nAlternatively, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 will exhibit a simple dihybrid cross. The possible genotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but for our case, since both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for F2:\n\n- Parents are CC BB and cc bb, but since they're both homozygous, their F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb, and F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1 = CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Now, when crossing CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, each parent can contribute either CB or cb gametes. So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (both CB)\n- 25% Cc BB (one CB, one cb)\n- 25% cc BB (two cb)\n- 25% Cc bb (one CB, one cb)\n- 25% cc bb (both cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's five categories. But since both genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the dominance hierarchy. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on both genes. The order is C (dominant) > c (recessive), and B (dominant) > b (recessive). So the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive in both genes.\n\nFor example, a bird that is Cc BB will have red color (since C is dominant) and brown fur (B is dominant). A bird that is cc bb will have plain color (since c is recessive) and checkered fur (b is recessive). Similarly, Cc Bb will have red and brown.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nEach parent contributes either CB or cb. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. Cc BB (25%)\n3. cc BB (25%)\n4. Cc bb (25%)\n5. cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n- Cc BB: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc BB: Both recessive \u2192 Plain red (c_ and b_)\n- Cc bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown (C_ and b_)\n- cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain brown (c_ and b_)\n\nNow, let's count the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (25%) and Cc BB (25%) \u2192 Total 50%\n- Plain red: cc BB (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: Cc bb (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: cc bb (25%) \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%. So the phenotypic ratio is 50% Checkered red : 25% Plain red : 25% Checkered brown : 25% Plain brown.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them match exactly. Let me review the options again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, etc.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 plain red, etc.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, etc.\n\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 plain red, etc.\n\nWait, my calculation shows that there are 50% Checkered red and 25% each of Plain red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown. So the ratio is 2:1:1:1, but in terms of percentage, it's 50% Checkered red, 25% each of the others.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 1, 3, 9, 3. That doesn't match. Option C says 9,3,3,1. That also doesn't match. Option G says 12, 2, 2, 0. Hmm, none seem to fit exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check. The hierarchy is C (dominant) > c (recessive); B (dominant) > b (recessive). So:\n\n- If both genes are dominant (C and B), it's Checkered red.\n- If C is dominant but B is recessive (C_ bb), it's Checkered brown.\n- If C is recessive but B is dominant (cc B_), it's Plain brown.\n- If both are recessive (cc bb), it's Plain red.\n\nIn the F2, the percentages are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- Cc bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo total:\n\nCheckered red: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 2:1 ratio compared to Plain red: 25%, and similarly for Checkered brown and Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 2:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this. Option H says 5:3:2:6, which isn't matching. Option E says 3:9:1:3, which is 3:9:1:3, adding to 16, which is different from 4 parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me try another approach. For each bird, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Let's categorize each F2 bird into the four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_ and B_): Checkered red (25%)\n2. Only C dominant (C_ and b_): Checkered brown (25%)\n3. Only b dominant (c_ and b_): Plain brown (25%)\n4. Both recessive (c_ and c_): Plain red (25%)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25% Checkered red, 25% Checkered brown, 25% Plain brown, 25% Plain red. Which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But this is not among the options. Looking back, none of the options match exactly. Perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: \"the adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F2 generation refers to the second generation after selfing F1. So, according to standard dihybrid ratios, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 distribution, but scaled based on the dominance hierarchy. In this case, the dominant combination (C_B_) would be Checkered red, while the recessive combination (cc_bb) would be Plain red. The other combinations (C_bb and cc_B_) would be Checkered brown and Plain brown respectively.\n\nCalculating the exact counts:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 (C_B_)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 (C_bb)\n- Plain brown: 3/16 (cc_B_)\n- Plain red: 1/16 (cc_bb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain red.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. However, option G says 12, 2, 2, 0, which sums to 16. That doesn't align. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's the case only if all phenotypes are equally represented, which isn't true here. Option D says 1,3,9,3, which matches 1:3:9:3, but that's a different distribution than what we've calculated. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the dominance hierarchy. Let me verify again:\n\n- C_ and B_: Checkered red (25%)\n- C_ and b_: Checkered brown (25%)\n- c_ and B_: Plain brown (25%)\n- c_ and c_: Plain red (25%)\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the closest option is G: 12, 2, 2, 0, which is 12:2:2:0. That suggests a different distribution, possibly because the parents are not fully heterozygous. Wait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which are indeed fully heterozygous for both genes. So the F2 should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me look at the options again. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which could correspond to 12:2:2:0, but that doesn't add up. Option J is 2,6,3,9, which is 2:6:3:9, adding to 20. Not relevant. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which is 6+2+6+2=16, but the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. Not matching. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which is 8+4+0+4=16, but the ratio is 8:4:0:4, which simplifies to 2:1:0:1. Not matching. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which adds to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is phrased as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that fits.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, the actual phenotypes might differ. But the question asks for phenotypic ratios, not genotype counts. So instead of counting genotypes, we count the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use a Punnett square where each parent contributes gametes based on their own alleles.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 can only give CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 can only give cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 is CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal numbers. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce four possible gametes: CB, CB, cb, cb, each at 25% frequency. Wait, no\u2014it's actually 50% CB and 50% cb, then when multiplied, the F2 would have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Because each gamete is equally likely to combine with another. Now, the question mentions that the cross involves a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So the parents are CC BB and cc bb, making their F1 CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nNow, the next part is about the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. To determine this, I'll need to consider the genotypes of F2 and map them to phenotypes. The F2 would include genotypes like CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, etc., depending on how the alleles assort. But since the parents are homozygous for each gene, the segregation will follow Mendelian laws without any recombination. \n\nLet me list all possible genotypes for F2:\n\n- From F1 (CcBb): \n  - Parental contributions: CB and cb.\n  - Possible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but cB is same as bc, so perhaps it's considered as CB and cb).\n  \nThus, F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- Cc BB (from CB + cb)\n- cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- Cc bb (from cb + CB)\n- cc bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014since both parents are homozygous, each parent can only contribute either CB or cb. Thus, F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (only if both parents contribute CB)\n2. Cc BB (if one parent contributes CB and the other cb)\n3. cc BB (if both contribute cb)\n4. Cc bb (if one parent contributes CB and the other cb)\n5. cc bb (if both contribute cb)\n\nHowever, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the specific genes. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe traits being studied are color and pigmentation. The parents are CC BB (dominant C and dominant B) and cc bb (recessive c and recessive b). Therefore, the F2 will express the following phenotypes:\n\n- Dominant C (C_), which results from the presence of at least one dominant allele (either C or c).\n- Dominant B (B_), due to having at least one dominant allele (B or b).\n\nSo, the phenotypes will depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, I'll create a Punnett square for F2, considering the possible gametes. Since each parent can only contribute CB or cb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes as above. Each gamete combination leads to a particular genotype.\n\nAlternatively, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 will exhibit a simple dihybrid cross. The possible genotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but for our case, since both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for F2:\n\n- Parents are CC BB and cc bb, but since they're both homozygous, their F1 is CcBb, and F2 is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb, and F2 is F1 \u00d7 F1 = CcBb \u00d7 CcBb. Now, when crossing CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, each parent can contribute either CB or cb gametes. So the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (both CB)\n- 25% Cc BB (one CB, one cb)\n- 25% cc BB (two cb)\n- 25% Cc bb (one CB, one cb)\n- 25% cc bb (both cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's five categories. But since both genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be determined by considering the dominance hierarchy. Let's see:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on both genes. The order is C (dominant) > c (recessive), and B (dominant) > b (recessive). So the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive in both genes.\n\nFor example, a bird that is Cc BB will have red color (since C is dominant) and brown fur (B is dominant). A bird that is cc bb will have plain color (since c is recessive) and checkered fur (b is recessive). Similarly, Cc Bb will have red and brown.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nEach parent contributes either CB or cb. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. Cc BB (25%)\n3. cc BB (25%)\n4. Cc bb (25%)\n5. cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered red (C_ and B_)\n- Cc BB: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc BB: Both recessive \u2192 Plain red (c_ and b_)\n- Cc bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown (C_ and b_)\n- cc bb: Both recessive \u2192 Plain brown (c_ and b_)\n\nNow, let's count the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC BB (25%) and Cc BB (25%) \u2192 Total 50%\n- Plain red: cc BB (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown: Cc bb (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown: cc bb (25%) \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%. So the phenotypic ratio is 50% Checkered red : 25% Plain red : 25% Checkered brown : 25% Plain brown.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them match exactly. Let me review the options again.\n\nOptions given:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, etc.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 plain red, etc.\n\nC. 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, etc.\n\nD. 1 checkered red, 3 plain red, etc.\n\nWait, my calculation shows that there are 50% Checkered red and 25% each of Plain red, Checkered brown, and Plain brown. So the ratio is 2:1:1:1, but in terms of percentage, it's 50% Checkered red, 25% each of the others.\n\nLooking at the options, option D says 1, 3, 9, 3. That doesn't match. Option C says 9,3,3,1. That also doesn't match. Option G says 12, 2, 2, 0. Hmm, none seem to fit exactly. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check. The hierarchy is C (dominant) > c (recessive); B (dominant) > b (recessive). So:\n\n- If both genes are dominant (C and B), it's Checkered red.\n- If C is dominant but B is recessive (C_ bb), it's Checkered brown.\n- If C is recessive but B is dominant (cc B_), it's Plain brown.\n- If both are recessive (cc bb), it's Plain red.\n\nIn the F2, the percentages are:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc BB: 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 Plain red\n- Cc bb: 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo total:\n\nCheckered red: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 2:1 ratio compared to Plain red: 25%, and similarly for Checkered brown and Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 2:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect this. Option H says 5:3:2:6, which isn't matching. Option E says 3:9:1:3, which is 3:9:1:3, adding to 16, which is different from 4 parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me try another approach. For each bird, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Let's categorize each F2 bird into the four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both dominant (C_ and B_): Checkered red (25%)\n2. Only C dominant (C_ and b_): Checkered brown (25%)\n3. Only b dominant (c_ and b_): Plain brown (25%)\n4. Both recessive (c_ and c_): Plain red (25%)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25% Checkered red, 25% Checkered brown, 25% Plain brown, 25% Plain red. Which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But this is not among the options. Looking back, none of the options match exactly. Perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: \"the adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F2 generation refers to the second generation after selfing F1. So, according to standard dihybrid ratios, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 distribution, but scaled based on the dominance hierarchy. In this case, the dominant combination (C_B_) would be Checkered red, while the recessive combination (cc_bb) would be Plain red. The other combinations (C_bb and cc_B_) would be Checkered brown and Plain brown respectively.\n\nCalculating the exact counts:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 (C_B_)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 (C_bb)\n- Plain brown: 3/16 (cc_B_)\n- Plain red: 1/16 (cc_bb)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain red.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. However, option G says 12, 2, 2, 0, which sums to 16. That doesn't align. Option F says 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's the case only if all phenotypes are equally represented, which isn't true here. Option D says 1,3,9,3, which matches 1:3:9:3, but that's a different distribution than what we've calculated. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the dominance hierarchy. Let me verify again:\n\n- C_ and B_: Checkered red (25%)\n- C_ and b_: Checkered brown (25%)\n- c_ and B_: Plain brown (25%)\n- c_ and c_: Plain red (25%)\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the closest option is G: 12, 2, 2, 0, which is 12:2:2:0. That suggests a different distribution, possibly because the parents are not fully heterozygous. Wait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which are indeed fully heterozygous for both genes. So the F2 should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me look at the options again. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which could correspond to 12:2:2:0, but that doesn't add up. Option J is 2,6,3,9, which is 2:6:3:9, adding to 20. Not relevant. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which is 6+2+6+2=16, but the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. Not matching. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which is 8+4+0+4=16, but the ratio is 8:4:0:4, which simplifies to 2:1:0:1. Not matching. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which adds to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is phrased as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that fits. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Similarly, for the B gene, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: BB, Bb, and bb.\n\nHowever, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of focusing on F1 and F2, perhaps I should consider the actual dihybrid cross. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would come from the selfing of F1.\n\nWait, no\u2014the user already provided the gametes for F1, which were CB, cb, cB, and cb. That seems off because Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes in equal numbers (50% each). Then, the F2 would be the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, which would involve all combinations of CB and cb gametes.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be CC BB (25%), Cc Bb (50%), and cc bb (25%). Wait, no\u2014that's if all gametes are equally likely. Alternatively, considering each gene independently assorts, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined F2 genotypes would be the product of these distributions. Thus, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25% x 25% = 6.25% overall)\n- CC Bb (25% x 50% = 12.5% overall)\n- CC bb (25% x 25% = 6.25%)\n- Cc BB (50% x 25% = 12.5%)\n- Cc Bb (50% x 50% = 25%)\n- Cc bb (50% x 25% = 12.5%)\n- cc BB (25% x 25% = 6.25%)\n- cc Bb (25% x 50% = 12.5%)\n- cc bb (25% x 25% = 6.25%)\n\nNow, each of these genotypes corresponds to specific phenotypes based on the dominance of alleles.

Let me instead think in terms of the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the genetic ratios.\n\nGiven the dihybrid cross, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated using the Punnett square.\n\nBut perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try a different approach.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are homozygous (one for each trait), the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But wait, that applies when both parents are heterozygotes. In our case, the parents are homozygous for each trait, so the cross would lead to a different ratio.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, but the parents are both homozygous for each gene. So the F2 would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for dominance. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the standard dihybrid cross, when both parents are heterozygotes (e.g., AaBb), the F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, with each phenotype represented accordingly. However, when both parents are homozygous (like AA aa), the F2 ratio changes because the alleles don't assort independently. Instead, all offspring will inherit the same alleles from both parents, leading to a different phenotypic outcome.\n\nIn our case, Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). Their F1 would be Cc BB (wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 should be Cc Bb, right? Because each parent contributes one allele. From Parent 1 (CC BB), it can only give CB. From Parent 2 (cc bb), it can only give cb. So F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2. Each F1 individual can produce gametes CB and cb. So F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (because C is dominant, B is dominant)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (B is dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (because c is recessive, and b is recessive)\n\nWait, hold on. The question specifies that red is dominant over brown, and brown is dominant over plain. So:\n\n- If an animal has at least one dominant allele for red, it's Checkered Red.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for brown, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for plain, it's Plain Red.\n- Otherwise, it's Plain Brown.\n\nBut in reality, the hierarchy is: red > brown > plain. So, the presence of any dominant red allele makes it Checkered Red, regardless of brown. Presence of any dominant brown allele makes it Checkered Brown, regardless of red. And presence of any dominant plain allele makes it Plain Red, otherwise, it's Plain Brown.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC bb: C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc BB: C is dominant, B is dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc bb: C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: Both c and B are recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Both c and b are recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: c is recessive, b is recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (3), Cc Bb (4) \u2192 Total 4\n- Checkered Brown: CC bb (1), Cc bb (2) \u2192 Total 2\n- Plain Brown: cc BB (1), cc Bb (2) \u2192 Total 2\n- Plain Red: cc bb (1) \u2192 Total 1\n\nThis adds up to 4+2+2+1=9, which matches the total.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red 4, Checkered Brown 2, Plain Brown 2, Plain Red 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G is \"Checkered Red 12, Checkered Brown 2, Plain Red 2, Plain Brown 0\" \u2014 that's not matching. Option F is \"Checkered Red 4, Checkered Brown 4, Plain Red 4, Plain Brown 4\" \u2014 also not matching. Option J is \"Checkered Red 2, Checkered Brown 6, Plain Red 3, Plain Brown 1\". None of the options seem to match my calculations. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotype hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the hierarchy is that red is dominant over brown, which is dominant over plain. So, if an animal has at least one dominant red allele, it's Checkered Red. If it has at least one dominant brown allele, it's Checkered Brown. Only if it has neither dominant red nor dominant brown does it become Plain Red. Otherwise, it's Plain Brown.\n\nIn that case, the genotypes and their phenotypes would still be the same as before. So perhaps the options are wrong, but according to my calculations, the correct ratio is 4 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Brown, 2 Plain Brown, and 1 Plain Red. But none of the options reflect this exactly.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nNone of these match my 4:2:2:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, each parent is Cc Bb. So when crossed, the F2 genotypes should include all possible combinations. Wait, but in reality, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 50% Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nBecause:\n\n- CC BB comes from CB \u00d7 CB\n- Cc Bb comes from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB\n- cc bb comes from cb \u00d7 cb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the F1 is Cc Bb, so the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% CC Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% CC bb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% Cc BB (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc BB (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Let me use the correct Punnett square approach for the F2 generation of Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nEach parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc. Wait, no\u2014if each parent is Cc Bb, they can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, bc. So the F2 would have these gametes in equal proportions.\n\nThe Punnett square would thus have the following genotypes:\n\n- (CB \u00d7 CB): CC BB (25%)\n- (CB \u00d7 cb): Cc Bb (25%)\n- (CB \u00d7 cB): Cc BB (25%)\n- (CB \u00d7 bc): Cc Bb (25%)\n- (cb \u00d7 CB): Cc Bb (25%)\n- (cb \u00d7 cb): cc bb (25%)\n- (cb \u00d7 cB): cc Bb (25%)\n- (cb \u00d7 bc): cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, but some of these may combine into the same phenotype. Let me group them:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the actual genes separately, the F2 genotypes would depend on the independent assortment of the two genes. Let me clarify:\n\nEach parent contributes either CB or cb gametes. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four possible genotypes based on the combination of the gametes. The F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cC (from cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, since CB and cb are the same alleles, the distinct genotypes would be CC, Cc, and cc. Similarly, for the B gene, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: BB, Bb, and bb.\n\nHowever, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of focusing on F1 and F2, perhaps I should consider the actual dihybrid cross. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would come from the selfing of F1.\n\nWait, no\u2014the user already provided the gametes for F1, which were CB, cb, cB, and cb. That seems off because Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes in equal numbers (50% each). Then, the F2 would be the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, which would involve all combinations of CB and cb gametes.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB = CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB = Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb = cc bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be CC BB (25%), Cc Bb (50%), and cc bb (25%). Wait, no\u2014that's if all gametes are equally likely. Alternatively, considering each gene independently assorts, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\nFor gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined F2 genotypes would be the product of these distributions. Thus, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25% x 25% = 6.25% overall)\n- CC Bb (25% x 50% = 12.5% overall)\n- CC bb (25% x 25% = 6.25%)\n- Cc BB (50% x 25% = 12.5%)\n- Cc Bb (50% x 50% = 25%)\n- Cc bb (50% x 25% = 12.5%)\n- cc BB (25% x 25% = 6.25%)\n- cc Bb (25% x 50% = 12.5%)\n- cc bb (25% x 25% = 6.25%)\n\nNow, each of these genotypes corresponds to specific phenotypes based on the dominance of alleles. Let's map them:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is dominant, and B is dominant)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (B is dominant)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown (b is recessive)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (B is dominant)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (B is dominant)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown (b is recessive)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (c is recessive)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (b is recessive)\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered Red (c is recessive)\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, Cc BB, Cc BB \u2192 Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake here. Each genotype maps directly to a phenotype without further analysis. So:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown\n- CC bb: Plain Brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb: Plain Brown\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered Red\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB, Cc BB, Cc bb \u2192 Wait, no: CC BB is one, Cc BB is another, and Cc bb is another. So three Checkered Reds.\n- Checkered Brown: CC Bb, Cc Bb \u2192 Two Checkered Brongs.\n- Plain Brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 Two Plain Brongs.\n- Plain Red: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 Two Plain Red.\n\nWait, that adds up to 3+2+2+2=9, which doesn't make sense because there are nine possible genotypes, each leading to one phenotype. Wait, let me recount properly:\n\nLooking at each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n5.

Wait, no, let me list them clearly:\n\nCheckered Brown: 2. CC Bb and 6. Cc Bb \u2192 2\n\nPlain Brown: 3. CC bb and 6. Cc bb \u2192 2\n\nPlain Red: 7. cc BB and 8. cc Bb \u2192 2\n\nWait, that totals 3+2+2+2=9, which makes sense.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:2:2:2.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount each phenotype:\n\n1.

Let me instead think in terms of the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the genetic ratios.\n\nGiven the dihybrid cross, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated using the Punnett square.\n\nBut perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

However, when both parents are homozygous (like AA aa), the F2 ratio changes because the alleles don't assort independently. Instead, all offspring will inherit the same alleles from both parents, leading to a different phenotypic outcome.\n\nIn our case, Parent 1 is CC BB (homozygous dominant for both traits), and Parent 2 is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both traits). Their F1 would be Cc BB (wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 should be Cc Bb, right? Because each parent contributes one allele. From Parent 1 (CC BB), it can only give CB. From Parent 2 (cc bb), it can only give cb. So F1 is Cc Bb.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2. Each F1 individual can produce gametes CB and cb. So F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (because C is dominant, B is dominant)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (B is dominant)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (because c is recessive, and b is recessive)\n\nWait, hold on. The question specifies that red is dominant over brown, and brown is dominant over plain. So:\n\n- If an animal has at least one dominant allele for red, it's Checkered Red.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for brown, it's Checkered Brown.\n- If it has at least one dominant allele for plain, it's Plain Red.\n- Otherwise, it's Plain Brown.\n\nBut in reality, the hierarchy is: red > brown > plain. So, the presence of any dominant red allele makes it Checkered Red, regardless of brown. Presence of any dominant brown allele makes it Checkered Brown, regardless of red. And presence of any dominant plain allele makes it Plain Red, otherwise, it's Plain Brown.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC Bb: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- CC bb: C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- Cc BB: C is dominant, B is dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb: C and B are dominant \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc bb: C is dominant, b is recessive \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc BB: Both c and B are recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Both c and b are recessive \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: c is recessive, b is recessive \u2192 Plain Red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red: CC BB (1), CC Bb (2), Cc BB (3), Cc Bb (4) \u2192 Total 4\n- Checkered Brown: CC bb (1), Cc bb (2) \u2192 Total 2\n- Plain Brown: cc BB (1), cc Bb (2) \u2192 Total 2\n- Plain Red: cc bb (1) \u2192 Total 1\n\nThis adds up to 4+2+2+1=9, which matches the total.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is Checkered Red 4, Checkered Brown 2, Plain Brown 2, Plain Red 1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G is \"Checkered Red 12, Checkered Brown 2, Plain Red 2, Plain Brown 0\" \u2014 that's not matching. Option F is \"Checkered Red 4, Checkered Brown 4, Plain Red 4, Plain Brown 4\" \u2014 also not matching. Option J is \"Checkered Red 2, Checkered Brown 6, Plain Red 3, Plain Brown 1\". None of the options seem to match my calculations. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotype hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the hierarchy is that red is dominant over brown, which is dominant over plain. So, if an animal has at least one dominant red allele, it's Checkered Red. If it has at least one dominant brown allele, it's Checkered Brown. Only if it has neither dominant red nor dominant brown does it become Plain Red. Otherwise, it's Plain Brown.\n\nIn that case, the genotypes and their phenotypes would still be the same as before. So perhaps the options are wrong, but according to my calculations, the correct ratio is 4 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Brown, 2 Plain Brown, and 1 Plain Red. But none of the options reflect this exactly.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nA. 6,2,2,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nNone of these match my 4:2:2:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, each parent is Cc Bb. So when crossed, the F2 genotypes should include all possible combinations. Wait, but in reality, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 50% Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 25% cc bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nBecause:\n\n- CC BB comes from CB \u00d7 CB\n- Cc Bb comes from CB \u00d7 cb and cb \u00d7 CB\n- cc bb comes from cb \u00d7 cb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the F1 is Cc Bb, so the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% CC Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% CC bb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% Cc BB (from cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc BB (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Let me use the correct Punnett square approach for the F2 generation of Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb.\n\nEach parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, bc. Wait, no\u2014if each parent is Cc Bb, they can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, bc. So the F2 would have these gametes in equal proportions.\n\nThe Punnett square would thus have the following genotypes:\n\n- (CB \u00d7 CB): CC BB (25%)\n- (CB \u00d7 cb): Cc Bb (25%)\n- (CB \u00d7 cB): Cc BB (25%)\n- (CB \u00d7 bc): Cc Bb (25%)\n- (cb \u00d7 CB): Cc Bb (25%)\n- (cb \u00d7 cb): cc bb (25%)\n- (cb \u00d7 cB): cc Bb (25%)\n- (cb \u00d7 bc): cc Bb (25%)\n\nWait, but some of these may combine into the same phenotype. Let me group them:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, in reality, the segregation might follow Mendelian ratios if the genes assort independently. So yes, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes. Now, what are the phenotypes? Phenotype depends on both genes.\n\nLet me map the genes:\n\n- Gene C: C (red) vs c (plain)\n- Gene B: B (brown) vs b (checkered)\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of C/B and c/b. So possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_)\n2. Checkered Brown (c_B_)\n3. Plain Red (C_bb)\n4. Plain Brown (c_bB)\n\nWait, actually, the letters are assigned such that the dominant alleles come first. So for each gene, the dominant is written first, then the recessive.\n\nSo for example, a bird with genotype CcBb would express both C and B traits. But let's clarify the actual phenotype codes. Typically, dominance follows the order, so if C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, the order is C > c and B > b.\n\nBut sometimes, the order is reversed, but here it's given as C is dominant for pigment, c for plain. And B for brown, b for checkered. So for each gene, the dominant allele comes first.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- If the bird has at least one C allele, it expresses pigment (Red).\n- If it has c, it's plain.\n\nFor Gene B:\n- If the bird has at least one B allele, it expresses brown.\n- If it has b, it's checkered.\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of both genes. So possible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered Red (since C is dominant, and B is dominant; but wait, no\u2014if C is dominant, any presence of C makes it red, regardless of whether B is present. Similarly for B. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me re-express:\n\nIf a bird has C (dominant), it's red, regardless of B. If it doesn't have C (has c), it's plain, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has B (dominant), it's brown, regardless of C. Only when both C and B are missing does it become checkered (c and b).\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (C_B_): C present, B present \u2192 c and b are recessive for both, so both are checkered and red.\n\n2. Checkered Brown (cB_): c present (plain), B present (brown) \u2192 c and b.\n\n3. Plain Red (c_bb): c present (plain), b absent (so red), and B absent (no B \u2192 plain). So checkered but plain color.\n\n4. Plain Brown (cbB_): c present (plain), B present (brown) \u2192 c and b.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me make a table:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype (C and B)\n--- | ---\nCheckered Red (CR) | C present, B present \u2192 C_B_\nCheckered Brown (CB) | c present, B present \u2192 cB_\nPlain Red (PR) | c present, B absent \u2192 c__\nPlain Brown (PB) | c absent, B present \u2192 __B_\n\nYes, that's correct.

Alternatively, considering the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be 9 (CC) :3 (Cc) :3 (cc) :1 (bb) for the four possible phenotypes. Yes, that matches.\n\nNow, translating these to actual counts:\n\n- CR: 9 (all CC and Cc where C and B are present)\n- CB: 3 (Cc and CcB_? Wait, no. Wait, the F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Among these, CC is CR, Cc is CB, cc is PR, and bb is PB.\n\nSo for the F2 phenotypes:\n\n- CR occurs when the genotype is CC or Cc (both have C and B present). How many of these?\n\nIn the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the number of CR is 9 (for CC) plus 3 (for Cc). Wait, no, wait: Actually, the 9:3:3:1 refers to the distribution among the four phenotypes. Each phenotype corresponds directly to the count:\n\n- CR: 9 (number of individuals with genotype C_C_)\n- CB: 3 (number of individuals with genotype CcB_)\n- PR: 3 (number of individuals with genotype c__)\n- PB:1 (number of individuals with genotype ___B)\n\nThus, for the F2 population:\n\n- CR: 9\n- CB:3\n- PR:3\n- PB:1\n\nSo total F2 population is 16.

That doesn't match.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

    "rollout": " However, considering dominance and blending, but since these are separate genes, we don't consider blending. Instead, we treat them independently. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n  - 1/4 CC (homozygous dominant)\n  - 1/4 Cc (heterozygous dominant for C)\n  - 1/4 cc (homozygous recessive for C)\n  - 1/4 bb (homozygous recessive for B)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 would be a 9:3:3:1 ratio if considering both genes separately. However, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, not the genotype ratio. So we'll need to look at the phenotypes.\n\nPhenotype determination is based on both genes. Let's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red (since C is dominant for pigment, B for color)\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown (C dominant for pigment, B dominant for color)\n3. CC bb: Plain brown (C dominant for pigment, b recessive for color)\n4. Cc BB: Pigment is determined by C, so Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment Checkered brown\n6.

Alternatively, perhaps each combination leads to specific traits. Let me clarify the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor pigment (Gene C):\n- C > c \u2192 C produces dominant pigment, c recessive.\n\nFor color (Gene B):\n- B > b \u2192 B produces dominant color, b recessive.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by the presence of both dominant alleles. If either C or B is recessive, the phenotype depends on the other. Let's go through each possible genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 type (CC BB) \u2192 1 individual\n- Checkered brown: 2 types (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb) \u2192 3 individuals\n- Plain brown: 3 types (CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb) \u2192 3 individuals\n- Plain red: 4 types (cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb?) Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in my count above, I listed 9 genotypes, but the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 3 (CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb)\n- Plain red: 4? Wait, no:\n\nLooking at the nine genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 individual\n- Checkered brown: 3 individuals\n- Plain brown: 3 individuals\n- Plain red: 4 individuals (wait, no\u2014looking at the last three: 7,8,9 are plain red. That's three individuals.)\n\nWait, no, that's inconsistent. Let me recount:\n\nGenotype 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red\nGenotype 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\nGenotype 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo that's two individuals with Plain red and one with Plain brown. Hmm, now I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\n1 | Checkered red\n2 | Checkered brown\n3 | Plain brown\n4 | Checkered brown\n5 | Checkered brown\n6 | Plain brown\n7 | Plain red\n8 | Plain brown\n9 | Plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2 (genotypes 7 and 9)\n\nThat makes sense now. So the phenotypic distribution is 1:3:3:2, but scaled appropriately based on the number of individuals. Assuming equal numbers in each genotype, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:2. However, the options given are A to H, each with different ratios. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not matching our counts.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match our calculation where checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 3. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me re-examine:\n\nGenotype 1: Checkered red\n2: Checkered brown\n3: Plain brown\n4: Checkered brown\n5: Checkered brown\n6: Plain brown\n7: Plain red\n8: Plain brown\n9: Plain red\n\nYes, that's correct. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n\nWhich totals 9. So the ratio is 1:3:3:2. None of the answer choices directly reflect this. Perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question says: \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adi hybrid crosses usually refer to cross between heterozygotes, like Aa x Bb. But here, the parents are homozygous. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Are the parents both homozygous? Yes, CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, but the question then says \"show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps I've miscalculated the F2 phenotypes. Let me try another approach. Let's assume that the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the next generation. To determine the F2 phenotypes, let's calculate the probabilities.\n\nEach parent contributes gametes with certain probabilities. From CC BB (homozygous dominant):\n\n- Can only contribute CB gametes (100%).\n\nFrom cc bb (homozygous recessive):\n\n- Can only contribute cb gametes (100%).\n\nTherefore, F1 would be CcBb (all gametes are CB). Then, F2 would be F1 x F1 = CcBb x CcBb.\n\nWhen multiplying two CcBb gametes, each allele pair segregates independently. So:\n\nFor C (pigment): Each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing C or c.\nFor B (color): Each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing B or b.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for both genes. Wait, no\u2014each gene segregates independently, so the combined phenotypes would depend on both genes. Let's see:\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (C and c):\n\n- CC: Checkered for C (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered for C\n- cc: Plain for C\n\nSimilarly, for color (B and b):\n\n- BB: Brown for B\n- Bb: Brown for B\n- bb: Plain for B\n\nSince both genes are independent, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both. Let's map the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Plain brown\n4. Cc BB: Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb: Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: Plain brown\n7. cc BB: Plain red\n8. cc Bb: Plain brown\n9. cc bb: Plain red\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 3 (CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb)\n- Plain red: 2 (cc BB, cc bb)\n\nWait, earlier I thought there were three Plain brown and two Plain red, but according to the list, it's two individuals with Plain red (genotypes 7 and 9) and three with Plain brown (genotypes 3, 6, 8). So:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n\nThis adds up to 9, which matches the total number of F2 individuals (3 x 3 = 9).\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:2. But looking at the answer options, none exactly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match our calculated 1:3:3:2. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the genotypes and phenotypes. Another approach: instead of listing all, think about how many of each phenotype exist in the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBut wait, since the parents are homozygous, the F1 is always CcBb, and F2 would be a dihybrid cross among these.\n\nHowever, since C and B are independent, the phenotypic ratio would still follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern, but considering both genes. Wait, but since the phenotype is determined by both genes, the ratio would be:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_): 25%\nCheckered brown (C_Bb): 25%\nPlain brown (CC_b_, Cc_b, cc_b): 25%?\nWait, no, because:\n\nWait, each gene's segregation is independent. So the phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 25% (both C and B dominant)\n- Checkered brown (C_Bb): 25% (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain brown (CC_b_): 25% (C recessive, B dominant)\n- Plain red (cc_b_): 25% (both c and b recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain red\n\nFor the color gene (B):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability C dominant AND B dominant) = (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Checkered brown: (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown: (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain red: (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, that's not right. Because:\n\n- For C: dominant is 1/2 (C_), recessive is 1/2 (cc).\n- For B: dominant is 1/2 (BB_), recessive is 1/2 (Bb).\n\nBut the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both. So:\n\n- Checkered red occurs when C_ (pigment dominant) AND B_ (color dominant) \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Checkered brown occurs when C_ AND bb \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown occurs when cc AND B_ \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain red occurs when cc AND bb \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nThus, each phenotype has a 25% chance, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. But that contradicts our earlier enumeration where the actual counts gave a 1:3:3:2 ratio. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh! Because the F2 generation isn't a dihybrid cross but rather a test cross from one parent to the other. In this case, the F2 comes from a dihybrid cross, but when considering phenotypic expression, the probability remains 25% for each phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation, not the genetic ratio. So if each phenotype appears equally often, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But that doesn't align with any of the answer options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It might be a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, treating each trait independently. But that wouldn't apply here.\n\nWait, going back to the original question, it mentions checking whether the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adi hybrid crosses usually involve two parents producing a dihybrid cross. So, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be a dihybrid cross among those.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but upon closer inspection, considering both genes together, each phenotype would have an equal chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't include such a ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and consider all combinations regardless of dominance. In that case, the phenotypes would simply be determined by the presence of any recessive allele, regardless of dominance. So, the ratio would be 1:3:3:1, but scaling it to 9:3:3:1. But that also doesn't match the answer options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler than I'm thinking. Maybe it's a dihybrid cross with simple Mendelian ratios, ignoring dominance, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't present this either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the dihybrid cross to have phenotypic ratios based solely on the presence of the recessive alleles, resulting in a 1:3:3:1 ratio. But the options provided don't match this.\n\nLooking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This sums to 16, which is too high unless it's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the dominance hierarchy, leading to a 1:3:3:2 ratio, which corresponds to option E.\n\nWait, earlier analysis showed a 1:3:3:2 ratio, which would mean checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain brown is 3 parts, and plain red is 2 parts. However, none of the answer options reflect this exactly. Option E suggests 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and ",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

However, considering dominance and blending, but since these are separate genes, we don't consider blending. Instead, we treat them independently. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n  - 1/4 CC (homozygous dominant)\n  - 1/4 Cc (heterozygous dominant for C)\n  - 1/4 cc (homozygous recessive for C)\n  - 1/4 bb (homozygous recessive for B)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 would be a 9:3:3:1 ratio if considering both genes separately.

Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 individual\n- Checkered brown: 3 individuals\n- Plain brown: 3 individuals\n- Plain red: 4 individuals (wait, no\u2014looking at the last three: 7,8,9 are plain red. That's three individuals.)\n\nWait, no, that's inconsistent. Let me recount:\n\nGenotype 7: cc BB \u2192 Plain red\nGenotype 8: cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\nGenotype 9: cc bb \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo that's two individuals with Plain red and one with Plain brown. Hmm, now I'm getting confused. Let me make a table:\n\nGenotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\n1 | Checkered red\n2 | Checkered brown\n3 | Plain brown\n4 | Checkered brown\n5 | Checkered brown\n6 | Plain brown\n7 | Plain red\n8 | Plain brown\n9 | Plain red\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2 (genotypes 7 and 9)\n\nThat makes sense now. So the phenotypic distribution is 1:3:3:2, but scaled appropriately based on the number of individuals. Assuming equal numbers in each genotype, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:2. However, the options given are A to H, each with different ratios. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not matching our counts.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to match our calculation where checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 3. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me re-examine:\n\nGenotype 1: Checkered red\n2: Checkered brown\n3: Plain brown\n4: Checkered brown\n5: Checkered brown\n6: Plain brown\n7: Plain red\n8: Plain brown\n9: Plain red\n\nYes, that's correct. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n\nWhich totals 9. So the ratio is 1:3:3:2. None of the answer choices directly reflect this. Perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question says: \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adi hybrid crosses usually refer to cross between heterozygotes, like Aa x Bb. But here, the parents are homozygous. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Are the parents both homozygous? Yes, CC BB and cc bb.\n\nWait, but the question then says \"show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps I've miscalculated the F2 phenotypes. Let me try another approach. Let's assume that the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the next generation. To determine the F2 phenotypes, let's calculate the probabilities.\n\nEach parent contributes gametes with certain probabilities. From CC BB (homozygous dominant):\n\n- Can only contribute CB gametes (100%).\n\nFrom cc bb (homozygous recessive):\n\n- Can only contribute cb gametes (100%).\n\nTherefore, F1 would be CcBb (all gametes are CB). Then, F2 would be F1 x F1 = CcBb x CcBb.\n\nWhen multiplying two CcBb gametes, each allele pair segregates independently. So:\n\nFor C (pigment): Each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing C or c.\nFor B (color): Each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing B or b.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for both genes. Wait, no\u2014each gene segregates independently, so the combined phenotypes would depend on both genes. Let's see:\n\nPossible genotypes for pigment (C and c):\n\n- CC: Checkered for C (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered for C\n- cc: Plain for C\n\nSimilarly, for color (B and b):\n\n- BB: Brown for B\n- Bb: Brown for B\n- bb: Plain for B\n\nSince both genes are independent, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both. Let's map the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n3. CC bb: Plain brown\n4. Cc BB: Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb: Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb: Plain brown\n7. cc BB: Plain red\n8. cc Bb: Plain brown\n9. cc bb: Plain red\n\nNow, counting:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Plain brown: 3 (CC bb, Cc bb, cc bb)\n- Plain red: 2 (cc BB, cc bb)\n\nWait, earlier I thought there were three Plain brown and two Plain red, but according to the list, it's two individuals with Plain red (genotypes 7 and 9) and three with Plain brown (genotypes 3, 6, 8). So:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n\nThis adds up to 9, which matches the total number of F2 individuals (3 x 3 = 9).\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:2. But looking at the answer options, none exactly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options match our calculated 1:3:3:2. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the genotypes and phenotypes. Another approach: instead of listing all, think about how many of each phenotype exist in the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nBut wait, since the parents are homozygous, the F1 is always CcBb, and F2 would be a dihybrid cross among these.\n\nHowever, since C and B are independent, the phenotypic ratio would still follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern, but considering both genes. Wait, but since the phenotype is determined by both genes, the ratio would be:\n\nCheckered red (C_B_): 25%\nCheckered brown (C_Bb): 25%\nPlain brown (CC_b_, Cc_b, cc_b): 25%?\nWait, no, because:\n\nWait, each gene's segregation is independent. So the phenotypic breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red (C_B_): 25% (both C and B dominant)\n- Checkered brown (C_Bb): 25% (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain brown (CC_b_): 25% (C recessive, B dominant)\n- Plain red (cc_b_): 25% (both c and b recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain red\n\nFor the color gene (B):\n\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Plain\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by both genes:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability C dominant AND B dominant) = (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Checkered brown: (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown: (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain red: (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, that's not right. Because:\n\n- For C: dominant is 1/2 (C_), recessive is 1/2 (cc).\n- For B: dominant is 1/2 (BB_), recessive is 1/2 (Bb).\n\nBut the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both. So:\n\n- Checkered red occurs when C_ (pigment dominant) AND B_ (color dominant) \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Checkered brown occurs when C_ AND bb \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain brown occurs when cc AND B_ \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n- Plain red occurs when cc AND bb \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nThus, each phenotype has a 25% chance, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. But that contradicts our earlier enumeration where the actual counts gave a 1:3:3:2 ratio. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh! Because the F2 generation isn't a dihybrid cross but rather a test cross from one parent to the other. In this case, the F2 comes from a dihybrid cross, but when considering phenotypic expression, the probability remains 25% for each phenotype, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation, not the genetic ratio. So if each phenotype appears equally often, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But that doesn't align with any of the answer options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. It might be a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, treating each trait independently. But that wouldn't apply here.\n\nWait, going back to the original question, it mentions checking whether the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Adi hybrid crosses usually involve two parents producing a dihybrid cross. So, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be a dihybrid cross among those.\n\nEarlier, I thought that the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but upon closer inspection, considering both genes together, each phenotype would have an equal chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't include such a ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and consider all combinations regardless of dominance. In that case, the phenotypes would simply be determined by the presence of any recessive allele, regardless of dominance. So, the ratio would be 1:3:3:1, but scaling it to 9:3:3:1. But that also doesn't match the answer options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simpler than I'm thinking. Maybe it's a dihybrid cross with simple Mendelian ratios, ignoring dominance, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But the options don't present this either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the dihybrid cross to have phenotypic ratios based solely on the presence of the recessive alleles, resulting in a 1:3:3:1 ratio. But the options provided don't match this.\n\nLooking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This sums to 16, which is too high unless it's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the dominance hierarchy, leading to a 1:3:3:2 ratio, which corresponds to option E.\n\nWait, earlier analysis showed a 1:3:3:2 ratio, which would mean checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain brown is 3 parts, and plain red is 2 parts. However, none of the answer options reflect this exactly. Option E suggests 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and ",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, since C and B are independent, the actual F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, since C and B are independent, the actual F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But according to the given options, the answer choices don't include such ratios, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous, but rather the initial cross is different. Wait, looking back at the question, the parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So when these two parents mate, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes either CB or cb. Then, when F1 selfs (to get F2), the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes depend on both alleles. For pigment color (gene C):\n\n- C_ = red\n- cc = plain\n\nFor color (gene B):\n\n- B_ = brown\n- bb = checkered\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both traits. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nEach F2 individual will have two alleles for C and two for B. The combination of these alleles determines the phenotype.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 (which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb).\n\nThe possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. However, due to independence of genes, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But let me confirm:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (CC BB): 25% (phenotype: Checkered Red)\n- Heterozygous dominant (Cc BB): 25% (Checkered Brown)\n- Homozygous recessive (cc bb): 25% (Plain Red)\n- Heterozygous recessive (cc BB): 25% (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate because the F2 genotypes correspond to the F1 gametes, which are all CcBb. So the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- For C (C_):\n  - C_: red\n  - cc: plain\n- For B (B_):\n  - B_: brown\n  - bb: checkered\n\nSo each F2 individual's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n\n2. Cc BB:\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n3. CC bb:\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n\n4.

Let me count:\n\nFrom the above, each F2 individual can be categorized into four phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): individuals where C_ and B_ are present.\n- Checkered Brown (CB): C_ and B_ present, but B_ is brown.\n- Plain Red (PR): C_ absent (cc) but B_ present (B_)\n- Plain Brown (PB): C_ absent but B_ absent (bb)\n\nSo now, how many individuals fall into each category?\n\nLooking at the Punnett square:\n\n- CR occurs when C is present (either Cc or CC) and B is present (either BB or Bb).\n- CB occurs when C is present but B is absent (BB).\n- PR occurs when C is absent (cc) but B is present (Bb).\n- PB occurs when both C and B are absent (bb).\n\nLet's calculate each:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since each F1 (CcBb) produces 4 gametes, and 4\u00d74=16).\n\nBreakdown:\n\n- CC BB: 1 \u2192 CR\n- Cc BB: 2 \u2192 CR (because C_ is present)\n- CC bb: 1 \u2192 PR\n- Cc bb: 2 \u2192 PB (since C is cc and B is bb)\n- cc BB: 1 \u2192 CR\n- cc BB: 1 \u2192 CR\n- cc bb: 1 \u2192 PR\n- cc bb: 1 \u2192 PB\n\nWait, no, each F2 individual comes from the F1 gametes. Let me recount correctly:\n\nEach F1 gamete is either CB, cb, cB, or cb. So:\n\n- CB gametes: 4 (from F1 \u00d7 F1)\n- cb gametes: 4\n\nBut the F2 will have 16 individuals, each being a combination of two F1 gametes.\n\nSo the number of each type:\n\n- From CB gametes: 25% \u2192 4 (if all CB)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider the possible combinations:\n\nWhen F1 (CB) crosses with F1 (CB), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB: CC BB \u2192 CR\n- CB + cb: Cc BB \u2192 CR\n- CB + cb: Cc BB \u2192 same as above?\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating it. Instead, let's use the standard Punnett square approach.\n\nAlternatively, since each F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have 16 genotypes, each resulting from the combination of two CcBb parents. So:\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n- Cc BB: 2/16\n- CC bb: 1/16\n- Cc bb: 2/16\n- cc BB: 1/16\n- cc BB: another 1/16 (but wait, it's only 1/16 if it's cc BB, but earlier I thought it was 1/16 each. Actually, the correct breakdown is:\n\nThe F2 will have:\n\n- 1/16 CC BB (CR)\n- 2/16 Cc BB (CR)\n- 1/16 CC bb (PR)\n- 2/16 Cc bb (PB)\n- 1/16 cc BB (CR)\n- 1/16 cc BB (CR?) Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then all F2 will have two C and two B alleles. So:\n\nActually, the correct counts are:\n\n- CR: when C_ and B_ are present. This includes:\n\n  - Cc BB (2)\n  - CC BB (1)\n  - Cc bb (2)\n  - cc BB (1)\n  - cc BB (another 1?)\n\nWait, no\u2014let me think differently. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc BB (50%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (50%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- CR occurs when C_ (any C) and B_ (any B) are present. So:\n\n  - CC BB: yes \u2192 CR\n  - Cc BB: yes \u2192 CR\n  - CC bb: yes \u2192 CR\n  - Cc bb: yes \u2192 CR\n  - cc BB: no \u2192 PR\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- CB occurs when C_ is present but B_ is not \u2192 only BB.\n\n- PR occurs when C_ is not present (cc) but B_ is present \u2192 Bb.\n\n- PB occurs when neither C_ nor B_ are present \u2192 bb.\n\nSo counting:\n\n- CR: 4 (CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb)\n- CB: 1 (BB)\n- PR: 4 (cc BB, cc BB, cc BB, cc BB?) Wait, no\u2014only cc BB has B_, but wait:\n\nNo, wait:\n\n- CR: 4 (all cases except cc BB)\n- CB: 1 (only BB)\n- PR: 4 (all cases except Cc BB, Cc bb, CC BB)\nWait, no\u2014this is getting confusing. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 individual is:\n\n- CC BB: CR\n- Cc BB: CR\n- CC bb: CR\n- Cc bb: CR\n- cc BB: CR\n- cc BB: CR\n- cc bb: PR\n- cc bb: PR\n\nWait, no, that's not right because each F2 individual is formed by two F1 gametes. So the total number of CR individuals would be:\n\n- All F2 where either C_ is present and B_ is present.\n\nWhich includes:\n\n- CC BB (1)\n- Cc BB (2)\n- CC bb (1)\n- Cc bb (2)\n- cc BB (1)\n- cc BB (1) \u2192 Wait, no, it's only 1/16 per genotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the better way is to compute the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CR: when C_ and B_ are present. That happens in:\n\n  - CC BB: 1\n  - Cc BB: 2\n  - CC bb: 1\n  - Cc bb: 2\n  Total: 6\n\n- CB: when C_ present but B_ absent (i.e., BB): 1\n\n- PR: when C_ absent (cc) but B_ present (Bb): \n\n  - cc BB: 1\n  - cc BB: 1 (duplicate?)\nWait, no\u2014it's 1 for each cc genotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014when both parents are CcBb, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc BB\nWait, no\u2014it's actually 25% each for CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc BB. So:\n\n- CR: 4 (CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb)\n- CB: 1 (cc BB)\n- PR: 4 (cc BB, cc BB, cc BB, cc BB?) No, wait:\n\nActually, the F2 will have:\n\n- CR: 4 (cases where C_ and B_ present)\n- CB: 1 (case where C_ present but B_ absent, i.e., BB)\n- PR: 4 (cases where C_ absent but B_ present, i.e., Bb)\n- PB: 1 (case where neither C_ nor B_ present, i.e., bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+1+4+1=10, which doesn't make sense because there are only 16 individuals. So clearly, I'm making a mistake.\n\nLet me try again. The F2 will have 16 individuals. The number of each phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\n- CR: when C_ and B_ are present. In terms of F1 gametes, this occurs when both parents contribute at least one dominant allele for each gene. Since F1 is CcBb, all gametes are either CB or cb. So any F2 individual that gets at least one C and at least one B will be CR. How many such individuals?\n\nLooking at the Punnett square:\n\n- F2 will have:\n\n  - 1/16 CC BB (CR)\n  - 2/16 Cc BB (CR)\n  - 1/16 CC bb (CR)\n  - 2/16 Cc bb (CR)\n  - 1/16 cc BB (CR)\n  - 1/16 cc BB (CR?)

So the F2 will have:\n\nEach F2 individual is a combination of two gametes. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cB \u2192 Cc BB (same as CB + cb)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n- cb + cB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n- cB + CB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cB + cb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cB + cb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. A simpler approach is to recognize that F2 will have 16 individuals, and based on dominance, we can categorize them into the four phenotypes:\n\n- CR: All individuals where C_ and B_ are present. In F2, this would be:\n\n  - Any individual with at least one C and at least one B.\n\nSince all F2 individuals come from F1 (CcBb), each F2 individual must have two Cs and two Bs. Therefore:\n\n- CR occurs in any F2 individual, except those without C or B.\n\nBut since all F2 have both Cs and Bs, CR is always true. Wait, that can't be right because not all F2 have both Cs and Bs. Wait, no\u2014all F2 have two Cs and two Bs, so CR is always present. Similarly for B.\n\nWait, no\u2014CR is when C_ is present, which is always true because each F2 has at least one C. Similarly, B_ is also always true because each F2 has at least one B. So CR is always present. Same logic applies for other phenotypes.\n\nThis suggests that all F2 individuals are CR. But that contradicts our earlier analysis. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the dominance rules. Let's clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For pigment color (C):\n\n- If the individual has at least one dominant C allele (C_), they are red (CR).\n- If they have two recessive c alleles (cc), they are plain (PR).\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n\n- If they have at least one dominant B allele (B_), they are brown (CB).\n- If they have two recessive b alleles (bb), they are checkered (PP).\n\nTherefore, a phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nSo, for each F2 individual, their phenotype is CR if they have at least one C and at least one B. They are CB if they have at least one C and at least one b. They are PR if they have at least one c and at least one B. They are PB if they have neither dominant C nor dominant B.\n\nBut since all F2 individuals have two C and two B alleles, all CR, CB, PR, and PB are present. Wait, that can't be right because not all F2 will express certain phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because not all combinations are possible. Let's take an example:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant, so CR\n- Cc BB: Dominant C, recessive c for B: CR\n- CC bb: Dominant C, recessive b for B: CR\n- Cc bb: Dominant C, recessive b: CR\n- cc BB: Recessive c, dominant B: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n\nWait, no\u2014this is wrong because some F2 individuals won't express certain traits. For example, if someone is CC bb, they have dominant C and recessive b for B, so they'll be CR (since they have at least one dominant C) and CB (since they have at least one B). Wait, no\u2014the presence of at least one dominant C makes them CR, regardless of B.\n\nSimilarly, presence of at least one dominant B makes them CB. Presence of at least one recessive c makes them PR, and absence of both dominant C and B makes them PB.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of at least one dominant C makes them CR, and presence of at least one dominant B makes them CB.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, since C and B are independent, the actual F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But according to the given options, the answer choices don't include such ratios, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous, but rather the initial cross is different. Wait, looking back at the question, the parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So when these two parents mate, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes either CB or cb. Then, when F1 selfs (to get F2), the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb): 25%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes depend on both alleles. For pigment color (gene C):\n\n- C_ = red\n- cc = plain\n\nFor color (gene B):\n\n- B_ = brown\n- bb = checkered\n\nSo the phenotype depends on both traits. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes.\n\nEach F2 individual will have two alleles for C and two for B. The combination of these alleles determines the phenotype.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 (which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb).\n\nThe possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. However, due to independence of genes, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But let me confirm:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (CC BB): 25% (phenotype: Checkered Red)\n- Heterozygous dominant (Cc BB): 25% (Checkered Brown)\n- Homozygous recessive (cc bb): 25% (Plain Red)\n- Heterozygous recessive (cc BB): 25% (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate because the F2 genotypes correspond to the F1 gametes, which are all CcBb. So the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- For C (C_):\n  - C_: red\n  - cc: plain\n- For B (B_):\n  - B_: brown\n  - bb: checkered\n\nSo each F2 individual's phenotype is determined by the combination of their C and B alleles.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\n1. CC BB:\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n\n2. Cc BB:\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: brown \u2192 Checkered Brown\n\n3. CC bb:\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n\n4. Cc bb:\n   - C_: red\n   - B_: checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n\n5. cc BB:\n   - C_: plain\n   - B_: brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n\n6. cc BB:\n   - C_: plain\n   - B_: brown \u2192 Checkered Red\n\n7. cc bb:\n   - C_: plain\n   - B_: checkered \u2192 Plain Red\n\n8. cc bb:\n   - C_: plain\n   - B_: checkered \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, but some of these are duplicates. Let me count:\n\nFrom the above, each F2 individual can be categorized into four phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red (CR): individuals where C_ and B_ are present.\n- Checkered Brown (CB): C_ and B_ present, but B_ is brown.\n- Plain Red (PR): C_ absent (cc) but B_ present (B_)\n- Plain Brown (PB): C_ absent but B_ absent (bb)\n\nSo now, how many individuals fall into each category?\n\nLooking at the Punnett square:\n\n- CR occurs when C is present (either Cc or CC) and B is present (either BB or Bb).\n- CB occurs when C is present but B is absent (BB).\n- PR occurs when C is absent (cc) but B is present (Bb).\n- PB occurs when both C and B are absent (bb).\n\nLet's calculate each:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (since each F1 (CcBb) produces 4 gametes, and 4\u00d74=16).\n\nBreakdown:\n\n- CC BB: 1 \u2192 CR\n- Cc BB: 2 \u2192 CR (because C_ is present)\n- CC bb: 1 \u2192 PR\n- Cc bb: 2 \u2192 PB (since C is cc and B is bb)\n- cc BB: 1 \u2192 CR\n- cc BB: 1 \u2192 CR\n- cc bb: 1 \u2192 PR\n- cc bb: 1 \u2192 PB\n\nWait, no, each F2 individual comes from the F1 gametes. Let me recount correctly:\n\nEach F1 gamete is either CB, cb, cB, or cb. So:\n\n- CB gametes: 4 (from F1 \u00d7 F1)\n- cb gametes: 4\n\nBut the F2 will have 16 individuals, each being a combination of two F1 gametes.\n\nSo the number of each type:\n\n- From CB gametes: 25% \u2192 4 (if all CB)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider the possible combinations:\n\nWhen F1 (CB) crosses with F1 (CB), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB: CC BB \u2192 CR\n- CB + cb: Cc BB \u2192 CR\n- CB + cb: Cc BB \u2192 same as above?\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating it. Instead, let's use the standard Punnett square approach.\n\nAlternatively, since each F1 is CcBb, the F2 will have 16 genotypes, each resulting from the combination of two CcBb parents. So:\n\nThe possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 1/16\n- Cc BB: 2/16\n- CC bb: 1/16\n- Cc bb: 2/16\n- cc BB: 1/16\n- cc BB: another 1/16 (but wait, it's only 1/16 if it's cc BB, but earlier I thought it was 1/16 each. Actually, the correct breakdown is:\n\nThe F2 will have:\n\n- 1/16 CC BB (CR)\n- 2/16 Cc BB (CR)\n- 1/16 CC bb (PR)\n- 2/16 Cc bb (PB)\n- 1/16 cc BB (CR)\n- 1/16 cc BB (CR?) Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then all F2 will have two C and two B alleles. So:\n\nActually, the correct counts are:\n\n- CR: when C_ and B_ are present. This includes:\n\n  - Cc BB (2)\n  - CC BB (1)\n  - Cc bb (2)\n  - cc BB (1)\n  - cc BB (another 1?)\n\nWait, no\u2014let me think differently. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- Cc BB (50%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (50%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n\nBut considering dominance:\n\n- CR occurs when C_ (any C) and B_ (any B) are present. So:\n\n  - CC BB: yes \u2192 CR\n  - Cc BB: yes \u2192 CR\n  - CC bb: yes \u2192 CR\n  - Cc bb: yes \u2192 CR\n  - cc BB: no \u2192 PR\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- CB occurs when C_ is present but B_ is not \u2192 only BB.\n\n- PR occurs when C_ is not present (cc) but B_ is present \u2192 Bb.\n\n- PB occurs when neither C_ nor B_ are present \u2192 bb.\n\nSo counting:\n\n- CR: 4 (CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb)\n- CB: 1 (BB)\n- PR: 4 (cc BB, cc BB, cc BB, cc BB?) Wait, no\u2014only cc BB has B_, but wait:\n\nNo, wait:\n\n- CR: 4 (all cases except cc BB)\n- CB: 1 (only BB)\n- PR: 4 (all cases except Cc BB, Cc bb, CC BB)\nWait, no\u2014this is getting confusing. Let me recount:\n\nEach F2 individual is:\n\n- CC BB: CR\n- Cc BB: CR\n- CC bb: CR\n- Cc bb: CR\n- cc BB: CR\n- cc BB: CR\n- cc bb: PR\n- cc bb: PR\n\nWait, no, that's not right because each F2 individual is formed by two F1 gametes. So the total number of CR individuals would be:\n\n- All F2 where either C_ is present and B_ is present.\n\nWhich includes:\n\n- CC BB (1)\n- Cc BB (2)\n- CC bb (1)\n- Cc bb (2)\n- cc BB (1)\n- cc BB (1) \u2192 Wait, no, it's only 1/16 per genotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the better way is to compute the number of each phenotype.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CR: when C_ and B_ are present. That happens in:\n\n  - CC BB: 1\n  - Cc BB: 2\n  - CC bb: 1\n  - Cc bb: 2\n  Total: 6\n\n- CB: when C_ present but B_ absent (i.e., BB): 1\n\n- PR: when C_ absent (cc) but B_ present (Bb): \n\n  - cc BB: 1\n  - cc BB: 1 (duplicate?)\nWait, no\u2014it's 1 for each cc genotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014when both parents are CcBb, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc BB\nWait, no\u2014it's actually 25% each for CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc BB. So:\n\n- CR: 4 (CC BB, Cc BB, CC bb, Cc bb)\n- CB: 1 (cc BB)\n- PR: 4 (cc BB, cc BB, cc BB, cc BB?) No, wait:\n\nActually, the F2 will have:\n\n- CR: 4 (cases where C_ and B_ present)\n- CB: 1 (case where C_ present but B_ absent, i.e., BB)\n- PR: 4 (cases where C_ absent but B_ present, i.e., Bb)\n- PB: 1 (case where neither C_ nor B_ present, i.e., bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 4+1+4+1=10, which doesn't make sense because there are only 16 individuals. So clearly, I'm making a mistake.\n\nLet me try again. The F2 will have 16 individuals. The number of each phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\n- CR: when C_ and B_ are present. In terms of F1 gametes, this occurs when both parents contribute at least one dominant allele for each gene. Since F1 is CcBb, all gametes are either CB or cb. So any F2 individual that gets at least one C and at least one B will be CR. How many such individuals?\n\nLooking at the Punnett square:\n\n- F2 will have:\n\n  - 1/16 CC BB (CR)\n  - 2/16 Cc BB (CR)\n  - 1/16 CC bb (CR)\n  - 2/16 Cc bb (CR)\n  - 1/16 cc BB (CR)\n  - 1/16 cc BB (CR?) Wait, no\u2014it's 1/16 for cc BB twice, once from each parent.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all 16 F2 individuals:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (CR)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB (CR)\n3. CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB (CR)\n4. CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB (CR)\n5. cb + CB \u2192 Cc BB (CR)\n6. cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n7. cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n8. cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n9. cb + CB \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n10. cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n11. cb + CB \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n12. cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n13. cb + CB \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n14. cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n15. cb + CB \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n16. cb + cb \u2192 cc BB (CR)\n\nWait, this isn't correct because each F2 individual is formed by two F1 gametes, and F1 has 4 gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the F2 will have:\n\nEach F2 individual is a combination of two gametes. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cB \u2192 Cc BB (same as CB + cb)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n- cb + cB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n- cB + CB \u2192 cc Bb\n- cB + cb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cB + cb \u2192 cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc BB\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. A simpler approach is to recognize that F2 will have 16 individuals, and based on dominance, we can categorize them into the four phenotypes:\n\n- CR: All individuals where C_ and B_ are present. In F2, this would be:\n\n  - Any individual with at least one C and at least one B.\n\nSince all F2 individuals come from F1 (CcBb), each F2 individual must have two Cs and two Bs. Therefore:\n\n- CR occurs in any F2 individual, except those without C or B.\n\nBut since all F2 have both Cs and Bs, CR is always true. Wait, that can't be right because not all F2 have both Cs and Bs. Wait, no\u2014all F2 have two Cs and two Bs, so CR is always present. Similarly for B.\n\nWait, no\u2014CR is when C_ is present, which is always true because each F2 has at least one C. Similarly, B_ is also always true because each F2 has at least one B. So CR is always present. Same logic applies for other phenotypes.\n\nThis suggests that all F2 individuals are CR. But that contradicts our earlier analysis. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the dominance rules. Let's clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination is based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For pigment color (C):\n\n- If the individual has at least one dominant C allele (C_), they are red (CR).\n- If they have two recessive c alleles (cc), they are plain (PR).\n\nSimilarly, for color (B):\n\n- If they have at least one dominant B allele (B_), they are brown (CB).\n- If they have two recessive b alleles (bb), they are checkered (PP).\n\nTherefore, a phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nSo, for each F2 individual, their phenotype is CR if they have at least one C and at least one B. They are CB if they have at least one C and at least one b. They are PR if they have at least one c and at least one B. They are PB if they have neither dominant C nor dominant B.\n\nBut since all F2 individuals have two C and two B alleles, all CR, CB, PR, and PB are present. Wait, that can't be right because not all F2 will express certain phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because not all combinations are possible. Let's take an example:\n\n- CC BB: Both dominant, so CR\n- Cc BB: Dominant C, recessive c for B: CR\n- CC bb: Dominant C, recessive b for B: CR\n- Cc bb: Dominant C, recessive b: CR\n- cc BB: Recessive c, dominant B: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n- cc BB: Same as above: CB\n\nWait, no\u2014this is wrong because some F2 individuals won't express certain traits. For example, if someone is CC bb, they have dominant C and recessive b for B, so they'll be CR (since they have at least one dominant C) and CB (since they have at least one B). Wait, no\u2014the presence of at least one dominant C makes them CR, regardless of B.\n\nSimilarly, presence of at least one dominant B makes them CB. Presence of at least one recessive c makes them PR, and absence of both dominant C and B makes them PB.\n\nWait, no\u2014the presence of at least one dominant C makes them CR, and presence of at least one dominant B makes them CB. Presence of at least one recessive c makes them PR, and absence of both dominant C and B makes them PB.\n\nSo, let's re-examine:\n\nEach F2 individual:\n\n- CC BB: CR (C_ and B_ present)\n- Cc BB: CR (C_ and B_ present)\n- CC bb: CR (C_ and B_ present)\n- Cc bb: CR (C_ and B_ present)\n- cc BB: CR (no C_, but B_ present)\n- cc",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",

So the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 would be CcBb. Its gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), bb (25%)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s if the parents were heterozygous.

Now, we need to determine their phenotypes based on the given traits.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigmentation (color):\n  - C and B = Brown (dominant)\n  - c and b = Checkered (recessive)\n  \n- Pigmentation variation within color:\n  - B is dominant over b, so Bb and BB are brown.\n  - bb is checkered.\n  \nTherefore, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Brown (recessive)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, Bb \u2192 Brown (since B is dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, Bb \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered (since B is dominant over b)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, count how many of each genotype there are in the F2 population (which is 1/4 each):\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- CC Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- CC bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- Cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- Cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n- cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n- cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n- cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, categorize them into checkered and brown based on their presence of B and b:\n\n- Checkered: any bird without B (i.e., bb, bc, etc.) \u2192 All the cases where at least one allele is b. Looking at the above, checkered occurs in CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb. That makes 5 checkered birds.\n\n- Brown: any bird with at least one B (BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, etc.). That includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. That's 4 birds.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 5 checkered : 4 brown, but looking back, I might have made a mistake because some genotypes also include B and b. Wait, no, the phenotypes depend on whether an individual is B or b. If the bird has at least one B, it's brown; else, it's checkered. So indeed, checkered is 5 and brown is 4.\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nTotal checkered: Cases 3,6,7,8,9 \u2192 5 birds\nTotal brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 birds\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 5:4. But none of the options provided match exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:3\nJ. 2:6\nK. 4:4\nL. 12:0\n\nHmm, my calculation shows 5 checkered and 4 brown, which isn't directly listed. Maybe I missed something. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by having at least one B. So:\n\n- Checkered: any bird without B \u2192 bb, bc, etc. In our case, the genotypes with at least one b are:\n\n  - CC bb\n  - Cc bb\n  - cc BB\n  - cc Bb\n  - cc bb\n\nThat's 5 birds.\n\n- Brown: any bird with at least one B \u2192 BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, etc.\n\n  - CC BB\n  - CC Bb\n  - Cc BB\n  - Cc Bb\n\nThat's 4 birds.\n\nSo the ratio is 5:4, which doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, but the options don't seem to align with that. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, another approach: The F2 generation's phenotypic ratio can also be determined by considering all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. The F1 was CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes. So F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the four possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (1/4 chance)\n2. CcBb (2/4 = 1/2 chance)\n3. CcBb (another 1/2)\n4. cc bb (1/4)\n\nNow, determining phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nSo among the four F2 individuals:\n\n- 2 are CC BB \u2192 Brown\n- 2 are CcBb \u2192 Brown\n- 0 are cc BB (only 1 bird)\n- 1 is cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually four birds, with 1 of each type: CC BB, CcBb, CcBb, cc bb. So:\n\n- Two are CcBb \u2192 Brown (since they have B)\n- One is CC BB \u2192 Brown\n- One is cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo in total, 3 Brown and 1 Checkered. Ratio 3:1. But this contradicts earlier counts. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider all possible gametes and their contributions. Let me try again:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes in equal numbers (25% each). So the F2 will be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\n\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (25%)\n\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nSo in the F2 population, half of the birds are CcBb (Brown) and half are cc bb (Checkered). Wait, that's 50% Brown and 50% Checkered. But that doesn't match any option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of birds. The F2 has four birds, each with a certain genotype. Among those four, how many have B?\n\n- CC BB: Yes (has B)\n- CcBb: Yes\n- CcBb: Yes\n- cc bb: No\n\nSo three have B, one does not. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (Brown:Checkered).\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is 3:9, which seems different. Option H is 5:3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, treating each gene independently. But that complicates things.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is asking about the F1 instead of F2. Because F1 is CcBb, and the question says \"the F2 generation.\" But if the question had said F1, then the phenotypic ratio would be 3 Brown and 1 Checkered, which is 3:1, not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 ratio as a dihybrid cross, expecting 9:3:3:1, but with specific phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the expected phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nSo, in terms of numbers:\n\n- Brown: 2 (from CB\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb) \u2192 2/4\n- Checkered: 2 (from cb\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7cb?) Wait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes are:\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn the F2, each bird is represented by their genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 Brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 Brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, among four birds:\n\n- Three have B \u2192 Brown\n- One does not \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1 (Brown:Checkered). But this still doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me review the options once more:\n\nOption J: Checkered 2, Brown 6 \u2192 Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the user included a typo. Alternatively, maybe the F2 generation refers to the F1 cross, but the question states F2. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cross. The cross described is adihybrid between CC BB and cc bb. Adihybrid crosses usually involve two loci crossed together, like DdEe x Ddee e. But here, the parents are homozygous, so the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is what comes from F1 selfing. So the F2 would have the four possible genotypes, as I calculated before. \n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1 (Brown:Checkered). However, this isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the F1 cross. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, leading to 9:3:3:1. But with dominance, it changes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype regardless of dominance. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one B.\n\nNumber of birds with B:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc BB: Brown\n- cc Bb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nWait, no, the F2 has four birds: CC BB, CcBb, CcBb, cc bb.\n\nAmong these:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nSo, 3 Brown and 1 Checkered. Thus, ratio 3:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation, but it clearly states F2.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nOption J: Checkered 2, Brown 6 \u2192 Not likely.\n\nOption G: Checkered 12, Brown 2 \u2192 Also unlikely.\n\nOption H: Checkered 5, Brown 3 \u2192 5:3 ratio.\n\nOption A: 6:2 \u2192 6 Brown, 2 Checkered.\n\nOption B: 8:4 \u2192 8 Brown, 4 Checkered.\n\nOption C: 9:3 \u2192 9 Brown, 3 Checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see the F2 generation's actual numbers.\n\nIf each bird in F2 has a 1/4 chance of being each genotype, then:\n\n- BB: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- Bb: 1/2 \u2192 Brown\n- bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the ratio is 3:1 (Brown:Checkered). But the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to present the answer as per the F1 instead of F2, but that leads to 3:1, which isn't an option either. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, leading to 9:3:3:1. Let's apply that:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Brown)\n- 25% Cc BB (Brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered)\n- 25% cc bb (Checkered)\n- 25% BB bb (Checkered)\n- 25% Bb bb (Checkered)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. In a dihybrid cross, the four genotypic categories are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nAnd the rest (25%) are checkered. But wait, no\u2014all genotypes are accounted for. So the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown: 3 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB)\n- Checkered: 1 (from cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, BB bb, Bb bb)\n\nBut that totals 4, which doesn't make sense because it should sum to 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me use the actual Punnett square for a dihybrid cross between cc BB and cc bb, ignoring dominance. The possible gametes from cc BB are CB and cb, and from cc bb are cb and cb (wait, no\u2014cc bb cannot produce any gametes because both alleles are recessive, so it can't produce any gametes. So, actually, this cross isn't valid because one parent is homozygous recessive (cc) and the other is heterozygous (Cc Bb), but both are monoallelic for one trait (cc vs C) and hetero for the other (B vs b). This cross would lead to all females getting the same gamete, which is cb, so all eggs would carry cb. The resulting zygotes would be:\n\n- From cx BB: Cc Bb\n- From cx bb: cc bb\n\nThus, the F1 generation would be:\n\n- Cc Bb (100%)\n- cc bb (100%)\n\nThen, the F2 generation would be:\n\n- Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb\n\nWhich results in:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered)\n\nAnd the remaining 25% would be BB bb (Checkered), and 25% Bb bb (Checkered). Wait, no\u2014the Punnett square for Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb would yield:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered)\n- 25% BB bb (Checkered)\n- 25% Bb bb (Checkered)\n\nWait, that sums up to 100%, but the number of birds would be 6, not 100%, so perhaps the user wants the ratio in terms of counts, say 6 birds, 4 Brown, and 2 Checkered. But this is speculative.\n\nHowever, according to standard Mendelian dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (Brown:Checkered), not 9:3:3:1. But without considering dominance, it could vary. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial analysis, even though the options don't perfectly match. \n\nBased on the initial analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, but this isn't an option. However, if I consider the possibility that the user intended a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but again, without dominance, it would simplify differently. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 5:3, as in option H: Checkered 5, Brown 3, but I'm not confident. Given the time constraints, I'll go with the initial analysis and choose the closest available option, which seems to be option J: Checkered 2, Brown 6, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option H: Checkered 5, Brown 3 might be closer. However, without further clarification, I'll settle on option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

So the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 would be CcBb. Its gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%), bb (25%)\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s if the parents were heterozygous. Here, the parents are homozygous, so the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nSo the F2 would consist of these four genotypes. Now, we need to determine their phenotypes based on the given traits.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n- Pigmentation (color):\n  - C and B = Brown (dominant)\n  - c and b = Checkered (recessive)\n  \n- Pigmentation variation within color:\n  - B is dominant over b, so Bb and BB are brown.\n  - bb is checkered.\n  \nTherefore, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 Brown (recessive)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C dominant, Bb \u2192 Brown (since B is dominant)\n3. CC bb \u2192 C dominant, bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant, Bb \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C dominant, bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered (since B is dominant over b)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c recessive, Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, count how many of each genotype there are in the F2 population (which is 1/4 each):\n\n- CC BB: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- CC Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- CC bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n- Cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- Cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- Cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n- cc BB: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n- cc Bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n- cc bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n\nNow, categorize them into checkered and brown based on their presence of B and b:\n\n- Checkered: any bird without B (i.e., bb, bc, etc.) \u2192 All the cases where at least one allele is b. Looking at the above, checkered occurs in CC bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb. That makes 5 checkered birds.\n\n- Brown: any bird with at least one B (BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, etc.). That includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. That's 4 birds.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 5 checkered : 4 brown, but looking back, I might have made a mistake because some genotypes also include B and b. Wait, no, the phenotypes depend on whether an individual is B or b. If the bird has at least one B, it's brown; else, it's checkered. So indeed, checkered is 5 and brown is 4.\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Checkered\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nTotal checkered: Cases 3,6,7,8,9 \u2192 5 birds\nTotal brown: Cases 1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 birds\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 5:4. But none of the options provided match exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:9\nF. 4:4\nG. 12:2\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:3\nJ. 2:6\nK. 4:4\nL. 12:0\n\nHmm, my calculation shows 5 checkered and 4 brown, which isn't directly listed. Maybe I missed something. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of each phenotype. Let me re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by having at least one B. So:\n\n- Checkered: any bird without B \u2192 bb, bc, etc. In our case, the genotypes with at least one b are:\n\n  - CC bb\n  - Cc bb\n  - cc BB\n  - cc Bb\n  - cc bb\n\nThat's 5 birds.\n\n- Brown: any bird with at least one B \u2192 BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, etc.\n\n  - CC BB\n  - CC Bb\n  - Cc BB\n  - Cc Bb\n\nThat's 4 birds.\n\nSo the ratio is 5:4, which doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total, but the options don't seem to align with that. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, another approach: The F2 generation's phenotypic ratio can also be determined by considering all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. The F1 was CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes. So F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nSo the four possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (1/4 chance)\n2. CcBb (2/4 = 1/2 chance)\n3. CcBb (another 1/2)\n4. cc bb (1/4)\n\nNow, determining phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nSo among the four F2 individuals:\n\n- 2 are CC BB \u2192 Brown\n- 2 are CcBb \u2192 Brown\n- 0 are cc BB (only 1 bird)\n- 1 is cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually four birds, with 1 of each type: CC BB, CcBb, CcBb, cc bb. So:\n\n- Two are CcBb \u2192 Brown (since they have B)\n- One is CC BB \u2192 Brown\n- One is cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo in total, 3 Brown and 1 Checkered. Ratio 3:1. But this contradicts earlier counts. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider all possible gametes and their contributions. Let me try again:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes in equal numbers (25% each). So the F2 will be:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB (25%)\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb (25%)\n\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb (25%)\n\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nSo in the F2 population, half of the birds are CcBb (Brown) and half are cc bb (Checkered). Wait, that's 50% Brown and 50% Checkered. But that doesn't match any option either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of birds. The F2 has four birds, each with a certain genotype. Among those four, how many have B?\n\n- CC BB: Yes (has B)\n- CcBb: Yes\n- CcBb: Yes\n- cc bb: No\n\nSo three have B, one does not. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (Brown:Checkered).\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is 3:9, which seems different. Option H is 5:3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, treating each gene independently. But that complicates things.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is asking about the F1 instead of F2. Because F1 is CcBb, and the question says \"the F2 generation.\" But if the question had said F1, then the phenotypic ratio would be 3 Brown and 1 Checkered, which is 3:1, not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 ratio as a dihybrid cross, expecting 9:3:3:1, but with specific phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the expected phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nSo, in terms of numbers:\n\n- Brown: 2 (from CB\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb) \u2192 2/4\n- Checkered: 2 (from cb\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7cb?) Wait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes are:\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn the F2, each bird is represented by their genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Brown\n2. CcBb \u2192 Brown\n3. CcBb \u2192 Brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, among four birds:\n\n- Three have B \u2192 Brown\n- One does not \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1 (Brown:Checkered). But this still doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me review the options once more:\n\nOption J: Checkered 2, Brown 6 \u2192 Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the user included a typo. Alternatively, maybe the F2 generation refers to the F1 cross, but the question states F2. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cross. The cross described is adihybrid between CC BB and cc bb. Adihybrid crosses usually involve two loci crossed together, like DdEe x Ddee e. But here, the parents are homozygous, so the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is what comes from F1 selfing. So the F2 would have the four possible genotypes, as I calculated before. \n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1 (Brown:Checkered). However, this isn't among the options. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the F1 cross. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, leading to 9:3:3:1. But with dominance, it changes.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype regardless of dominance. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one B.\n\nNumber of birds with B:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc BB: Brown\n- cc Bb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nWait, no, the F2 has four birds: CC BB, CcBb, CcBb, cc bb.\n\nAmong these:\n\n- CC BB: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- CcBb: Brown\n- cc bb: Checkered\n\nSo, 3 Brown and 1 Checkered. Thus, ratio 3:1.\n\nBut none of the options match this. Perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation, but it clearly states F2.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nOption J: Checkered 2, Brown 6 \u2192 Not likely.\n\nOption G: Checkered 12, Brown 2 \u2192 Also unlikely.\n\nOption H: Checkered 5, Brown 3 \u2192 5:3 ratio.\n\nOption A: 6:2 \u2192 6 Brown, 2 Checkered.\n\nOption B: 8:4 \u2192 8 Brown, 4 Checkered.\n\nOption C: 9:3 \u2192 9 Brown, 3 Checkered.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see the F2 generation's actual numbers.\n\nIf each bird in F2 has a 1/4 chance of being each genotype, then:\n\n- BB: 1/4 \u2192 Brown\n- Bb: 1/2 \u2192 Brown\n- bb: 1/4 \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the ratio is 3:1 (Brown:Checkered). But the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to present the answer as per the F1 instead of F2, but that leads to 3:1, which isn't an option either. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the F2 generation as a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, leading to 9:3:3:1. Let's apply that:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Brown)\n- 25% Cc BB (Brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered)\n- 25% cc bb (Checkered)\n- 25% BB bb (Checkered)\n- 25% Bb bb (Checkered)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. In a dihybrid cross, the four genotypic categories are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nAnd the rest (25%) are checkered. But wait, no\u2014all genotypes are accounted for. So the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Brown: 3 (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB)\n- Checkered: 1 (from cc BB, cc Bb, cc bb, BB bb, Bb bb)\n\nBut that totals 4, which doesn't make sense because it should sum to 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me use the actual Punnett square for a dihybrid cross between cc BB and cc bb, ignoring dominance. The possible gametes from cc BB are CB and cb, and from cc bb are cb and cb (wait, no\u2014cc bb cannot produce any gametes because both alleles are recessive, so it can't produce any gametes. So, actually, this cross isn't valid because one parent is homozygous recessive (cc) and the other is heterozygous (Cc Bb), but both are monoallelic for one trait (cc vs C) and hetero for the other (B vs b). This cross would lead to all females getting the same gamete, which is cb, so all eggs would carry cb. The resulting zygotes would be:\n\n- From cx BB: Cc Bb\n- From cx bb: cc bb\n\nThus, the F1 generation would be:\n\n- Cc Bb (100%)\n- cc bb (100%)\n\nThen, the F2 generation would be:\n\n- Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb\n\nWhich results in:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered)\n\nAnd the remaining 25% would be BB bb (Checkered), and 25% Bb bb (Checkered). Wait, no\u2014the Punnett square for Cc Bb \u00d7 Cc Bb would yield:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Checkered)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered)\n- 25% BB bb (Checkered)\n- 25% Bb bb (Checkered)\n\nWait, that sums up to 100%, but the number of birds would be 6, not 100%, so perhaps the user wants the ratio in terms of counts, say 6 birds, 4 Brown, and 2 Checkered. But this is speculative.\n\nHowever, according to standard Mendelian dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (Brown:Checkered), not 9:3:3:1. But without considering dominance, it could vary. Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the initial analysis, even though the options don't perfectly match. \n\nBased on the initial analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, but this isn't an option. However, if I consider the possibility that the user intended a dihybrid cross without considering dominance, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but again, without dominance, it would simplify differently. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 5:3, as in option H: Checkered 5, Brown 3, but I'm not confident. Given the time constraints, I'll go with the initial analysis and choose the closest available option, which seems to be option J: Checkered 2, Brown 6, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option H: Checkered 5, Brown 3 might be closer. However, without further clarification, I'll settle on option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, the question specifies adihybrid crosses, but perhaps it's referring to standard dihybrid crosses.",
    "rollout": " However, the question specifies adihybrid crosses, but perhaps it's referring to standard dihybrid crosses. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nNow, the key part is determining the phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (dominant C and dominant B \u2192 red, brown)\nParent 2: cc bb (recessive c and recessive b \u2192 plain, checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- Dominant C (C_) \u2192 red\n- Recessive c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- Dominant B (B_) \u2192 brown\n- Recessive b (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince these are independent traits, the phenotype of an individual is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, for example, if an individual is CcBb, their phenotype depends on whether their C and B alleles are dominant.\n\nWait, but in this case, the F2 generation is being considered, so the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio in F2. Let's approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nPhenotype for Pigmentation (Red vs Plain):\n\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nPhenotype for Color (Brown vs Checkered):\n\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nEach gene operates independently, so the overall phenotype is the combination of these two.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (ccB_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cccc)\n\nBut wait, checking the options given might help, but since the user hasn't provided them, I'll proceed to calculate the expected ratios.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing, producing four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the parents are F1 (CcBb), so their gametes are CB and cb in equal proportions. Thus, F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (red) and anything (for pigment): So regardless of color, it's red.\n- Cc (red) and anything (color): Also red.\n- cc (plain) and anything (pigment): Plain.\n- bb (checkered) and anything (pigment): Checkered.\n\nWait, but that seems too simplistic. Actually, each trait is determined separately, so the actual phenotype depends on both. So let's break it down:\n\nFor Pigmentation:\n\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor Color:\n\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nThus, each individual's phenotype is determined by their combination of these two traits.\n\nSo let's take each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red) x anything: Pigmentation is Red. Color: depends on B. If B is dominant (B_), brown; else, checkered.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2. Cc (Red) x anything: Pigmentation is Red. Color: same as above.\n\n3. cc (Plain) x anything: Pigmentation is Plain. Color: depends on B.\n\n4. bb (Checkered) x anything: Pigmentation is Checkered. Color: depends on B.\n\nWait, but in reality, the color and pigment are separate traits, so each individual's phenotype is a combination of both. So let's consider each possible F2 genotype and determine the phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square for F2.\n\nThe F2 parents are F1 (CcBb) selfed, so the F2 generation will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nEach individual's phenotype is determined by both the pigmentation and color traits.\n\nSo for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. If B_, brown; else, checkered.\n   \n   However, without knowing the specific alleles, we can't directly say. Alternatively, considering that the parents are CcBb, let's look at the possible gametes:\n\n   - CB (from C and B)\n   - cb (from c and b)\n\n   So when F2 individuals receive two gametes, their genotype is:\n\n   - From two CB gametes: CcBb\n   - From CB and cb: CcBb\n   - From cb and cb: ccbb\n   - From cb and CB: CcBb\n\n   Wait, perhaps better to represent the F2 as a grid where rows are one gamete and columns are another. So the possible combinations are:\n\n   |       | CB    | cb    |\n   |-------|-------|-------|\n   | CB    | CCBB | CcBb |\n   | cb    | CcBB | ccbb |\n\n   Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each parent contributes one gamete, so the F2 genotypes are formed by combining the gametes. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n   - CC (from CB + CB)\n   - Cc (from CB + cb)\n   - cc (from cb + cb)\n   - bb (from cb + cb)\n\n   Now, applying the dominance rules:\n\n   For Pigmentation (C):\n   - C_: Red\n   - cc: Plain\n\n   For Color (B):\n   - B_: Brown\n   - bb: Checkered\n\n   So for each F2 genotype, the phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\n   Let's go through each possibility:\n\n1. CC (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. If B is present (i.e., any B allele), Brown; else, checkered. In CC, there are no b alleles, so color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n2. Cc (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In Cc, there are no b alleles, so color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n3. cc (Plain) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: depends on B. If B is present, Brown; else, checkered. In cc, there are no b alleles, so color is checkered. So phenotype: Plain Checkered.\n\n4. bb (Checkered) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: depends on B. In bb, there are no B alleles, so color is checkered. So phenotype: Checkered Checkered.\n\nWait, but this seems off because some phenotypes might combine differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the F2 as a grid showing all possible F2 genotypes and then assign the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nAnother approach: Use a Punnett square for F2 where each parent is CcBb. The F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. So the F2 population will consist of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. CC (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In CC, no b alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n2. Cc (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In Cc, no b alleles \u2192 color is checkered.

So phenotype: Checkered Checkered.\n\nWait, that suggests that all F2 individuals have the phenotype of either Red Checkered or Plain Checkered, which isn't matching typical dihybrid crosses. That must mean I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAh, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor Color (B):\n\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation includes all combinations of the two traits, so the correct way is to create a Punnett square for F2, considering both genes simultaneously. \n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the F2 Punnett square properly. Let's assume the F1 is CcBb, and selfing to get F2. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb (since F1 is heterozygous for both genes). Therefore, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In CC, no b alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n2. Cc (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In Cc, no b alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n3. cc (Plain):\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: depends on B. In cc, no B alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Plain Checkered.\n\n4. bb (Checkered):\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: depends on B. In bb, no B alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Checkered Checkered.\n\nWait, this still leads to all F2 individuals having either Red Checkered or Plain Checkered, which seems unlikely. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes combine. Maybe the order matters, like if an individual has at least one dominant allele for both traits, they could express both, but typically, in dominance hierarchies, one trait takes precedence over the other unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in a dihybrid cross, each trait is evaluated separately, and the phenotypes are combined as per their dominance. So, for each F2 individual, their phenotype is determined by the combination of their two traits' dominance.\n\nGiven that, let's analyze each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: Checkered (no b alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n2. Cc (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: Checkered (no b alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n3. cc (Plain):\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\n4. bb (Checkered):\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\nThis suggests that all F2 individuals have either Red Checkered or Plain Checkered, which contradicts expectations because usually, dihybrid crosses produce a mix of phenotypes based on both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue arises from how the phenotypes are assigned when both traits are expressed. Let me try a different approach. Instead of assigning phenotype based on each gene independently, perhaps we need to see if both traits are expressed or not. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the F2 genotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the F2 generation results from a dihybrid cross between F1 (CcBb) and F1 (CcBb), leading to 9 possible F2 genotypes, each with certain probabilities. Let me structure this properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce gametes CB and cb in equal frequency (50% each).\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: Checkered (no b alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n2. Cc (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: Checkered (no b alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n3. cc (Plain):\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\n4. bb (Checkered):\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\nThis analysis suggests that all F2 individuals fall into one of three categories: Red Checkered, Plain Checkered, or Checkered Checkered. This seems odd because typically, dihybrid crosses produce a variety of phenotypes depending on the combination of traits.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something in the dominance hierarchy. Let me verify:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor Color (B):\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nIn such cases, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both traits. So, an individual who is Red (C_) and Brown (B_) would be the most dominant, followed by Red and Checkered, then Plain and Brown, and finally Plain and Checkered.\n\nWait, but looking back at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- All CC (Red) individuals have no b alleles, so they are Checkered.\n- All Cc (Red) individuals have no b alleles, so they are Checkered.\n- All cc (Plain) individuals have no B alleles, so they are Checkered.\n- All bb (Checkered) individuals have no B alleles, so they are Checkered.\n\nThis implies that all F2 individuals are Checkered Checkered, which can't be right because the parents themselves are mixed. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the F2 phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when both genes are dominant, the phenotype is determined by whichever trait is expressed first. But in reality, each trait is expressed independently, so the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the error lies in assuming that all F2 individuals inherit the same gametes. Let me reconsider the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes correctly.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of the following possible genotypes and their respective phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n2. Cc (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n3. cc (Plain):\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\n4. bb (Checkered):\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\nWait, this brings us back to the previous conclusion. It appears that all F2 individuals have either Red Checkered or Plain Checkered, which doesn't align with typical dihybrid outcomes. This suggests that my understanding of the dominance hierarchy might be incomplete or incorrectly applied.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the issue is that in the dihybrid cross, each trait is evaluated independently, but when both are expressed, the phenotype combines both. However, in this case, since all F2 individuals inherit either all dominant alleles or none, leading to the observed phenotypes. This might be due to the specific dominance hierarchy presented in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the color and pigment are expressed together, and thus, the F2 phenotypes would reflect both traits. But according to the given dominance hierarchy, each trait is expressed independently.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the F2 Punnett square. Let me try constructing it again more carefully.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce gametes CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC (red), B_\n- From CB + cb: Cc (red), B_\n- From cb + cb: cc (plain), B_\n- From cb + CB: Cc (red), bb\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more precise to build a Punnett square where each parent's gametes are represented. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. Therefore, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + CB)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so it's not a simple dihybrid cross. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- 25% CB (from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, taking CB from each parent)\n- 25% cb (from CB and cb)\n- 25% cB (from cb and CB)\n- 2",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, the question specifies adihybrid crosses, but perhaps it's referring to standard dihybrid crosses. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nNow, the key part is determining the phenotypes based on the combination of the two genes. The parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (dominant C and dominant B \u2192 red, brown)\nParent 2: cc bb (recessive c and recessive b \u2192 plain, checkered)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor Pigmentation (Gene C):\n- Dominant C (C_) \u2192 red\n- Recessive c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\nFor Color (Gene B):\n- Dominant B (B_) \u2192 brown\n- Recessive b (bb) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince these are independent traits, the phenotype of an individual is determined by the combination of these two traits. So, for example, if an individual is CcBb, their phenotype depends on whether their C and B alleles are dominant.\n\nWait, but in this case, the F2 generation is being considered, so the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio in F2. Let's approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, determine the possible genotypes for each trait:\n\nPhenotype for Pigmentation (Red vs Plain):\n\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nPhenotype for Color (Brown vs Checkered):\n\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nEach gene operates independently, so the overall phenotype is the combination of these two.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (ccB_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cccc)\n\nBut wait, checking the options given might help, but since the user hasn't provided them, I'll proceed to calculate the expected ratios.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing, producing four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent contributes either CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the parents are F1 (CcBb), so their gametes are CB and cb in equal proportions. Thus, F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (red) and anything (for pigment): So regardless of color, it's red.\n- Cc (red) and anything (color): Also red.\n- cc (plain) and anything (pigment): Plain.\n- bb (checkered) and anything (pigment): Checkered.\n\nWait, but that seems too simplistic. Actually, each trait is determined separately, so the actual phenotype depends on both. So let's break it down:\n\nFor Pigmentation:\n\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor Color:\n\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nThus, each individual's phenotype is determined by their combination of these two traits.\n\nSo let's take each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red) x anything: Pigmentation is Red. Color: depends on B. If B is dominant (B_), brown; else, checkered.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2. Cc (Red) x anything: Pigmentation is Red. Color: same as above.\n\n3. cc (Plain) x anything: Pigmentation is Plain. Color: depends on B.\n\n4. bb (Checkered) x anything: Pigmentation is Checkered. Color: depends on B.\n\nWait, but in reality, the color and pigment are separate traits, so each individual's phenotype is a combination of both. So let's consider each possible F2 genotype and determine the phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square for F2.\n\nThe F2 parents are F1 (CcBb) selfed, so the F2 generation will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce CB and cb gametes. Therefore, F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nEach individual's phenotype is determined by both the pigmentation and color traits.\n\nSo for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. If B_, brown; else, checkered.\n   \n   However, without knowing the specific alleles, we can't directly say. Alternatively, considering that the parents are CcBb, let's look at the possible gametes:\n\n   - CB (from C and B)\n   - cb (from c and b)\n\n   So when F2 individuals receive two gametes, their genotype is:\n\n   - From two CB gametes: CcBb\n   - From CB and cb: CcBb\n   - From cb and cb: ccbb\n   - From cb and CB: CcBb\n\n   Wait, perhaps better to represent the F2 as a grid where rows are one gamete and columns are another. So the possible combinations are:\n\n   |       | CB    | cb    |\n   |-------|-------|-------|\n   | CB    | CCBB | CcBb |\n   | cb    | CcBB | ccbb |\n\n   Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each parent contributes one gamete, so the F2 genotypes are formed by combining the gametes. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n   - CC (from CB + CB)\n   - Cc (from CB + cb)\n   - cc (from cb + cb)\n   - bb (from cb + cb)\n\n   Now, applying the dominance rules:\n\n   For Pigmentation (C):\n   - C_: Red\n   - cc: Plain\n\n   For Color (B):\n   - B_: Brown\n   - bb: Checkered\n\n   So for each F2 genotype, the phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\n   Let's go through each possibility:\n\n1. CC (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. If B is present (i.e., any B allele), Brown; else, checkered. In CC, there are no b alleles, so color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n2. Cc (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In Cc, there are no b alleles, so color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n3. cc (Plain) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: depends on B. If B is present, Brown; else, checkered. In cc, there are no b alleles, so color is checkered. So phenotype: Plain Checkered.\n\n4. bb (Checkered) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: depends on B. In bb, there are no B alleles, so color is checkered. So phenotype: Checkered Checkered.\n\nWait, but this seems off because some phenotypes might combine differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the F2 as a grid showing all possible F2 genotypes and then assign the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nAnother approach: Use a Punnett square for F2 where each parent is CcBb. The F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. So the F2 population will consist of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each:\n\n1. CC (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In CC, no b alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n2. Cc (Red) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In Cc, no b alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n3. cc (Plain) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: depends on B. In cc, no B alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Plain Checkered.\n\n4. bb (Checkered) x anything:\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: depends on B. In bb, no B alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Checkered Checkered.\n\nWait, that suggests that all F2 individuals have the phenotype of either Red Checkered or Plain Checkered, which isn't matching typical dihybrid crosses. That must mean I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAh, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy:\n\nFor Pigmentation (C):\n\n- C_: Red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor Color (B):\n\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the F2 generation includes all combinations of the two traits, so the correct way is to create a Punnett square for F2, considering both genes simultaneously. \n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the F2 Punnett square properly. Let's assume the F1 is CcBb, and selfing to get F2. The possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb (since F1 is heterozygous for both genes). Therefore, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In CC, no b alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n2. Cc (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: depends on B. In Cc, no b alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Red Checkered.\n\n3. cc (Plain):\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: depends on B. In cc, no B alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Plain Checkered.\n\n4. bb (Checkered):\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: depends on B. In bb, no B alleles \u2192 color is checkered. So phenotype: Checkered Checkered.\n\nWait, this still leads to all F2 individuals having either Red Checkered or Plain Checkered, which seems unlikely. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes combine.

But in reality, each trait is expressed independently, so the phenotype is a combination of both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the error lies in assuming that all F2 individuals inherit the same gametes. Let me reconsider the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes correctly.\n\nThe F2 generation consists of the following possible genotypes and their respective phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n2. Cc (Red):\n   - Pigmentation: Red\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n3. cc (Plain):\n   - Pigmentation: Plain\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\n4. bb (Checkered):\n   - Pigmentation: Checkered\n   - Color: Checkered (no B alleles)\n   - Phenotype: Checkered Checkered\n\nWait, this brings us back to the previous conclusion. It appears that all F2 individuals have either Red Checkered or Plain Checkered, which doesn't align with typical dihybrid outcomes. This suggests that my understanding of the dominance hierarchy might be incomplete or incorrectly applied.\n\nUpon reflection, perhaps the issue is that in the dihybrid cross, each trait is evaluated independently, but when both are expressed, the phenotype combines both. However, in this case, since all F2 individuals inherit either all dominant alleles or none, leading to the observed phenotypes. This might be due to the specific dominance hierarchy presented in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the color and pigment are expressed together, and thus, the F2 phenotypes would reflect both traits. But according to the given dominance hierarchy, each trait is expressed independently.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the F2 Punnett square. Let me try constructing it again more carefully.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce gametes CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 will have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC (red), B_\n- From CB + cb: Cc (red), B_\n- From cb + cb: cc (plain), B_\n- From cb + CB: Cc (red), bb\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more precise to build a Punnett square where each parent's gametes are represented. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. Therefore, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + CB)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the F1 is CcBb, so it's not a simple dihybrid cross. Let me clarify: The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. Therefore, the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- 25% CB (from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, taking CB from each parent)\n- 25% cb (from CB and cb)\n- 25% cB (from cb and CB)\n- 2",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the actual phenotypic ratios might differ slightly due to dominance and codominance.",
    "rollout": " Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the actual phenotypic ratios might differ slightly due to dominance and codominance. However, in this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 would follow a simple Mendelian pattern. So, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Checkered red (C_B_) \u2013 requires at least one dominant allele for C and B.\n- Phenotype 2: Checkered brown (c_b_) \u2013 at least one dominant c and B.\n- Phenotype 3: Plain red (C_bb) \u2013 at least one dominant C but recessive B.\n- Phenotype 4: Plain brown (ccBB) \u2013 at least one recessive c and B.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles. For example, if a bird is CcBb, it could be either Checkered Brown (if both c and B are present) or Checkered Red (if B is present regardless of c). Similarly, if it's ccBB, it's Plain Brown. If it's CC bb, it's Plain Red. And if it's Cc bb, it's Checkered Red. Hmm, but I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. Gene C: C (dominant) or c (recessive). Gene B: B (dominant) or b (recessive).\n\nThe phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for C (i.e., C or cc), then it's either Checkered or Plain.\n- Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for B (i.e., B or bb), then it's either Brown or Plain.\n\nSo, the presence of any dominant allele in each gene results in the respective phenotype.\n\nNow, looking at the F2 generation from the cross of CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes CB or cb gametes. Then, the F2 would consist of four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n2. Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n3. cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n4. bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC and Cc: Both have at least one dominant C, so they are Checkered.\n- cC and cc: At least one recessive c, so they are Plain.\n- BB and Bb: At least one dominant B, so they are Brown.\n- bB and bb: At least one recessive b, so they are Plain.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 would not have any heterozygotes unless there's some sort of crossing over or recombination. But in this case, the parents are homozygous, so the F2 would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio without any recombinant gametes. But wait, that's only true if the genes assort independently, which may not always be the case. However, given the parents are homozygous, the F2 should indeed be a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% Checkered Red (assuming B is present)\n- 25% Checkered Brown (assuming B is present)\n- 25% Plain Red (assuming b is present)\n- 25% Plain Brown (assuming b is present)\n\nBut wait, the presence of B doesn't necessarily make them brown; rather, it's the combination of alleles that determines the phenotype. So, any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, regardless of the C allele. Similarly, any bird with at least one b allele will be plain.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant C (i.e., C_) and at least one dominant B (i.e., B_) will be Checkered Brown (B_ and C_)\n- Any bird with at least one dominant C and at least one recessive b (i.e., cc) will be Checkered Red (c_ and C_)\n- Any bird with at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B will be Plain Brown (B_ and cc)\n- Any bird with at least one recessive c and at least one recessive b will be Plain Red (c_ and bb)\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Because for a bird to be Checkered Brown, it must have at least one dominant allele for C (so C_) and at least one dominant allele for B (so B_), making it C_B_. Similarly, Checkered Red would require at least one recessive c (c_) and at least one dominant B (B_), so c_B_. Plain Brown would require at least one recessive c (cc) and at least one dominant B (B_), so B_cc. Plain Red would require at least one recessive c and recessive b, so cbb.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio among these four phenotypes. So, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. But looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16? Doesn't add up.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 16 total, but this seems odd because it suggests no plain red.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16 total, but how?\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total, but why would checkered red be low?\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total.\nF. All 16 equally \u2192 4 each.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16, but no plain brown.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 16.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16.\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 12 total.\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16, each 4.\n\nWait, but according to my previous reasoning, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, which is 4 each in a 16 bird population. So option K says each occurs 4 times. But looking back, the options don't include K. Wait, the options provided are A through J, but K isn't listed. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 generation includes more than just the four phenotypes, such as recombinant phenotypes or something else. But given the parents are homozygous, recombinants shouldn't occur. Alternatively, maybe the F1 generation wasn't considered correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is formed by selfing, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the phenotypes, ignoring dominance for simplicity. But in reality, dominance matters. Let me consider dominance:\n\n- For pigment color (gene C):\n  - Dominant C (C_) \u2192 red\n  - Recessive c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (gene B):\n  - Dominant B (B_) \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive b (bb) \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the phenotypes depend on both alleles. So, a bird will be:\n\n- Checkered Red (C_B_): Requires at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B.\n- Checkered Brown (c_B_): Requires at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B.\n- Plain Red (c_bb): Requires at least one recessive c and at least one recessive b.\n- Plain Brown (B_bb): Requires at least one dominant B and at least one recessive b.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- 25% C_B_: Checkered Red\n- 25% c_B_: Checkered Brown\n- 25% c_bb: Plain Red\n- 25% B_bb: Plain Brown\n\nThus, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time. But looking at the options, none seem to reflect this exactly. Wait, perhaps the options assume that the F2 generation includes only the dominant phenotypes, ignoring the recessive ones. That would mean:\n\n- Checkered Red (25%) + Checkered Brown (25%) = 50%\n- Plain Red (25%) + Plain Brown (25%) = 50%\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation, including all four. In that case, each phenotype would occur 25%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options list 1:1:1:1. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A through J, but the user hasn't provided the complete options. Assuming the options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 16 total\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 16 total\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 16 total\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 16 total\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 16 total\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 16 total\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 16 total\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 16 total\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 16 total\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 12 total\n\nGiven that, the correct answer where each phenotype occurs 25% is missing, but perhaps the intended answer considers only dominant phenotypes, leading to Checkered Red and Checkered Brown (50%) and Plain Red and Plain Brown (50%). However, the options do not reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and the intended answer was Option G, which states 12, 2, 2, 0, implying that only Checkered Red and Checkered Brown (14) plus Plain Red (2) and Plain Brown (0)? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user included a wrong option.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the F2 generation refers to the number of birds with certain phenotypes, considering only the dominant traits. But that would lead to Checkered Red (all C_B_), Checkered Brown (all c_B_), Plain Red (all c_bb), and Plain Brown (all B_bb). But again, none of the options reflect 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 generation instead of F2, but they mistakenly wrote F2. Given that, the F1 phenotypes would be 25% Checkered Red (C_B_), 25% Checkered Brown (c_B_), 25% Plain Red (c_bb), and 25% Plain Brown (B_bb), totaling 100%.\n\nIf the question is about the F1 generation, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, i.e., 25% each. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation with all four phenotypes occurring. In that case, each phenotype would appear 25% of the time, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but again, no option reflects this. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAssuming the correct answer is that each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the closest is Option K, which isn't available. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Option D, which states 1, 3, 9, 3, implying a different ratio, but that doesn't align with the dominance rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied dominance. Let me clarify:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C_ \u2192 red\n  - cc \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - B_ \u2192 brown\n  - bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo, a bird will have:\n\n- Checkered Red if it has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B (C_B_).\n- Checkered Brown if it has at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B (c_B_).\n- Plain Red if it has at least one recessive c and at least one recessive b (c_bb).\n- Plain Brown if it has at least one dominant B and at least one recessive b (B_bb).\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of these four phenotypes occurs 25% of the time, so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps the correct answer is Option J, which states 2, 6, 3, 1, but that adds up to 12, which doesn't account for all four phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different method, like considering only dominant alleles without accounting for co-dominance, but that complicates things further.\n\nAnother approach: If we ignore dominance and count all combinations, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, leading to 225 birds total. Then, the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/225 = 4\n- Checkered Brown: 3/225 = 1\n- Plain Red: 3/225 = 1\n- Plain Brown: 1/225 = 0.444...\n\nBut this still doesn't fit any of the given options except Option J, which sums to 12, but that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation, not F2. If that's the case, the F1 phenotypes would be 25% Checkered Red and 25% Checkered Brown, leading to a 1:1 ratio. But none of the options reflect this either.\n\nGiven the confusion and the lack of matching options, perhaps the intended answer is Option H, which is 5, 3, 2, 6, but that doesn't align with the dominance rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest plausible is Option G, which says 12, 2, 2, 0, but that implies that only Checkered Red and Checkered Brown exist, which isn't accurate because both are phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" This totals 16 birds, with 6 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Brown, 6 Plain Red, and 2 Plain Brown. But according to our earlier analysis, each phenotype should be 4 in a 16 bird population. So this doesn't align. Maybe the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, where the phenotypes are 25% Checkered Red and 25% Checkered Brown, leading to a 1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects the dominant phenotypes, which would be 50% Checkered and 50% Plain, giving a 1:1 ratio. Among the options, Option H states a 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which fits perfectly, indicating that all four phenotypes are equally likely, which contradicts the dominance rules.\n\nWait, Option F says 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs 25%. But the dominance rules dictate that only Checkered Red and Checkered Brown (Checkered Red: 50%) and Plain Red and Plain Brown (Plain Red: 50%), totaling 100%, so the distribution should be 50% Checkered and 50% Plain. Hence, the correct ratio should be 1:1, not 4:4:4:4. So Option F is incorrect.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but based on the options, Option G is 12,2,2,0, which seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write a different option, but I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is not among the provided options, but since I have to choose, perhaps Option H, despite being incorrect, is the closest.\n\nWait, another thought: If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be CcBb x CcBb. Using a Punnett square, the possible F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (50%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (C_B_)\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown (c_B_ since B is present)\n- CC bb: Plain Red (c_bb)\n- Cc BB: Checkered Brown (since C is present)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb: Checkered Red (since B is recessive, but C is present)\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown (since B is present)\n- cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nWait, this is confusing.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. Alternatively, considering independent assortment, the actual phenotypic ratios might differ slightly due to dominance and codominance. However, in this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 would follow a simple Mendelian pattern. So, in terms of phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Checkered red (C_B_) \u2013 requires at least one dominant allele for C and B.\n- Phenotype 2: Checkered brown (c_b_) \u2013 at least one dominant c and B.\n- Phenotype 3: Plain red (C_bb) \u2013 at least one dominant C but recessive B.\n- Phenotype 4: Plain brown (ccBB) \u2013 at least one recessive c and B.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotypes depend on the combination of alleles. For example, if a bird is CcBb, it could be either Checkered Brown (if both c and B are present) or Checkered Red (if B is present regardless of c). Similarly, if it's ccBB, it's Plain Brown. If it's CC bb, it's Plain Red. And if it's Cc bb, it's Checkered Red. Hmm, but I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this systematically.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. Gene C: C (dominant) or c (recessive). Gene B: B (dominant) or b (recessive).\n\nThe phenotype depends on whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for C (i.e., C or cc), then it's either Checkered or Plain.\n- Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for B (i.e., B or bb), then it's either Brown or Plain.\n\nSo, the presence of any dominant allele in each gene results in the respective phenotype.\n\nNow, looking at the F2 generation from the cross of CC BB \u00d7 cc bb, the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes CB or cb gametes. Then, the F2 would consist of four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n2. Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n3. cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n4. bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC and Cc: Both have at least one dominant C, so they are Checkered.\n- cC and cc: At least one recessive c, so they are Plain.\n- BB and Bb: At least one dominant B, so they are Brown.\n- bB and bb: At least one recessive b, so they are Plain.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 would not have any heterozygotes unless there's some sort of crossing over or recombination. But in this case, the parents are homozygous, so the F2 would follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio without any recombinant gametes. But wait, that's only true if the genes assort independently, which may not always be the case. However, given the parents are homozygous, the F2 should indeed be a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% Checkered Red (assuming B is present)\n- 25% Checkered Brown (assuming B is present)\n- 25% Plain Red (assuming b is present)\n- 25% Plain Brown (assuming b is present)\n\nBut wait, the presence of B doesn't necessarily make them brown; rather, it's the combination of alleles that determines the phenotype. So, any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, regardless of the C allele. Similarly, any bird with at least one b allele will be plain.\n\nSo, in the F2 generation:\n\n- Any bird with at least one dominant C (i.e., C_) and at least one dominant B (i.e., B_) will be Checkered Brown (B_ and C_)\n- Any bird with at least one dominant C and at least one recessive b (i.e., cc) will be Checkered Red (c_ and C_)\n- Any bird with at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B will be Plain Brown (B_ and cc)\n- Any bird with at least one recessive c and at least one recessive b will be Plain Red (c_ and bb)\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Because for a bird to be Checkered Brown, it must have at least one dominant allele for C (so C_) and at least one dominant allele for B (so B_), making it C_B_. Similarly, Checkered Red would require at least one recessive c (c_) and at least one dominant B (B_), so c_B_. Plain Brown would require at least one recessive c (cc) and at least one dominant B (B_), so B_cc. Plain Red would require at least one recessive c and recessive b, so cbb.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since the parents are homozygous, the F2 would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio among these four phenotypes. So, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. But looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16? Doesn't add up.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 16 total, but this seems odd because it suggests no plain red.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16 total, but how?\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total, but why would checkered red be low?\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16 total.\nF. All 16 equally \u2192 4 each.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16, but no plain brown.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 16.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16.\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 12 total.\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16, each 4.\n\nWait, but according to my previous reasoning, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, which is 4 each in a 16 bird population. So option K says each occurs 4 times. But looking back, the options don't include K. Wait, the options provided are A through J, but K isn't listed. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 generation includes more than just the four phenotypes, such as recombinant phenotypes or something else. But given the parents are homozygous, recombinants shouldn't occur. Alternatively, maybe the F1 generation wasn't considered correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is formed by selfing, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the phenotypes, ignoring dominance for simplicity. But in reality, dominance matters. Let me consider dominance:\n\n- For pigment color (gene C):\n  - Dominant C (C_) \u2192 red\n  - Recessive c (cc) \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (gene B):\n  - Dominant B (B_) \u2192 brown\n  - Recessive b (bb) \u2192 plain\n\nThus, the phenotypes depend on both alleles. So, a bird will be:\n\n- Checkered Red (C_B_): Requires at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B.\n- Checkered Brown (c_B_): Requires at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B.\n- Plain Red (c_bb): Requires at least one recessive c and at least one recessive b.\n- Plain Brown (B_bb): Requires at least one dominant B and at least one recessive b.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- 25% C_B_: Checkered Red\n- 25% c_B_: Checkered Brown\n- 25% c_bb: Plain Red\n- 25% B_bb: Plain Brown\n\nThus, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time. But looking at the options, none seem to reflect this exactly. Wait, perhaps the options assume that the F2 generation includes only the dominant phenotypes, ignoring the recessive ones. That would mean:\n\n- Checkered Red (25%) + Checkered Brown (25%) = 50%\n- Plain Red (25%) + Plain Brown (25%) = 50%\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation, including all four. In that case, each phenotype would occur 25%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options list 1:1:1:1. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A through J, but the user hasn't provided the complete options. Assuming the options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 16 total\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 16 total\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 16 total\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 16 total\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 16 total\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 16 total\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 16 total\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 16 total\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 16 total\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 12 total\n\nGiven that, the correct answer where each phenotype occurs 25% is missing, but perhaps the intended answer considers only dominant phenotypes, leading to Checkered Red and Checkered Brown (50%) and Plain Red and Plain Brown (50%). However, the options do not reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and the intended answer was Option G, which states 12, 2, 2, 0, implying that only Checkered Red and Checkered Brown (14) plus Plain Red (2) and Plain Brown (0)? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user included a wrong option.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the F2 generation refers to the number of birds with certain phenotypes, considering only the dominant traits. But that would lead to Checkered Red (all C_B_), Checkered Brown (all c_B_), Plain Red (all c_bb), and Plain Brown (all B_bb). But again, none of the options reflect 1:1:1:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the F1 generation instead of F2, but they mistakenly wrote F2. Given that, the F1 phenotypes would be 25% Checkered Red (C_B_), 25% Checkered Brown (c_B_), 25% Plain Red (c_bb), and 25% Plain Brown (B_bb), totaling 100%.\n\nIf the question is about the F1 generation, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, i.e., 25% each. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation with all four phenotypes occurring. In that case, each phenotype would appear 25% of the time, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but again, no option reflects this. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAssuming the correct answer is that each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the closest is Option K, which isn't available. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Option D, which states 1, 3, 9, 3, implying a different ratio, but that doesn't align with the dominance rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied dominance. Let me clarify:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C_ \u2192 red\n  - cc \u2192 plain\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - B_ \u2192 brown\n  - bb \u2192 plain\n\nSo, a bird will have:\n\n- Checkered Red if it has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B (C_B_).\n- Checkered Brown if it has at least one recessive c and at least one dominant B (c_B_).\n- Plain Red if it has at least one recessive c and at least one recessive b (c_bb).\n- Plain Brown if it has at least one dominant B and at least one recessive b (B_bb).\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of these four phenotypes occurs 25% of the time, so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps the correct answer is Option J, which states 2, 6, 3, 1, but that adds up to 12, which doesn't account for all four phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different method, like considering only dominant alleles without accounting for co-dominance, but that complicates things further.\n\nAnother approach: If we ignore dominance and count all combinations, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, leading to 225 birds total. Then, the phenotypic counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Red: 9/225 = 4\n- Checkered Brown: 3/225 = 1\n- Plain Red: 3/225 = 1\n- Plain Brown: 1/225 = 0.444...\n\nBut this still doesn't fit any of the given options except Option J, which sums to 12, but that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation, not F2. If that's the case, the F1 phenotypes would be 25% Checkered Red and 25% Checkered Brown, leading to a 1:1 ratio. But none of the options reflect this either.\n\nGiven the confusion and the lack of matching options, perhaps the intended answer is Option H, which is 5, 3, 2, 6, but that doesn't align with the dominance rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but given the options, the closest plausible is Option G, which says 12, 2, 2, 0, but that implies that only Checkered Red and Checkered Brown exist, which isn't accurate because both are phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" This totals 16 birds, with 6 Checkered Red, 2 Checkered Brown, 6 Plain Red, and 2 Plain Brown. But according to our earlier analysis, each phenotype should be 4 in a 16 bird population. So this doesn't align. Maybe the user made a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the F1 generation, where the phenotypes are 25% Checkered Red and 25% Checkered Brown, leading to a 1:1 ratio. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that reflects the dominant phenotypes, which would be 50% Checkered and 50% Plain, giving a 1:1 ratio. Among the options, Option H states a 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which also doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which fits perfectly, indicating that all four phenotypes are equally likely, which contradicts the dominance rules.\n\nWait, Option F says 4,4,4,4, which is 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs 25%. But the dominance rules dictate that only Checkered Red and Checkered Brown (Checkered Red: 50%) and Plain Red and Plain Brown (Plain Red: 50%), totaling 100%, so the distribution should be 50% Checkered and 50% Plain. Hence, the correct ratio should be 1:1, not 4:4:4:4. So Option F is incorrect.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but based on the options, Option G is 12,2,2,0, which seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write a different option, but I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is not among the provided options, but since I have to choose, perhaps Option H, despite being incorrect, is the closest.\n\nWait, another thought: If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be CcBb x CcBb. Using a Punnett square, the possible F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (50%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nBut considering dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered Red (C_B_)\n- CC Bb: Checkered Brown (c_B_ since B is present)\n- CC bb: Plain Red (c_bb)\n- Cc BB: Checkered Brown (since C is present)\n- Cc Bb: Checkered Brown\n- Cc bb: Checkered Red (since B is recessive, but C is present)\n- cc BB: Plain Red\n- cc Bb: Plain Brown (since B is present)\n- cc bb: Plain Brown\n\nWait, this is confusing.

    "chunk_removed": "However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, if considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently.",
    "rollout": " However, if considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently. So the actual F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since we're dealing with specific alleles, let's consider them separately.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the inheritance for each gene separately and then combine the results. Because the question involves two genes, C and B, and each is linked or independent. But since it's not specified, I'll assume independent assortment. So for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: C (dominant, red) vs c (recessive, plain)\n- Gene B: B (dominant, brown) vs b (recessive, checkered)\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. Parent 1 (CC BB): Always gives C and B.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Always gives c and b.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) will always express the dominant phenotype for both genes. Now, when F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself, the F2 will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC (homozygous dominant)\n- 50% Cc (heterozygous)\n- 25% cc (homozygous recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n- 25% BB (homozygous dominant)\n- 50% Bb (heterozygous)\n- 25% bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nSince the genes are assumed to assort independently, the combination of these probabilities leads to the F2 phenotypic ratios. But how does this translate into phenotypic ratios?\n\nEach gene's expression depends on its dominant allele. So for each gene:\n\n- C determines pigment color: C (red) > c (plain)\n- B determines color: B (brown) > b (checkered)\n\nNow, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let's list all possible genotypic combinations and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this seems too broad. Instead, let's consider the dominant phenotypes for each gene and their combinations. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the number of individuals for each possible phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to look up the typical F2 ratios when two genes are present, assuming independent assortment. Normally, without any dominance, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, with dominance, some categories may merge.\n\nGiven that both genes are under dominant conditions, the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- All individuals with at least one dominant allele for both genes will have a certain phenotype.\nBut perhaps it's simpler to use the principle that each gene's effect is additive. Let's calculate the number of individuals with each phenotype.\n\nTotal F2 population after crossing:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor gene B:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the total possible genotypes are 16 (since 4x4=16).\n\nLet's categorize each into their respective phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_):\n   - C (C_B_) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n   - Wait, no. This isn't correct. Actually, for each gene, the proportion is multiplied, and then combined.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for independent assortment:\n\nThe probability of having a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nSo, for example, to get Checkered Brown:\n\n- Must have at least one c (for C_ ) and at least one b (for B_ )\nSo the probability is (prob of C_ ) * (prob of B_ ) = (0.75) * (0.75) = 0.5625, or 56.25%\n\nCheckered Brown: 56.25%\n\nPlain Brown (non-checkered, B_ ):\n\nWait, no. Checkered is when both are recessive (cc and bb). Wait, actually, the terminology might confuse me. Let me clarify:\n\nIn standard terms:\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 phenotype is \"plain\" checkered?\nWait, no. Wait, the description says:\n\n- C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both alleles. For a bird to be \"checkered,\" both genes must be recessive: cc and bb. So, the phenotype would be \"plain\" checkered.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the checkered bird is when both genes are recessive, but it's also described as \"checkered.\" Hmm, perhaps the wording is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the color pattern, while \"plain\" refers to the absence of pigment. But regardless, the key is that for a bird to be checkered, it must have c for both C and c. Similarly, for brown, it must have B for both.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to treat each gene's contribution separately. Let's proceed methodically.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of individuals for each possible phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Brown**: Both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b). So, phenotype is plain checkered.\n   Probability = (probability of c for C) * (probability of b for B) = (0.25) * (0.25) = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\n2. **Plain Brown**: Only B is recessive (b), but C is dominant (C).\n   Probability = (probability of C for C) * (probability of b for B) = (0.75) * (0.25) = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n3. **Checkered Plain**: Only C is recessive (c), but B is dominant (B).\n   Probability = (probability of c for C) * (probability of B for B) = (0.25) * (0.75) = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n4. **Plain Checkered**: Neither C nor B is dominant; both are recessive.\n   Probability = (probability of c for C) * (probability of b for B) = (0.25) * (0.25) = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nWait, but this sums to 6.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 49.99%, which is approximately 50%. That leaves 50% unaccounted for. What could be causing this discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps the assumption that both genes are acting independently and each has a 50% chance of being recessive is flawed. In reality, each gene's probability of being expressed is calculated differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to account for the fact that some phenotypes overlap. For instance, if a bird has both C_ and B_, it could be either brown or checkered depending on which allele is missing. Wait, no. If both alleles are present, the bird will display the dominant trait for each gene. So, if both C and B are dominant, it will be brown and checkered. Wait, no\u2014it's a bit more nuanced. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. If for gene C, it has at least one dominant allele (C_), it expresses the dominant color (red). If it's recessive (cc), it expresses the recessive color (plain). Similarly for gene B.\n\nTherefore, a bird will be brown if it has at least one dominant allele for B (B_), and checkered if it has at least one dominant allele for C (C_). The only way a bird can be both brown and checkered is if it has at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Both Dominant**: C_ and B_ \u2192 Brown and Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. **Dominant for B, Recessive for C**: C_ and cc \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. **Recessive for B, Dominant for C**: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n4. **Both Recessive**: cc and cc \u2192 Plain and Plain \u2192 Plain Checkered? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014if both are recessive, it's plain. But in terms of checkered, perhaps it's just plain. Hmm, confusion arises.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant (C_ and B_), the bird is brown and checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C is dominant (C_) but B is recessive (bb), the bird is brown and plain \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- If C is recessive (cc) but B is dominant (B_), the bird is plain and checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n- If both C and B are recessive (cc and bb), the bird is plain and plain \u2192 Plain Checkered? Or is it just plain?\n\nWait, no, if both are recessive, then the bird is plain (no pigment) and checkered (as per the definition of the bird's color). Wait, but the definitions say:\n\n- Checkered is when both alleles are recessive (cc and bb)\n- Plain is when neither allele is dominant (cc and bb, but perhaps that's not accurate. Wait, no. Checkered is defined as both alleles are recessive (cc and bb), while plain is when both alleles are dominant (BB and BB?) Wait, no, checkered is when both are recessive, and plain is when both are dominant.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nDefinitions:\n- C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo:\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (cc and bb)\n- Plain: both alleles are dominant (BB and BB?) Wait, no. Wait, checkered is when both are recessive, so the phenotype is checkered. Plain would be when neither is dominant, i.e., both are recessive, but that's conflicting with the definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion in the definitions. Let me try again:\n\n- **Checkered Bird**: Both alleles are recessive (cc and bb). So, the phenotype is \"plain\" checkered.\n- **Plain Bird**: Both alleles are dominant (BB and BB?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps checkered is when both are recessive (cc and bb), and plain is when both are dominant (BB and BB). Wait, that still doesn't make sense because BB is dominant, not plain.\n\nWait, perhaps the definitions are inverted. Let me reread the problem statement:\n\n- **Red**: C is dominant (so red is expressed if at least one C allele)\n- **Plain**: c is recessive (so plain is expressed if both alleles are c)\n- **Brown**: B is dominant (so brown is expressed if at least one B allele)\n- **Checkered**: b is recessive (so checkered is expressed if both alleles are b)\n\nTherefore:\n- Checkered: both alleles are b (bb and bb)\n- Plain: both alleles are c (cc and cc)\n- Brown: at least one B allele (BB, Bb, Bb, etc.)\n- Red: at least one C allele (CC, CB, CB, etc.)\n\nWith that clarified, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: Both alleles are recessive (bb and B?), but wait, no. To be checkered, both must be recessive. Wait, no, the checkered bird is when both are recessive (bb and bb?), but that's not quite right. Wait, the checkered bird is when both alleles are recessive, i.e., both are b. So the phenotype is \"plain\" checkered.\n\nWait, no, the definitions are:\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (bb and bb), resulting in a \"plain\" checkered phenotype.\n- Plain: both alleles are dominant (CC and CC?), but that can't be right because CC is dominant over Cc and cc. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure this properly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene determines the phenotype:\n\n- Gene C:\n  - C (dominant, red) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive, plain) \u2192 Plain\n- Gene B:\n  - B (dominant, brown) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive, checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. A bird is:\n\n- **Checkered**: Both alleles are recessive (both genes are b) \u2192 Checkered phenotype\n- **Plain**: At least one allele is dominant (either C, B, or both) \u2192 Plain phenotype\n- **Brown**: At least one allele is dominant for B \u2192 Brown phenotype\n- **Red**: At least one allele is dominant for C \u2192 Red phenotype\n\nAdditionally, note that a bird cannot be both brown and checkered unless both genes are dominant, but that's impossible because if both genes are dominant, it's red. So the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F2 generation:\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following possible genotypic combinations for each gene, based on independent assortment:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor gene B:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nWhen considering both genes together, we'll multiply the probabilities for each combination. However, instead of calculating each possibility individually, we can use the principle of multiplication for independent genes.\n\nHowever, since we're interested in phenotypic ratios, let's determine the proportion of each phenotype based on the genotypes.\n\nPhenotype | Genotype(s) Leading to It | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\n**Checkered Brown** | bb and B? No. Wait, no. Checkered is when both are recessive. So, bb (gene B) and cc (gene C). So, the genotype is cc bb. So, frequency is (25% for cc) * (25% for bb) = 6.25%.\n\n**Checkered Plain** | bb and cc? Wait, no. Checkered is when both are recessive. So, the phenotype is plain checkered, which is when both alleles are recessive. So, the genotype is cc (for C) and bb (for B). So, the phenotype is plain checkered, regardless of B. But wait, in our case, if both are recessive, the phenotype is plain checkered.\n\nWait, but according to the definitions, checkered is when both are recessive, so the phenotype is \"plain\" checkered. Therefore, the phenotype is the same as the checkered condition, so all cc (regardless of B) will be plain checkered. Wait, but that contradicts the previous understanding. Maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on whether each gene exhibits its dominant trait. Let's redefine the phenotypes based on each gene's presence:\n\n- **Checkered**: Both alleles are recessive (cc and bb). So, phenotype is plain checkered.\n- **Plain**: At least one allele is dominant (CC, Cc, Cc, or cc). Wait, no, plain is when neither gene shows dominance. Wait, no. Wait, plain is when both genes are recessive (cc and cc), which would make the bird plain checkered, not plain. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that a bird is:\n\n- **Checkered**: both alleles are recessive \u2192 phenotype is plain checkered\n- **Plain**: at least one allele is dominant \u2192 phenotype is plain\n- **Brown**: at least one allele is dominant for B \u2192 phenotype is brown\n- **Red**: at least one allele is dominant for C \u2192 phenotype is red\n\nWait, but according to the definitions, checkered is when both are recessive, so the phenotype is \"plain\" checkered. So, the bird is \"plain\" checkered if both alleles are recessive. Otherwise, it's \"plain\" (if at least one allele is dominant) or \"brown\" (if B is dominant) or \"red\" (if C is dominant).\n\nWait, but if both are recessive, it's plain checkered, not plain. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Checkered**: both alleles recessive \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\n2. **Checkered Brown**: only B is dominant \u2192 phenotype: brown checkered\n3. **Checkered Plain**: only C is dominant \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should structure it differently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- **Checkered**: both alleles are recessive \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\n- **Checkered Brown**: only B is dominant \u2192 phenotype: brown checkered\n- **Checkered Plain**: only C is dominant \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\nWait, that's redundant. Perhaps better to define each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- **Checkered**: both alleles are recessive \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\n- **Checkered Brown**: only B is dominant \u2192 phenotype: brown checkered\n- **Checkered Plain**: only C is dominant \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\nWait, but this counts checkered twice. Maybe I'm making a mistake in defining the phenotypes.\n\nLet me approach it systematically:\n\n1. **Both genes are recessive (cc and bb)**: phenotype is plain checkered\n2. **Only B is dominant (B_ and bb)**: phenotype is brown checkered\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, if considering independent assortment, each gene segregates independently. So the actual F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since we're dealing with specific alleles, let's consider them separately.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the inheritance for each gene separately and then combine the results. Because the question involves two genes, C and B, and each is linked or independent. But since it's not specified, I'll assume independent assortment. So for each gene:\n\n- Gene C: C (dominant, red) vs c (recessive, plain)\n- Gene B: B (dominant, brown) vs b (recessive, checkered)\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. Parent 1 (CC BB): Always gives C and B.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Always gives c and b.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) will always express the dominant phenotype for both genes. Now, when F1 (CcBb) crosses with itself, the F2 will have the following genotypic distribution:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC (homozygous dominant)\n- 50% Cc (heterozygous)\n- 25% cc (homozygous recessive)\n\nSimilarly, for gene B:\n- 25% BB (homozygous dominant)\n- 50% Bb (heterozygous)\n- 25% bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nSince the genes are assumed to assort independently, the combination of these probabilities leads to the F2 phenotypic ratios. But how does this translate into phenotypic ratios?\n\nEach gene's expression depends on its dominant allele. So for each gene:\n\n- C determines pigment color: C (red) > c (plain)\n- B determines color: B (brown) > b (checkered)\n\nNow, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Let's list all possible genotypic combinations and their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Plain\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C (red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 Checkered Plain\n7. cc BB \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but this seems too broad. Instead, let's consider the dominant phenotypes for each gene and their combinations. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the number of individuals for each possible phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to look up the typical F2 ratios when two genes are present, assuming independent assortment. Normally, without any dominance, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, with dominance, some categories may merge.\n\nGiven that both genes are under dominant conditions, the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- All individuals with at least one dominant allele for both genes will have a certain phenotype.\nBut perhaps it's simpler to use the principle that each gene's effect is additive. Let's calculate the number of individuals with each phenotype.\n\nTotal F2 population after crossing:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor gene B:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the total possible genotypes are 16 (since 4x4=16).\n\nLet's categorize each into their respective phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (C_B_):\n   - C (C_B_) = 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n   - Wait, no. This isn't correct. Actually, for each gene, the proportion is multiplied, and then combined.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for independent assortment:\n\nThe probability of having a particular phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed.\n\nSo, for example, to get Checkered Brown:\n\n- Must have at least one c (for C_ ) and at least one b (for B_ )\nSo the probability is (prob of C_ ) * (prob of B_ ) = (0.75) * (0.75) = 0.5625, or 56.25%\n\nCheckered Brown: 56.25%\n\nPlain Brown (non-checkered, B_ ):\n\nWait, no. Checkered is when both are recessive (cc and bb). Wait, actually, the terminology might confuse me. Let me clarify:\n\nIn standard terms:\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (cc and bb) \u2192 phenotype is \"plain\" checkered?\nWait, no. Wait, the description says:\n\n- C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, the phenotype depends on both alleles. For a bird to be \"checkered,\" both genes must be recessive: cc and bb. So, the phenotype would be \"plain\" checkered.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the checkered bird is when both genes are recessive, but it's also described as \"checkered.\" Hmm, perhaps the wording is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the color pattern, while \"plain\" refers to the absence of pigment. But regardless, the key is that for a bird to be checkered, it must have c for both C and c. Similarly, for brown, it must have B for both.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to treat each gene's contribution separately. Let's proceed methodically.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of individuals for each possible phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered Brown**: Both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b). So, phenotype is plain checkered.\n   Probability = (probability of c for C) * (probability of b for B) = (0.25) * (0.25) = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\n2. **Plain Brown**: Only B is recessive (b), but C is dominant (C).\n   Probability = (probability of C for C) * (probability of b for B) = (0.75) * (0.25) = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n3. **Checkered Plain**: Only C is recessive (c), but B is dominant (B).\n   Probability = (probability of c for C) * (probability of B for B) = (0.25) * (0.75) = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\n4. **Plain Checkered**: Neither C nor B is dominant; both are recessive.\n   Probability = (probability of c for C) * (probability of b for B) = (0.25) * (0.25) = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nWait, but this sums to 6.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 49.99%, which is approximately 50%. That leaves 50% unaccounted for. What could be causing this discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps the assumption that both genes are acting independently and each has a 50% chance of being recessive is flawed. In reality, each gene's probability of being expressed is calculated differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to account for the fact that some phenotypes overlap. For instance, if a bird has both C_ and B_, it could be either brown or checkered depending on which allele is missing. Wait, no. If both alleles are present, the bird will display the dominant trait for each gene. So, if both C and B are dominant, it will be brown and checkered. Wait, no\u2014it's a bit more nuanced. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. If for gene C, it has at least one dominant allele (C_), it expresses the dominant color (red). If it's recessive (cc), it expresses the recessive color (plain). Similarly for gene B.\n\nTherefore, a bird will be brown if it has at least one dominant allele for B (B_), and checkered if it has at least one dominant allele for C (C_). The only way a bird can be both brown and checkered is if it has at least one dominant allele for both genes.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Both Dominant**: C_ and B_ \u2192 Brown and Checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. **Dominant for B, Recessive for C**: C_ and cc \u2192 Brown and Plain \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. **Recessive for B, Dominant for C**: cc and B_ \u2192 Plain and Checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n4. **Both Recessive**: cc and cc \u2192 Plain and Plain \u2192 Plain Checkered? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014if both are recessive, it's plain. But in terms of checkered, perhaps it's just plain. Hmm, confusion arises.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant (C_ and B_), the bird is brown and checkered \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- If C is dominant (C_) but B is recessive (bb), the bird is brown and plain \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- If C is recessive (cc) but B is dominant (B_), the bird is plain and checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n- If both C and B are recessive (cc and bb), the bird is plain and plain \u2192 Plain Checkered? Or is it just plain?\n\nWait, no, if both are recessive, then the bird is plain (no pigment) and checkered (as per the definition of the bird's color). Wait, but the definitions say:\n\n- Checkered is when both alleles are recessive (cc and bb)\n- Plain is when neither allele is dominant (cc and bb, but perhaps that's not accurate. Wait, no. Checkered is defined as both alleles are recessive (cc and bb), while plain is when both alleles are dominant (BB and BB?) Wait, no, checkered is when both are recessive, and plain is when both are dominant.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nDefinitions:\n- C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo:\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (cc and bb)\n- Plain: both alleles are dominant (BB and BB?) Wait, no. Wait, checkered is when both are recessive, so the phenotype is checkered. Plain would be when neither is dominant, i.e., both are recessive, but that's conflicting with the definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion in the definitions. Let me try again:\n\n- **Checkered Bird**: Both alleles are recessive (cc and bb). So, the phenotype is \"plain\" checkered.\n- **Plain Bird**: Both alleles are dominant (BB and BB?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps checkered is when both are recessive (cc and bb), and plain is when both are dominant (BB and BB). Wait, that still doesn't make sense because BB is dominant, not plain.\n\nWait, perhaps the definitions are inverted. Let me reread the problem statement:\n\n- **Red**: C is dominant (so red is expressed if at least one C allele)\n- **Plain**: c is recessive (so plain is expressed if both alleles are c)\n- **Brown**: B is dominant (so brown is expressed if at least one B allele)\n- **Checkered**: b is recessive (so checkered is expressed if both alleles are b)\n\nTherefore:\n- Checkered: both alleles are b (bb and bb)\n- Plain: both alleles are c (cc and cc)\n- Brown: at least one B allele (BB, Bb, Bb, etc.)\n- Red: at least one C allele (CC, CB, CB, etc.)\n\nWith that clarified, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown: Both alleles are recessive (bb and B?), but wait, no. To be checkered, both must be recessive. Wait, no, the checkered bird is when both are recessive (bb and bb?), but that's not quite right. Wait, the checkered bird is when both alleles are recessive, i.e., both are b. So the phenotype is \"plain\" checkered.\n\nWait, no, the definitions are:\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (bb and bb), resulting in a \"plain\" checkered phenotype.\n- Plain: both alleles are dominant (CC and CC?), but that can't be right because CC is dominant over Cc and cc. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure this properly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene determines the phenotype:\n\n- Gene C:\n  - C (dominant, red) \u2192 Red\n  - c (recessive, plain) \u2192 Plain\n- Gene B:\n  - B (dominant, brown) \u2192 Brown\n  - b (recessive, checkered) \u2192 Checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. A bird is:\n\n- **Checkered**: Both alleles are recessive (both genes are b) \u2192 Checkered phenotype\n- **Plain**: At least one allele is dominant (either C, B, or both) \u2192 Plain phenotype\n- **Brown**: At least one allele is dominant for B \u2192 Brown phenotype\n- **Red**: At least one allele is dominant for C \u2192 Red phenotype\n\nAdditionally, note that a bird cannot be both brown and checkered unless both genes are dominant, but that's impossible because if both genes are dominant, it's red. So the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the F2 generation:\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following possible genotypic combinations for each gene, based on independent assortment:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor gene B:\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nWhen considering both genes together, we'll multiply the probabilities for each combination. However, instead of calculating each possibility individually, we can use the principle of multiplication for independent genes.\n\nHowever, since we're interested in phenotypic ratios, let's determine the proportion of each phenotype based on the genotypes.\n\nPhenotype | Genotype(s) Leading to It | Frequency\n--- | --- | ---\n**Checkered Brown** | bb and B? No. Wait, no. Checkered is when both are recessive. So, bb (gene B) and cc (gene C). So, the genotype is cc bb. So, frequency is (25% for cc) * (25% for bb) = 6.25%.\n\n**Checkered Plain** | bb and cc? Wait, no. Checkered is when both are recessive. So, the phenotype is plain checkered, which is when both alleles are recessive. So, the genotype is cc (for C) and bb (for B). So, the phenotype is plain checkered, regardless of B. But wait, in our case, if both are recessive, the phenotype is plain checkered.\n\nWait, but according to the definitions, checkered is when both are recessive, so the phenotype is \"plain\" checkered. Therefore, the phenotype is the same as the checkered condition, so all cc (regardless of B) will be plain checkered. Wait, but that contradicts the previous understanding. Maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should focus on whether each gene exhibits its dominant trait. Let's redefine the phenotypes based on each gene's presence:\n\n- **Checkered**: Both alleles are recessive (cc and bb). So, phenotype is plain checkered.\n- **Plain**: At least one allele is dominant (CC, Cc, Cc, or cc). Wait, no, plain is when neither gene shows dominance. Wait, no. Wait, plain is when both genes are recessive (cc and cc), which would make the bird plain checkered, not plain. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that a bird is:\n\n- **Checkered**: both alleles are recessive \u2192 phenotype is plain checkered\n- **Plain**: at least one allele is dominant \u2192 phenotype is plain\n- **Brown**: at least one allele is dominant for B \u2192 phenotype is brown\n- **Red**: at least one allele is dominant for C \u2192 phenotype is red\n\nWait, but according to the definitions, checkered is when both are recessive, so the phenotype is \"plain\" checkered. So, the bird is \"plain\" checkered if both alleles are recessive. Otherwise, it's \"plain\" (if at least one allele is dominant) or \"brown\" (if B is dominant) or \"red\" (if C is dominant).\n\nWait, but if both are recessive, it's plain checkered, not plain. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. **Checkered**: both alleles recessive \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\n2. **Checkered Brown**: only B is dominant \u2192 phenotype: brown checkered\n3. **Checkered Plain**: only C is dominant \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should structure it differently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- **Checkered**: both alleles are recessive \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\n- **Checkered Brown**: only B is dominant \u2192 phenotype: brown checkered\n- **Checkered Plain**: only C is dominant \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\nWait, that's redundant. Perhaps better to define each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- **Checkered**: both alleles are recessive \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\n- **Checkered Brown**: only B is dominant \u2192 phenotype: brown checkered\n- **Checkered Plain**: only C is dominant \u2192 phenotype: plain checkered\nWait, but this counts checkered twice. Maybe I'm making a mistake in defining the phenotypes.\n\nLet me approach it systematically:\n\n1. **Both genes are recessive (cc and bb)**: phenotype is plain checkered\n2. **Only B is dominant (B_ and bb)**: phenotype is brown checkered\n",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, considering dominance, some genotypes may be expressed differently.",
    "rollout": " However, considering dominance, some genotypes may be expressed differently. Let me clarify the actual F2 genotypes. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the possible F2 genotypes include:\n\n1. CC: 25%\n2. Cc: 50% (from CB + cb and CB + cb)\nWait, no, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSo the F2 genotype distribution combines these, resulting in nine possible genotypes. Now, for each genotype, we determine the phenotype based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n\n- Pigment (gene C):\n  - C (dominant, red)\n  - c (recessive, plain)\n\n- Color (gene B):\n  - B (dominant, brown)\n  - b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B alleles. We'll use a Punnett square to combine the two loci.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 genotypes and phenotypes are as follows:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment C is dominant (red), Color B is dominant (brown). So overall red-brown.\n2. CC Bb: Same as above, red-brown.\n3. CC bb: Pigment red, but color is checkered (since B is recessive).\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, color brown.\n5. Cc Bb: Red and brown.\n6. Cc bb: Red and checkered.\n7. cc BB: Plain color (since C is recessive), but color is brown.\n8. cc Bb: Plain color, brown.\n9. cc bb: Plain color, checkered.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when both C and B are present, the phenotype is determined by the dominant alleles. So for example, if an individual is Cc and BB, they would express red and brown, making them red-brown. Similarly, Cc Bb would also be red-brown.\n\nBut let's map each combination:\n\n- CC (C): dominates over cc. So all CC individuals have pigment C.\n- bb (b): dominates over BB. So all bb individuals have color b.\n\nThus, the phenotype depends on whether either C or b is present, and similarly for B and b.\n\nWait, no. Because the presence of C affects the pigment, and the presence of B affects the color. So for each individual:\n\nIf C is present (any C allele), then pigment is red (dominant).\n\nIf B is present (any B allele), then color is brown (dominant).\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by the presence of either C or b and B or b.\n\nWait, no, because C and B are separate loci. So:\n\n- If an individual has at least one C (so C is present), then pigment is red, regardless of B.\n- If an individual has at least one B (so B is present), then color is brown, regardless of C.\n- Thus, the phenotype is determined by the presence of either dominant allele in either gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether the individual has at least one dominant allele in pigment (C) or at least one dominant allele in color (B). So any individual with at least one C (regardless of B) shows red pigment, any with at least one B (regardless of C) shows brown color. The combination could be red-brown, red-checkered, blue-brown, or blue-checkered, depending on the alleles.\n\nWait, but in our case, the alleles are C and B. So:\n\n- If C is present (either C or cc), pigment is red.\n- If B is present (either B or bb), color is brown.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by whether pigment or color is present.\n\nNow, let's go back to constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nEach F2 bird inherits two alleles from each parent, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe combined genotypes would be all possible combinations, leading to 9 phenotypic categories, but many will overlap due to dominance.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of each phenotype based on the probabilities.\n\nLet's approach this systematically:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered (both C and b, and B and b)\nWait, no. Actually, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. So checkered would occur when neither C nor B is present. That is, when both alleles are recessive: cc and bb.\n\nWait, no. Because if an individual has even one dominant allele in pigment or color, they will exhibit the corresponding trait. So checkered would only occur if both C and B are recessive (cc bb). Otherwise, they will have at least one dominant allele and thus exhibit red pigment or brown color.\n\nWait, no, because if they have at least one dominant allele in pigment (C) or color (B), they will express the respective trait. So the absence of dominant traits (no C and no B) leads to checkered. That is:\n\n- If C is recessive (cc) AND B is recessive (bb), then both traits are absent: checkered.\n\nOtherwise, if at least one dominant trait is present, the bird will have either red pigment (if C is present) or brown color (if B is present), possibly both.\n\nWait, but since both C and B are independent, the presence of C allows for red pigment, and the presence of B allows for brown color. So, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Red-brown (has C and/or B)\n2. Red-checkered (only has C, no B)\n3. Brown-checkered (only has B, no C)\n4. Checkered (neither C nor B)\n\nSo now, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nTo do this, we can compute the probabilities of having at least one dominant allele in pigment (C) or color (B).\n\nBut since these are independent traits, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in pigment is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in color is 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nHowever, since these are independent events, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in either pigment or color is 1 - (probability of neither). Probability of neither is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. So probability of at least one dominant allele is 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.\n\nWait, but that's the probability of expressing a trait, not necessarily the phenotype. Because having at least one dominant allele doesn't mean the phenotype will be red or brown, but rather that the bird will have red or brown pigment or checkered.\n\nWait, no, because the presence of C allows for red pigment, and presence of B allows for brown color. So the presence of C OR B means the bird will have red or brown pigment or checkered.\n\nBut in reality, since each trait is determined independently, the presence of C ensures red pigment, presence of B ensures brown color. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nLet me try another approach. The total possible genotypes in F2 are:\n\n1. CC BB: All C and all B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb: C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n4. Cc BB: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n6. Cc bb: C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n7. cc BB: c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb: c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb: c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, but according to dominance, any bird with at least one C will have red pigment, and any bird with at least one B will have brown color. So, let's categorize each bird:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb: Both C and B \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb: C but not B \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n4. Cc BB: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n6. Cc bb: C but not B \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n7. cc BB: Not C but B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb: Not C but B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb: Neither C nor B \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- red-brown: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- red-checkered: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n- plain-brown: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- plain-checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 cases, which makes sense since there are 9 possible genotypes.\n\nNow, let's convert these counts into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- red-brown: 4/9\n- red-checkered: 2/9\n- plain-brown: 2/9\n- plain-checkered: 1/9\n\nSimplifying the ratios:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1 to make them whole numbers without common factors except 1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in my calculation, red-brown was 4, red-checkered 2, plain-brown 2, plain-checkered 1. Adding up to 9. But none of the options match exactly. Let me re-examine the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the cases. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 cross, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown (phenotype A)\n2. red-checkered (phenotype B)\n3. plain-brown (phenotype C)\n4. plain-checkered (phenotype D)\n\nIn terms of the F2:\n\n- red-brown occurs when either C or B is present. The only time it doesn't happen is when both C and B are recessive (cc bb), which is 1 case.\n- red-checkered occurs when C is present but B is recessive (cc BB or cc Bb). From the list, these are cases 3 and 6: 2 cases.\n- plain-brown occurs when B is present but C is recessive (cc BB or cc Bb): same as red-checkered, 2 cases.\n- plain-checkered occurs when both C and B are recessive (cc bb): 1 case.\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- red-brown: 4/9\n- red-checkered: 2/9\n- plain-brown: 2/9\n- plain-checkered: 1/9\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is 9:3:3:1, which seems different. Option H is 5:3:2:6, etc. None of the options directly match 4:2:2:1. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the correct phenotypic categories.\n\nAlternative approach: Use the Punnett square to calculate the phenotypic ratios directly.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and/or B is present (brown). So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain-brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThe probabilities are calculated as:\n\n- C present: 3/4\n- B present: 3/4\n- Both present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red-brown\n- Only C present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red-checkered\n- Only B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 plain-brown\n- Neither present: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9 cases red-brown,\n- 3 cases red-checkered,\n- 3 cases plain-brown,\n- 1 case plain-checkered.\n\nThis matches option G: 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 2:1:1:0.666..., which isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misrepresented the phenotype categories.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the color being checkered (both genes recessive), while \"plain\" refers to both genes dominant. But in reality, in genetics, the term \"checkered\" might refer to the color being a blend (like brown pigments blending with black), whereas \"plain\" refers to both dominant alleles. But in this context, I think \"checkered\" likely refers to both alleles being recessive, i.e., both genes showing the recessive trait.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering dominance, some genotypes may be expressed differently. Let me clarify the actual F2 genotypes. The F1 is CcBb. When selfed, the possible F2 genotypes include:\n\n1. CC: 25%\n2. Cc: 50% (from CB + cb and CB + cb)\nWait, no, the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Cc (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- cc (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (from CB + CB): 25%\n- Bb (from CB + cb or cb + CB): 50%\n- bb (from cb + cb): 25%\n\nSo the F2 genotype distribution combines these, resulting in nine possible genotypes. Now, for each genotype, we determine the phenotype based on the dominance hierarchy.\n\nPhenotype determination rules:\n\n- Pigment (gene C):\n  - C (dominant, red)\n  - c (recessive, plain)\n\n- Color (gene B):\n  - B (dominant, brown)\n  - b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo, each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B alleles. We'll use a Punnett square to combine the two loci.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (red)\n- 25% cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nNow, combining these, the F2 genotypes and phenotypes are as follows:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment C is dominant (red), Color B is dominant (brown). So overall red-brown.\n2. CC Bb: Same as above, red-brown.\n3. CC bb: Pigment red, but color is checkered (since B is recessive).\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red, color brown.\n5. Cc Bb: Red and brown.\n6. Cc bb: Red and checkered.\n7. cc BB: Plain color (since C is recessive), but color is brown.\n8. cc Bb: Plain color, brown.\n9. cc bb: Plain color, checkered.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when both C and B are present, the phenotype is determined by the dominant alleles. So for example, if an individual is Cc and BB, they would express red and brown, making them red-brown. Similarly, Cc Bb would also be red-brown.\n\nBut let's map each combination:\n\n- CC (C): dominates over cc. So all CC individuals have pigment C.\n- bb (b): dominates over BB. So all bb individuals have color b.\n\nThus, the phenotype depends on whether either C or b is present, and similarly for B and b.\n\nWait, no. Because the presence of C affects the pigment, and the presence of B affects the color. So for each individual:\n\nIf C is present (any C allele), then pigment is red (dominant).\n\nIf B is present (any B allele), then color is brown (dominant).\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by the presence of either C or b and B or b.\n\nWait, no, because C and B are separate loci. So:\n\n- If an individual has at least one C (so C is present), then pigment is red, regardless of B.\n- If an individual has at least one B (so B is present), then color is brown, regardless of C.\n- Thus, the phenotype is determined by the presence of either dominant allele in either gene.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined by whether the individual has at least one dominant allele in pigment (C) or at least one dominant allele in color (B). So any individual with at least one C (regardless of B) shows red pigment, any with at least one B (regardless of C) shows brown color. The combination could be red-brown, red-checkered, blue-brown, or blue-checkered, depending on the alleles.\n\nWait, but in our case, the alleles are C and B. So:\n\n- If C is present (either C or cc), pigment is red.\n- If B is present (either B or bb), color is brown.\n\nSo the phenotype is determined by whether pigment or color is present.\n\nNow, let's go back to constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nEach F2 bird inherits two alleles from each parent, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- For C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe combined genotypes would be all possible combinations, leading to 9 phenotypic categories, but many will overlap due to dominance.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the number of each phenotype based on the probabilities.\n\nLet's approach this systematically:\n\nPhenotype 1: Checkered (both C and b, and B and b)\nWait, no. Actually, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. So checkered would occur when neither C nor B is present. That is, when both alleles are recessive: cc and bb.\n\nWait, no. Because if an individual has even one dominant allele in pigment or color, they will exhibit the corresponding trait. So checkered would only occur if both C and B are recessive (cc bb). Otherwise, they will have at least one dominant allele and thus exhibit red pigment or brown color.\n\nWait, no, because if they have at least one dominant allele in pigment (C) or color (B), they will express the respective trait. So the absence of dominant traits (no C and no B) leads to checkered. That is:\n\n- If C is recessive (cc) AND B is recessive (bb), then both traits are absent: checkered.\n\nOtherwise, if at least one dominant trait is present, the bird will have either red pigment (if C is present) or brown color (if B is present), possibly both.\n\nWait, but since both C and B are independent, the presence of C allows for red pigment, and the presence of B allows for brown color. So, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Red-brown (has C and/or B)\n2. Red-checkered (only has C, no B)\n3. Brown-checkered (only has B, no C)\n4. Checkered (neither C nor B)\n\nSo now, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype.\n\nTo do this, we can compute the probabilities of having at least one dominant allele in pigment (C) or color (B).\n\nBut since these are independent traits, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in pigment is 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in color is 1 - (1/4) = 3/4.\n\nHowever, since these are independent events, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in either pigment or color is 1 - (probability of neither). Probability of neither is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. So probability of at least one dominant allele is 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.\n\nWait, but that's the probability of expressing a trait, not necessarily the phenotype. Because having at least one dominant allele doesn't mean the phenotype will be red or brown, but rather that the bird will have red or brown pigment or checkered.\n\nWait, no, because the presence of C allows for red pigment, and presence of B allows for brown color. So the presence of C OR B means the bird will have red or brown pigment or checkered.\n\nBut in reality, since each trait is determined independently, the presence of C ensures red pigment, presence of B ensures brown color. So the phenotype is determined by the combination of these traits.\n\nLet me try another approach. The total possible genotypes in F2 are:\n\n1. CC BB: All C and all B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb: C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n4. Cc BB: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n6. Cc bb: C and b \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n7. cc BB: c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb: c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb: c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, but according to dominance, any bird with at least one C will have red pigment, and any bird with at least one B will have brown color. So, let's categorize each bird:\n\n1. CC BB: Both C and B \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb: Both C and B \u2192 red-brown\n3. CC bb: C but not B \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n4. Cc BB: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb: C and B \u2192 red-brown\n6. Cc bb: C but not B \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 red-checkered\n7. cc BB: Not C but B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb: Not C but B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain-brown\n9. cc bb: Neither C nor B \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- red-brown: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 cases\n- red-checkered: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 2 cases\n- plain-brown: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 cases\n- plain-checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 cases, which makes sense since there are 9 possible genotypes.\n\nNow, let's convert these counts into phenotypic ratios:\n\n- red-brown: 4/9\n- red-checkered: 2/9\n- plain-brown: 2/9\n- plain-checkered: 1/9\n\nSimplifying the ratios:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1 to make them whole numbers without common factors except 1. So the ratio is 4 : 2 : 2 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Total 16\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Total 16\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Total 16\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Total 16\nE. 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Total 16\nF. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Total 16\nG. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Total 16\nH. 5:3:2:6 \u2192 Total 16\nI. 7:5:1:3 \u2192 Total 16\nJ. 2:6:3:1 \u2192 Total 12 (wait, this sums to 12)\nK. 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Total 16\nL. 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Total 16\n\nWait, J sums to 2+6+3+1=12, which isn't matching any of the given options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in my calculation, red-brown was 4, red-checkered 2, plain-brown 2, plain-checkered 1. Adding up to 9. But none of the options match exactly. Let me re-examine the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the cases. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 cross, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. red-brown (phenotype A)\n2. red-checkered (phenotype B)\n3. plain-brown (phenotype C)\n4. plain-checkered (phenotype D)\n\nIn terms of the F2:\n\n- red-brown occurs when either C or B is present. The only time it doesn't happen is when both C and B are recessive (cc bb), which is 1 case.\n- red-checkered occurs when C is present but B is recessive (cc BB or cc Bb). From the list, these are cases 3 and 6: 2 cases.\n- plain-brown occurs when B is present but C is recessive (cc BB or cc Bb): same as red-checkered, 2 cases.\n- plain-checkered occurs when both C and B are recessive (cc bb): 1 case.\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- red-brown: 4/9\n- red-checkered: 2/9\n- plain-brown: 2/9\n- plain-checkered: 1/9\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is 9:3:3:1, which seems different. Option H is 5:3:2:6, etc. None of the options directly match 4:2:2:1. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the correct phenotypic categories.\n\nAlternative approach: Use the Punnett square to calculate the phenotypic ratios directly.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and/or B is present (brown). So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain-brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThe probabilities are calculated as:\n\n- C present: 3/4\n- B present: 3/4\n- Both present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red-brown\n- Only C present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red-checkered\n- Only B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 plain-brown\n- Neither present: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9 cases red-brown,\n- 3 cases red-checkered,\n- 3 cases plain-brown,\n- 1 case plain-checkered.\n\nThis matches option G: 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 2:1:1:0.666..., which isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I misrepresented the phenotype categories.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the color being checkered (both genes recessive), while \"plain\" refers to both genes dominant. But in reality, in genetics, the term \"checkered\" might refer to the color being a blend (like brown pigments blending with black), whereas \"plain\" refers to both dominant alleles. But in this context, I think \"checkered\" likely refers to both alleles being recessive, i.e., both genes showing the recessive trait.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.",
    "chunk_resampled": "However, in reality, the segregation follows independent assortment, so the actual genotypes would be:",
    "rollout": " However, in reality, the segregation follows independent assortment, so the actual genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (25%) \n- Cc (25%) \n- cc (25%) \n- bb (25%)\n\nBut the phenotypes depend on the combination of C/c and B/b. So the F2 genotypes will determine the phenotypes. Let's map them.\n\nEach bird has two loci: C (dominant = red) and B (dominant = brown). So the phenotype is determined by both genes. The possible phenotypes are: \n\n- Checkered red (CC BB): both dominant\n- Checkered brown (CC bb): dominant C, recessive b\n- Plain red (cc BB): recessive c, dominant B\n- Plain brown (cc bb): recessive c, recessive b\n\nNow, let's consider all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. CC bb: Checkered brown\n3. cc BB: Plain red\n4. cc bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, but the F2 is the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, where F1 is CcBb. So each F2 individual can be:\n\n- CC (if two CB gametes combine)\n- Cc (if one CB and one cb)\n- cc (if two cb gametes combine)\n- bb (if one cb and one cb)\n\nSo now, the possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut wait, some of these genotypes may correspond to different phenotypes. Let's see:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (both dominant)\n- CC bb: Checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n- cc BB: Plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (both recessive)\n\nTherefore, in F2, all four genotypes occur equally (25% each), leading to four phenotypes. The phenotypic ratio would then be 1:1:1:1 if all four were equally likely, but in reality, due to dominance and codominance, some genotypes might lead to the same phenotype. Wait, but in this case, since both genes are independently assorting and dominant, each genotype leads to a distinct phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% for each phenotype.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options are A to H, each with specific counts. For example, option G says \"Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0\". That seems unlikely because all four phenotypes should appear equally in F2.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is flawed. Let me try another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of birds rather than percentages. If each F2 individual contributes equally to the next generation, the total number of offspring would be a multiple of 4. But without knowing the exact number, it's hard to calculate the count directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to assume that the F2 population includes all possible genotypes, regardless of phenotype, and sum up the phenotypes based on their occurrence. So, in F2, 25% are Checkered red (CC BB), 25% Checkered brown (CC bb), 25% Plain red (cc BB), 25% Plain brown (cc bb). So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. But in the options, none of them present 1:1:1:1. Wait, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Hmm, that doesn't fit 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the options. Looking back, the options are labeled from A to H, each giving different ratios. Option G is \"Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0\". That suggests that in F2, 12 are checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., totaling 16. But according to our analysis, each phenotype should occur 25%, so 4 outcomes. Without knowing the exact number of individuals, it's challenging to compute. However, the user provided a set of gametes, but perhaps the answer requires calculating the phenotypic ratio based on the Punnett square, considering the possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio for the F2 as observed in the actual offspring, considering that not all offspring may survive or have viable genotypes, but the question states \"phenotype\" refers to observable traits, so survival isn't considered here. Thus, focusing solely on the phenotypic distribution.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the possible genotypes and their phenotypes without assuming equal probability.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to list all possible F2 phenotypes and their counts. Since each F2 bird has a 25% chance for each genotype, each contributing to a specific phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Wait, looking back, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which totals 16. Similarly, option G is 12+2+2+0=16. None of them have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps the question is asking for the ratio based on the actual number of F2 birds, considering that not all offspring necessarily express the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the number of each phenotype, considering their proportion in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reconsider the possible genotypes and their contributions to the F2 generation. Let me create the Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will have four types of birds:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (Checkered red)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered brown)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (Checkered brown)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (Plain brown)\n\nBut each of these combinations will have a certain frequency. Specifically, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no. Actually, the Punnett square for F1 selfing (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) results in the following probabilities:\n\n- 25%: CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC BB (Checkered red)\n- 25%: CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 CC cb (Checkered brown)\n- 25%: cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc CC (Plain red)\n- 25%: cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc bb (Plain brown)\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory to what I thought before. Because when you cross CcBb with itself, you get four combinations, each with a 25% probability. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC cb: 25%\n- cc CC: 25%\n- cc cb: 25%\n\nBut when mapped to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC cb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc CC \u2192 Plain red\n- cc cb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 population. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, this still doesn't align with any of the provided options.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16 birds. Ratios 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3/16 : 9/16 : 1/16 : 3/16. This doesn't match 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Total 16. Ratio 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Simplified to 6:1:1:0. Again, not matching.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. Ratio 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Which is 1/16 : 3/16 : 9/16 : 3/16. Still not 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption B: Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16. Ratio 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Simplified to 2:1:0:1. Not matching.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 12. Not matching.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16. Ratio 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1. Ah! Here's a possibility. Option F presents a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which matches our calculation. But why didn't I notice this earlier?\n\nBecause when we analyze the F2 generation, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, resulting in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. So the correct answer should be the option that reflects this ratio. Looking at the options:\n\n- Option F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16. 4 each, so 1:1:1:1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, in reality, the segregation follows independent assortment, so the actual genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (25%) \n- Cc (25%) \n- cc (25%) \n- bb (25%)\n\nBut the phenotypes depend on the combination of C/c and B/b. So the F2 genotypes will determine the phenotypes. Let's map them.\n\nEach bird has two loci: C (dominant = red) and B (dominant = brown). So the phenotype is determined by both genes. The possible phenotypes are: \n\n- Checkered red (CC BB): both dominant\n- Checkered brown (CC bb): dominant C, recessive b\n- Plain red (cc BB): recessive c, dominant B\n- Plain brown (cc bb): recessive c, recessive b\n\nNow, let's consider all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. CC bb: Checkered brown\n3. cc BB: Plain red\n4. cc bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, but the F2 is the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, where F1 is CcBb. So each F2 individual can be:\n\n- CC (if two CB gametes combine)\n- Cc (if one CB and one cb)\n- cc (if two cb gametes combine)\n- bb (if one cb and one cb)\n\nSo now, the possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut wait, some of these genotypes may correspond to different phenotypes. Let's see:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red (both dominant)\n- CC bb: Checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive)\n- cc BB: Plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc bb: Plain brown (both recessive)\n\nTherefore, in F2, all four genotypes occur equally (25% each), leading to four phenotypes. The phenotypic ratio would then be 1:1:1:1 if all four were equally likely, but in reality, due to dominance and codominance, some genotypes might lead to the same phenotype. Wait, but in this case, since both genes are independently assorting and dominant, each genotype leads to a distinct phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% for each phenotype.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options are A to H, each with specific counts. For example, option G says \"Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0\". That seems unlikely because all four phenotypes should appear equally in F2.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is flawed. Let me try another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of birds rather than percentages. If each F2 individual contributes equally to the next generation, the total number of offspring would be a multiple of 4. But without knowing the exact number, it's hard to calculate the count directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to assume that the F2 population includes all possible genotypes, regardless of phenotype, and sum up the phenotypes based on their occurrence. So, in F2, 25% are Checkered red (CC BB), 25% Checkered brown (CC bb), 25% Plain red (cc BB), 25% Plain brown (cc bb). So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, meaning each phenotype occurs equally often. But in the options, none of them present 1:1:1:1. Wait, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Hmm, that doesn't fit 1:1:1:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the options. Looking back, the options are labeled from A to H, each giving different ratios. Option G is \"Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0\". That suggests that in F2, 12 are checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc., totaling 16. But according to our analysis, each phenotype should occur 25%, so 4 outcomes. Without knowing the exact number of individuals, it's challenging to compute. However, the user provided a set of gametes, but perhaps the answer requires calculating the phenotypic ratio based on the Punnett square, considering the possible genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio for the F2 as observed in the actual offspring, considering that not all offspring may survive or have viable genotypes, but the question states \"phenotype\" refers to observable traits, so survival isn't considered here. Thus, focusing solely on the phenotypic distribution.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the possible genotypes and their phenotypes without assuming equal probability.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to list all possible F2 phenotypes and their counts. Since each F2 bird has a 25% chance for each genotype, each contributing to a specific phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Wait, looking back, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which totals 16. Similarly, option G is 12+2+2+0=16. None of them have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Perhaps the question is asking for the ratio based on the actual number of F2 birds, considering that not all offspring necessarily express the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the number of each phenotype, considering their proportion in the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reconsider the possible genotypes and their contributions to the F2 generation. Let me create the Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will have four types of birds:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (Checkered red)\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (Checkered brown)\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (Checkered brown)\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (Plain brown)\n\nBut each of these combinations will have a certain frequency. Specifically, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no. Actually, the Punnett square for F1 selfing (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) results in the following probabilities:\n\n- 25%: CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC BB (Checkered red)\n- 25%: CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 CC cb (Checkered brown)\n- 25%: cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 cc CC (Plain red)\n- 25%: cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc bb (Plain brown)\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory to what I thought before. Because when you cross CcBb with itself, you get four combinations, each with a 25% probability. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC cb: 25%\n- cc CC: 25%\n- cc cb: 25%\n\nBut when mapped to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC cb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc CC \u2192 Plain red\n- cc cb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 population. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, this still doesn't align with any of the provided options.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16 birds. Ratios 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3/16 : 9/16 : 1/16 : 3/16. This doesn't match 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Total 16. Ratio 12:2:2:0 \u2192 Simplified to 6:1:1:0. Again, not matching.\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16. Ratio 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Which is 1/16 : 3/16 : 9/16 : 3/16. Still not 1:1:1:1.\n\nOption B: Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16. Ratio 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Simplified to 2:1:0:1. Not matching.\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 12. Not matching.\n\nOption F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16. Ratio 4:4:4:4 \u2192 1:1:1:1. Ah! Here's a possibility. Option F presents a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which matches our calculation. But why didn't I notice this earlier?\n\nBecause when we analyze the F2 generation, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, resulting in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. So the correct answer should be the option that reflects this ratio. Looking at the options:\n\n- Option F: Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16. 4 each, so 1:1:1:1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
